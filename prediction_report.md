**Series Prediction: Dplus KIA 3-2 OKSavingsBank BRION**

**Rationale:** Dplus KIA's consistent early-game dominance gives them a significant edge in a best-of-five series. While BRION has shown the ability to come back in later stages of games, their inability to consistently convert that resilience into wins suggests that Dplus KIA's early-game advantage will be a deciding factor in most games. However, BRION's potential to steal wins in longer games makes a clean sweep unlikely, leading to a 3-2 prediction in favor of Dplus KIA.

**Betting Insights:**

* **Match Winner:** Dplus KIA (Odds: 1.4) - Favored due to consistent early-game leads and higher probability of winning more games.
* **Series Score:** Dplus KIA 3-2 (Odds: 3.75) -  Reflects Dplus KIA's overall advantage while acknowledging BRION's potential to take games.  A 3-1 scoreline for Dplus KIA would also be a reasonable bet at slightly lower odds (e.g., 3.2).
* **Over/Under 4.5 Games:** Over (Odds: 1.8) -  Given the back-and-forth nature of previous matches and BRION's ability to extend games, a longer series is more likely.
* **First Tower:** Dplus KIA (Odds: 1.3) - Heavily favored based on their observed early-game aggression and objective control.
* **First Dragon:** Dplus KIA (Odds: 1.5) - While BRION has contested dragons effectively in some games, Dplus KIA's overall objective control suggests they are more likely to secure the first dragon.


**Potential Upsets:**

* **BRION 3-2 Dplus KIA (Odds: 4.5):** If BRION can shore up their early game and consistently translate their mid-to-late game strength into wins, they have the potential to upset Dplus KIA. This outcome relies on BRION improving their laning phase and effectively neutralizing Dplus KIA's early-game aggression.
* **BRION 3-1 Dplus KIA (Odds: 7.0):**  A less likely but still possible scenario where BRION consistently outperforms Dplus KIA in the mid-to-late game, capitalizing on any early-game stumbles by Dplus KIA.  This outcome is a higher-risk, higher-reward bet.
