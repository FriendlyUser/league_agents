Dplus KIA is heavily favored against OKSavingsBank BRION. Dplus KIA's consistent early-game lead and superior objective control, evidenced by their significantly higher gold difference at 15 and 25 minutes and a stronger first baron rate, suggest they are likely to dictate the pace of the series. While BRION's slightly higher first dragon rate hints at some early-game potential, they haven't been able to translate this into wins, indicating a weakness in converting early advantages into victories.  Therefore, I predict Dplus KIA will win the series 3-1.  BRION might be able to secure a game through a favorable draft or by exploiting a specific Dplus KIA weakness, but overall, Dplus KIA's consistent performance makes them the clear frontrunner.
