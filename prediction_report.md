Based on the comprehensive meta-analysis and the detailed match data retrieved, DRX is heavily favored to win this best-of-3 series against OKSB. The data shows DRX consistently securing gold advantages, controlling objectives like dragons and barons, and dealing significant damage in team fights. OKSB, conversely, struggles in all these areas, consistently falling behind in gold, failing to control objectives, and lacking sufficient damage output. The meta heavily favors DRX's playstyle, which is aggressive and focused on snowballing early leads.

Given these factors, my prediction is a **2-0 victory for DRX**. This is because the data shows the deficits that OKSB has often become too great to overcome, resulting in a decisive loss. It's unlikely OKSB will be able to secure even a single game against DRX, whose playstyle aligns so well with the current meta.

**Betting Insights:**

*   **DRX to win 2-0:** Odds should be very favorable for DRX, likely around 1.2 to 1.4. This is based on their superior performance, meta alignment, and the consistent data supporting their dominance.
*   **Over 2.5 games:** This bet is not recommended. The data suggests that OKSB struggles to even keep games competitive. An over 2.5 games bet has a low chance of hitting, and the odds should reflect that.
*   **First dragon to DRX:** Based on the data and analysis, DRX's high first dragon rate makes this a strong potential bet, with odds around 1.5 to 1.8.
*   **Total baron control to DRX:** Similar to the dragon control, DRX's high baron control makes this a likely scenario. Odds might be around 1.3 to 1.6

**Score Prediction:** 2-0 for DRX
