## gg.bet

Its interesting to see how the odds change over time, this can you let me know what the average better is thinking,

Given how gg.bet odds for bro have gone down, peopel are thinking bro is going to win, first chance I see the odds I need to gamble on bro, expecting them to go down.


As for DNF, the odds must be solid, bet on DNF, #1 challenger is still impressive.

fearx vs kt, seems like a fearx angle, kt is quite different, I can see them losing.

For dplus kia vs t1,

think bet small on t1, 

for geng vs hle, think bet on hle, they have zeus and its a b03, 

jan 17 bet on brion for bro vs ns

For dplus vs freec, bet small on freec

kt rolster vs hle, small bet

fearx vs geng

small bet on fearx
