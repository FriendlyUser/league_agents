**Betting Insights:**

Given the consistent performance data favoring Kwangdong Freecs (KDF) over Nongshim RedForce (NS), the clear objective control dominance, and the strength of their carries, KDF is heavily favored to win this series.

**Score Prediction:**

Kwangdong Freecs 3 - 0 Nongshim RedForce

**Betting Odds:**

*   **KDF to Win:** 1.12 (Strongly favored)
*   **NS to Win:** 6.00 (Significant underdog)

**Explanation:**

KDF has demonstrated a consistent ability to secure early game objectives, snowball leads, and efficiently close out games. Their data shows a clear advantage in gold, dragons, barons, and overall team fight performance against NS. The data is overwhelming in favor of KDF. NS has consistently failed to secure early objectives and demonstrate a significant deficit in their ability to convert advantages into wins. The likelihood of NS winning the series is very low based on the performance data. Therefore, betting on a KDF victory is the most logical choice, while a bet on NS would be a high-risk, high-reward gamble. The 3-0 prediction reflects KDF's consistent ability to dominate NS across the various games.
