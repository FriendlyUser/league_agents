Match Analysis

Gen.G decisively won the series 2-0, demonstrating superior team coordination and individual skill, particularly from Ruler and Chovy.

Game 1:

Early Game: HLE secured an early kill on Kiin with a dive, but Gen.G quickly turned it around, demonstrating their focus on objective control. Gen.G were able to gain a considerable lead with an early six grub advantage.

Mid Game: Gen.G continued to outmaneuver HLE, taking down a turret and securing the Dragon uncontested. The pace of the game felt slow, with Gen.G taking objectives at their own pace and HLE being unable to pressure them.

Late Game: Gen.G utilized a combined push with Rift and then adakan, and then closed out the game with the Baron, leaving no avenues of comeback for HLE.

Key Factors:

Gen.G's superior control of objectives.

Ruler's consistent damage output on Ash.

HLE's inability to convert early skirmishes into a significant advantage.

Chovy's ability to deny counterplay with well-timed ultimates.

Game 2:

Early Game: Ruler got first blood in a fight bot, showing his strength on a comfort pick in the Jinx. Again, they traded grubs for dragons, but Gen.G's map pressure allowed for a lead in both of these situations. HLE tried a dive mid for Baron control, which failed with the Gen.G rotation.

Mid Game: Gen.G continued to maintain control, and Ruler's Jinx was too big of a threat for HLE. The map control and vision enabled them to find advantageous fights.

Late Game: Gen.G were able to secure Elder, Baron, and then take down the HLE base for the game two victory.

Key Factors:

Ruler's exceptional performance on Jinx, turning into a hyper carry.

Gen.G's ability to isolate and shut down HLE's members while protecting ruler.

HLE's struggles to deal with Gen.G's superior team coordination and objective control.

Chovy's consistency as a damage threat and tank when needed.

Performance Analysis

Gen.G:

Ruler: A standout performer in both games, particularly with his Jinx in game 2. His positioning, damage output, and understanding of the comp was key.

Chovy: Consistent in his lane, and providing high damage and good setup for his team. Showed great flexibility with the Gallo.

Canyon: Did his job in setting up the team, with well times Smite steals and map control.

Kiin: Played his role well, and was able to get a lead in the top lane.

Duro: Performed as a consistent support for Ruler, enabling his carries and providing utility.

Hanwha Life Esports (HLE):

Zeus: Had some good plays, but was mostly zoned out from XP in side lanes, or could not push the advantage.

Peanut: Made a few high-impact plays but was often caught out of position and overextended.

Zeka: Was ineffective in both games, despite being on comfort picks. Could not create an impact and often got caught out.

Viper: Had a decent early game on Caitlyn in game one and was unable to have much impact on Tristana in game two. Was too aggressive at times and did not respect Ruler's lead.

Delight: Performed some nice engages and roams but overall was lacking. His Bard picks were not very effective.

How Close Were the Matches?

The matches were not very close, particularly the second. Here's the breakdown:

Game 1: HLE had an early lead, but that slowly evaporated as Gen.G took control. While HLE had opportunities, Gen.G's superior coordination made it an easy victory.

Game 2: Gen.G dominated from the start and completely shut down HLE's avenues for a comeback.

Overall Performance

Gen.G: Demonstrated excellent team coordination, individual skill, and flexibility. Their drafts were designed to allow for a smooth mid and late game, and they executed that plan flawlessly. Ruler had some incredible team fights and damage potential, and he was a strong carry for the team.

Hanwha Life Esports (HLE): Looked disorganized, struggled with individual plays, and were unable to find answers to Gen.G's compositions. There were some problems with execution and a lack of respect for their opponents' compositions.

Summary

Gen.G looked like a well-oiled machine, showcasing a potent combination of individual talent and strategic teamwork. The return of Ruler has seemingly elevated the team to a new level. HLE, on the other hand, looked out of sync and struggled to execute their strategies. They need to re-evaluate their approach to both the draft and in-game execution. The difference in individual skill was also apparent, where Ruler, Chovy, and Juro outmatched HLE's members.
