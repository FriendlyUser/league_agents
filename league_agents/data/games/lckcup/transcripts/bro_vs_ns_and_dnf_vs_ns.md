23:48
hello everyone the weights is over the 2025 lck season is Right Upon Us welcome
23:56
everyone to the space for the first time of the 2025 season I'm your host Daniel
24:01
degon Gonzalez to kick things off I'm joined by chronicler and Ox welcome
24:07
gentlemen how was your offseason and how excited are you for the season to kick off it was wonderful but I'm going to be honest near the end I was I was missing
24:13
purpose I was just sitting at home playing solo qu and it's just not the same but now the LSK is back and purpose
24:19
is refound in my life I've missed a lot and we have a new revamped space which is which is so sick I feel like just
24:26
really sets the tone for new season I forgot during the opening event you were on the casting desk so you didn't get
24:31
yeah I didn't get experien this yeah well we've got brand new 225 lck format
24:38
for you three splits and so now the lck has adjusted with the first ever lck cup
24:46
the inaugural lck cup where teams have been divided into two groups of five the
24:51
top teams will play into a playoffs that will qualify for the first ever International Event first stand we will
24:58
then come back into the lck regular season which is two portions rounds one and two which is very familiar think of
25:04
it like a spring summer split double round robin with qual uh qualifiers 2 MSI then we come back the scores will
25:12
count from the first round by being divided into different groups and the top teams will play in playoffs which
25:18
then from those playoffs we will know who our world's participants will be no world's qualifiers this time yeah and we
25:25
will have more Internationals and more CK games with this new format so there
25:30
is it's only good things yeah and while I'm going to miss the regional qualifier created some amazing Stories there's
25:36
actually a ton of like little planes little playoff segments strewn up throughout the year so we still get a
25:41
lot of that same energy yeah well let's take a look at the lck cup specifically
25:46
with the overview of how it works we've got the best of three group battles so still best of three but as we said
25:52
earlier the teams have been divided up and drafted into two groups of five team
25:58
Elder and team Baron and they will do battle the top teams from the group will
26:04
qualify straight to playoffs everyone else will have to play in plans except the worst team in the losing Group which
26:11
is really cool cuz for the first time ever if you are geni you're now incentivized to cheer for Nong shim uh
26:18
unfortunately for ruler still can't get away from lens stay for KT and this
26:24
creates a whole new Dynamic that normally we don't really get to talk about unless it's you know some crazy thing like the season opening and
26:30
obviously being the winning group is a big Advantage but if your favorite team does end up being the losing group as
26:36
Deon said there are still opportunities to make it further in the tournament they'll just have to prove themselves I mean group Baron they've got the winners
26:42
they've got the pre the current lck champion the current world champion and the current kases kaspa Cup champion
26:48
with the Bros on in there as well uh unique to this season as well in this portion of the Season Fearless draft and
26:56
we're not doing the soft Fearless where okay you get to play it then we get to play it it's hard for it's the first
27:01
time you see it whether it's picked or banned by either team that'll be the last time you see it all series long and
27:06
it's going to be super impactful I mean I feel like the fact that getting to the end of the best of five 50 Champion
27:12
bands is so massive especially when we look at rols like ad8 carries where really it feels like the pool is quite
27:17
thin we've already seen teams uh on this new patch picking up a lot more Mages I think that'll have to be the meta
27:24
because you're just going to get H cooked out of these ad0 carry picks so quickly in a series and when we get to game three it's
27:30
already going to be noticeable but having watched the in Challenger last year as well like especially game four and five in a series cuz the first
27:35
couple of games they still a lot of meta picks but things get really weird and it will really I hope uh showcase the depth
27:42
of champion pools of some of our players yeah and as we cover all the changes that are happening this season we'll highlight which ones are our favorite
27:48
and this one is my favorite because a lot of the time when we're playing solo quue we want to try to see what the pros do and emulate that but you know you got
27:56
a one trick that doesn't want to play the a champ he doesn't want to play tank top well now we get to see what happens with our Pros when their champ pool gets
28:03
even larger especially when we get to Best of fives that's going to be a lot of fun uh a lot of roster changes have
28:10
been made as well not just the patches but transfers the rotating uh seats have been moved around
28:17
and it all starts with that one right there in the top left corner Hana Life zus That's Right zus Moving on over to
28:24
the Champs and sometimes you know you're like okay you pick this guy I picked this no this is the pickup of the
28:29
offseason this is the most talked about transfer and it should be because this is a guy that has been contesting for it
28:35
worst second best top laner in the world and for the last three years he's an incredible player and it felt like H
28:41
life couldn't really get any better with say's acquisition I think they did yeah I mean they had a really strong summer obviously wi in the title Wills is a
28:48
little bit underwhelming I think Doren did underperform in that series and Zas I think everyone has kind of said it
28:53
consistently he's just been such a force to be reckoned with in the Top Lane H looks like a God Squad right now do like
29:00
uh Duro having a similar test like the light did in a similar position coming up from a weaker team called up to ji
29:07
where he used to play in Challengers and now you know I got to talk about my boy shiu he is making it to the big leagues
29:14
uh really exciting player someone that even in the short time he was in challenges already made a huge name for
29:20
himself and the other one is rud Ruda coming back to the lck this is a cultural institution basically this guy
29:25
for so many years was exceptional was very close to clearing the golden rope before T1 and Faker blocked him now back
29:32
where he's supposed to be on geni and I'm looking at the Bros H back and hype uh in challenges basically achieving
29:38
everything they can in challenges winning everything that they could and then going on to perform in the Kasper
29:43
cup and show up in a way that really surprised people cuz especially cuz bro have tended to be this team who are a
29:48
bit slower paced take a while to get going even when they win it feels like they're kind of just doing it this has
29:55
been a team where they really drove the pace of the games the Casper cup and especially with the meta where we've seen it leaning more towards early game
30:02
pressure these feat of strength they dominated and they don't need to be good cuz they're the Bros but I think they
30:08
will be which is crazy it's been many years and I'm not I'm not I'm not
30:14
generally the Bro guy but you know today oh do we have a bro guy I'm wearing appropriate colors do we do we have a bro guy maybe one of the casters you
30:21
know maybe should maybe one of the cas I just feel like proud dad proud dad president Pao getting the support that
30:26
he needs and some hard where to go with the congratulations to the Bros winning the kesper cup in 2024 but we are in
30:33
2025 now and there has been a lot of uh League already played LPL has already
30:39
kicked it on off they did they do best of fives so we've gotten to see what it's been like with the Fearless draft
30:45
it hasn't always gone to a best of five I think none of them have gone best of five yet but here's the picks yeah nothing has changed uh scarner is still
30:52
insanely strong I think the strongest jungler by a large margin I'm sure we'll still see them but he feels like Cut
30:58
Above and Arcane hit that's Victor in the secondary you might not recognize him he's had a bit of a makeover is a
31:04
top tier pick here as well yeah definitely feels like it's still small sample size from these but just a little bit of looking at some of the pcks you
31:10
know CU still there sadly and all disappointed by that one uh and Bessa there as well as you said Victory with
31:17
Arcane and with lccl all these aggressive ad carries like kalista ash Baris that have a lot of setup oily
31:23
pressure and which makes sense cuz you can generally have a lot more control Lane and taking to taking fist wood big
31:29
objectives right now all right well speaking of some changes what have been the most exciting changes for you guys
31:35
Chronicle you go first so I'm going to start with kind of an obvious one you know new season is always fun but I am
31:42
going to talk about adakan now you might see this and go like man that's a lot of text don't worry don't worry about ruin asadon we're not going to see him in the
31:49
he's not real he can't hurt you but objectives to me also always have such a
31:54
big impact in how the game is played so the a buff is insane I'm not necessarily
32:00
uh too exciting about or excited about what the actual buff is but an objective particularly one of strong as Aon I
32:06
think he hurts even more than Baron completely shreds teams as well changes so much on how you need to move around
32:12
the map uh it changes how teams look at objectives I want to Coster mind back to Harold remember how long it took for
32:18
everyone to figure that one out see if ticon is the same uh ax how about you what is the biggest change this is it's
32:24
not the biggest but this is a niche one that I think is actually really cool specifically Nexus turrets now respawning cuz I feel like we sometimes
32:31
had these games where the Nexus turrets go down and the game is over you know the it haven't hasn't actually ended but
32:37
this chances just gone because you can't leave your base to contest any neutrals you kind of locked in cuz someone can easily back door now with the turrets
32:43
responding it means we have less games that are done before the the clock is run out before the NEX is exploded which
32:49
I think is going to make the game more competitive and even if it doesn't happen every game it just gives these teams a Fighting Chance yeah and you
32:55
know uniquely there's been a lot of talk about these changes on how it's affected pace of play and snowballing uh Riot
33:01
fren came on and showed the data again two days of data but showed the data that is of last patch to now and not a
33:09
lot of changes here Ox yeah I think the takeaway is little bit F like a little bit higher win rate on Fierce turret a
33:14
little bit faster games but I think going into the new season in Solo qu everyone was saying oh it's so fast
33:19
paced know the feature strength FF after Fierce blood the stats have shown and again early days but kind of that isn't
33:26
that drastic of a change the fact is that although we have these Feats of Strength you now don't have the extra gold for fce blood the extra gold for
33:32
fierce Tower so there has been trade-offs to keep the games still in a a roughly similar state with how
33:38
impactful objectives are all right and going back to chronicler's point earlier the aons uh haven't seen too much
33:43
ruinous a lot of voracious Aon how many ruinous aons are we going to see uh
33:49
we've got these guys here at one maybe one with more fighting more fighting means ruinous that's yeah so this is
33:54
already we took a huge Risk by going for one so I I don't know what what the the the two plus people are looking at but
34:01
for me I I think it's most likely zero but I'm like we have one team I got to
34:06
sit in some SC during the offseason we got to see a lot of ruinous Aon I think after the first couple of games then
34:13
teams are going to start fighting a lot more like what do on scrims yeah yeah yeah yeah everyone scrims translate one
34:20
to one at LC we all know that that's uh tried and tested you you practice like you play and now it's time for you to
34:27
answer some question questions not not not practice but play deon's noxian fact
34:32
of the week boom colors as well colors coordinated
34:38
for the season let's get to it this one not so noxian but we've got a tough one
34:44
for you here and you at home can play as well you can now subscribe to the lck
34:49
twitch Channel true or false I mean I wish this this isn't a thing right I
34:55
wish it was true very good straight face o very straight face already subed by
35:01
the way come on come already definitely not come on now Deon we're not in the past that's not a thing is is what we

36:22
again returning from last season to this season is the Udi Bank gold King it's a player with the highest average gold
36:28
earn per week so group battle week one 2 3 four playin playoffs uh they will win
36:34
a silver sterling silver coin and a golden bar if you were the winner of the
36:40
Year also it was probably the coolest award during it was a Golden Crown for
36:45
aiming it was actually it was the coolest one so thank you to Wy Bank coming on back with that one time to
36:51
take a look at this week's schedule as we've got matches lined up for you and
36:57
if you Jo this part of the show as chronicler said it kind of looks like normal yeah nothing nothing has changed
37:03
is what you might think that's obviously not true uh cuz these are two separate teams consisting of five lck teams that
37:09
are facing off against one another but let's be honest most players are focused on their own achievements and I think we have a lot of very competitive matches
37:16
T1 versus TK uh rematch of The Gauntlet but let's be real what everyone's going
37:21
to be looking at is that Friday match yeah that's a good one um you know uh it wasn't too long ago that we saw that one
37:26
before and it was pretty hype then so I'm excited to see how it goes down and both teams having roster changes I feel
37:32
like always spices it up uh I don't know what you guys are talking about we're getting to see the kespa cup the reigning kespa Cup champions take on
37:38
former world champions at DRX in match number one and then later on today uh the newly named DN freaks up against
37:47
Nong shim red force that is today's matches and time to go to predictions as
37:54
again we've got ourselves the group Elder and and group Baron yesterday or
37:59
last year chronicler was right with his predictions he is the winner who does he go with he has a nice little split here
38:05
five and five uh what jumps out of you as we take a look at the predictions here Ox um I feel like a lot of people pretty
38:13
pretty big on bro understandably after the Kasa cup win uh n getting a lot of
38:18
love in that one today only udon going for the DN freaks there so there's
38:23
little deviances but this is kind of what we expect generally I will say it is inter inter to note that we've seen
38:29
uh Team Baron I believe which is the purle one right on the right with leaning more towards them I mean chonic
38:35
and Atlas are even but everyone else is in favor of Team Baron right now yeah I'm I'm just more shocked uh that the
38:42
geni H live matches is one side I I do think obviously H life exceptional but looking domestically I think geneng G
38:48
have been such a incredible power hour over the last couple years and I know his world's performance wasn't great but
38:54
you know who was great spring chovi spring chovy was great for me picking the DN freaks we didn't get to talk
39:00
about it in transfers it's a debut for the North American MVP Berserker who
39:05
obviously started his career here in Korea part of the T1 system in the academy tier three league and coming
39:11
back on up Ox what's that face for go ahead nothing I'm just you know I'm I'm pretty hyped about baz it's him and Mark
39:18
you know you got you got the the na Boys I Get It Deon na Imports a lot of Pride
39:23
there Deon you know yeah I I'm just really excited we got a little bit more time before we kick off all the action
39:29
predictions here on how many who's going to get the first Blood here because obviously first blood has been just
39:36
heightened with the Feats of Strength now part of the game hok yeah I like
39:41
that one I think that's a pretty safe bet I think I mean if you look at Bros C performance they were on fire in the 80
39:47
game and fierce blood means a lot you got a really strong jungler coming in I think they're going to be gun him for it
39:52
yeah it just feels like with Beats of strength all of the sudden the game has now something to play for a lot earlier
39:58
on other than the level three Tower dive that everyone's been doing since 2023 yeah particularly having played I've
40:03
already played like 40 50 games uh not as more than you realistically should but that Fe is strength the back and
40:09
forth I think it's really fun I can only hope it feels the same in Pro all right that's set the table for the 2025 season
40:16
the lck cup kicks off right now with bro versus DRX see you in a bit
40:32

41:51
y
41:59
welcome ladies and gentlemen to the lck cup the very first time that we're getting into official competition here
42:05
for 2025 at LOL Park and I am so happy that it is back wolf how you feeling man
42:11
doesn't it feel great to be back it's been a really long off season I'm so excited to be back we've got new teams
42:18
new rosters big changes to the rift a new format and it's going to be a great
42:23
year maybe potentially the best year ever for the lck I agree the fact that turrets are now guns is like kind of
42:30
awesome not going to lie certainly a whole lot more changes as well and we're going to be diving deep into Fearless if
42:35
you've been a challenger fan for a long time then you'll know exactly what's going on if you've been recently watching a bunch of LPL then you'll also
42:42
know exactly what's going on but this is a new thing here in the lck and we're excited to see what it's going to bring
42:49
here for our preliminary tournament the lck cup very very cool style as well as far as how these groups have turned out
42:55
and wolf as far as predictions were concerned when you were making your predictions were you thinking about Elder versus Baron because I have to
43:01
admit I was not even in the slightest well you know we'll talk about that a little bit when we get uh talking about
43:07
the format a little bit more but I didn't really think about that much I was thinking more individually speaking of individually this roster the kaspa
43:13
Cup champions here BR it could be the year of bro they've got the little bees on the Jersey as well you love to see it
43:20
hot coming in as one of the most hyped prospects from Challengers along with Shu of course they're kind of buying for that top position closer moving from uh
43:28
BN K into this roster and then hype who's on loan from KT rollster is an incredible ad carry they have bull as
43:34
backup for when they do play against KT rollster as well as potentially because his style is very different if they want to play something a little bit more
43:39
early game especially in Fearless they might Tech Bull in to a draft or two in this tournament we'll have to wait and
43:45
see but this team if you haven't been paying attention definitely stronger than what you'd expect if you look at
43:50
the results last year yep and having a look over the side of DRX there are definitely some old names that you may
43:57
remember one uh that a certain member of this particular desk knows extraordinarily well is Rich we used to
44:03
call him the faker of Hots Hots doesn't exist anymore well it does but it doesn't really and uh Rich was the guy
44:08
he's come over once again to see what he can do and uh this team is actually kind
44:14
of shaping up to be kind of awesome UK coming back as well really exciting lazy feel our very first Vietnamese import
44:21
would be uh very very cool if it was a better story um because of course Teddy unfortunately not feeling so good but
44:26
let's dive into the interview and then we can get into all
44:56
that for
45:55
fighting
46:17
[Music]
46:25
for
46:55
for fore
47:36
this great to hear from both the xkt boys from Challenger moving over to Brion and also from lazy field kind of
47:44
weird man having like a translated interview with a new player and even like having a look at the stat sheet you
47:50
see a Vietnamese flag on an lck team it's nutty it's so cool it's so cool
47:55
we're uh witnessing history here at the lck you know since CLG EU played so many
48:01
years ago we haven't had a a you know non- Korean player participate in a
48:06
Korean League of Legends League nor I mean not the main one the lck um you know nor we have we had them as part of
48:12
a main roster and you know a lot of the time people thought that they would maybe come when we had a new hyped
48:18
player from overseas training in Korea who then worked his way into the lck but
48:24
I don't want to say lazy field doesn't deserve it because he has had phenomenal performances in Challengers one of the big prospects I was looking at coming
48:31
into this year potentially especially if Teddy underperformed Teddy's ill today so lazy feel steps into the spotlight
48:37
definitely going to be a big name to live up to one of the biggest Legends of the ad carry role he is filling big
48:44
shoes today absolutely and you know Teddy's shoes have been filled by Young Guns in the past um one by the name of
48:51
Gushi does come to mind and he's done pretty well with himself and so hopefully lazy field can follow in these
48:57
uh these footsteps of this legend that is Teddy as Bros always standing
49:03
together here The Vibes in bro have been absolutely phenomenal was the case in uh
49:08
Kasper cup as well where they were the victors and now Rich joining DRX here on
49:14
the other side is going to hit someone with a book um so yeah these are B yeah
49:19
the te okay textbooks for the roles it's actually like the same meme I used for my bud CH brand it's basically the basic
49:27
textbook for what what they're they're listing as their role for roaming for him and for carrying for lazy feel and
49:34
he's got Teddy here as well a Teddy's actually here and his is Vision yeah okay andle
49:40
really good at seeing things absolutely fantastic I think the new ruin is going to be helping him out there as
49:45
well um great I love the meme I know it's actually really really cool really well done I think andle's probably the
49:52
one though on this DRX roster that has to play the best because he's got ple behind him w and that guy is really good
49:58
uh he's on that Challenger team once again but uh can be called up at a moment's notice Edgar making his way out
50:04
once again and I think if you're Edgar you are the happiest you have ever been at the start of a season ever since you
50:11
joined this team absolutely some things never change but now Edgar's got this
50:17
Powerhouse roster that I think before Kasa cup started we were optimistic about but after watching The KES Cup
50:22
results you know again there are some asteris there they weren't playing against full rer minus D plus Kia who they did defeat um this team looked
50:30
really good their early game especially has been a strong point for them it reminds you of the umpty days when the general would lead this team to early
50:37
games but they sometimes stumbled in the mid game or leading into objectives they made rash decisions and would fall apart
50:43
this Pro roster has so far been able to stick the landing when you look at their cbook Cup results Rich returning to
50:48
Korea also playing on na recently after playing in the LPL where had some good results on V5 we'll see what he can get
50:55
done here because he's seen a lot right he's lived through two different regions after some Ming performances here in the
51:01
lck probably coming back with a lot more wisdom I would agree um he's also you know done some work with the lck as well
51:08
we've learned a lot more about rich with the the extra content and it's absolutely fantastic that we now get him
51:13
back into the lck once again joined by Sponge who is sticking around of course
51:19
there is so much of this DRX roster that has changed one of the parts that hasn't is sponge and I'm very happy to see it
51:24
cuz this guy I think has a long way ahead of him um speaking of changes Clos
51:30
are moving over to the Bros and at first I was like this feels weird but after
51:35
witnessing what they were doing at the kesper cup I think that this is exactly where closer belongs oh yeah I mean get
51:41
this guy fed get this guy ahead UK's return as well super hyped for me he's
51:46
had you know a really tough time over in the LPL he played on Thunder talk wasn't able to find a lot of success there but
51:52
despite having a sub 50% win rate he's actually got big laning stats he's ahead at CS he's ahead at gold at 15 minutes
51:59
on average he had a pretty good performance individually in the mid lane even though his team didn't have great results so I think a a player that
52:06
people should look out for even those results recently haven't really said as much and then man talking about the
52:12
bottom Lane for bro Paulo has really stepped into his own with hype joining
52:17
the team and they look like a completely different Duo than anything we saw from them last year and then the main man of
52:24
the day I mean lazy fi coming in pick picked up P just last night one MVP
52:31
playing for Challengers didn't interview on stage they brought his translater there he had a lot to say about his
52:36
communication he's picked up a lot of Korean he calms in Korean with his team speaks English when he there's a word he
52:42
doesn't know he said the most exciting part about living in Korea now he's been in Korea for a year as in Vietnam they
52:47
don't really have winter they don't have cold weather and he said it's been such a joy to experience the cold weather here in hey I can relate to that
52:54
entirely uh 2018 was a very interesting time for me I had to buy a jacket for the very first time in my life and I
53:00
assume lazy field had an a very similar experience getting the big jacket is
53:05
just such like it's like a Coming of Age moment is what it feels like um when you are here in career cuz it does get
53:11
extraordinarily cold today is an example of that but it is now time to put him to the test in the lck kind of crazy that
53:18
like we were watching him yesterday in Challenger and now immediately brought up thankfully he had a good experience
53:24
because if it was a bit of a rough timeing Challenger yesterday then this could be a very different story however lazy field even from what
53:30
we saw previously in the the kesper cup where he spent the entirety of the time T he didn't play at all um he looked
53:37
pretty good so we're going to be diving into the draft here and of course big change is going to be that this is
53:42
fearless no one has any fear you're not allowed to be scared if we sense fear on the stage you will be removed
53:48
immediately so while there are no changes to the first draft in that no Champions have been played so there's no
53:55
additional banss things like first pick become so incredibly important because you get to not only have that B1 champ
54:01
that you want that you want to prioritize but you can deny your opponent from playing it throughout the entirety of the series as well by just
54:07
locking it in and I wonder how much strategy is going to come from like if we pick this Champion then our draft for
54:15
the next game is going to be so much better and investor three like this buying yourself space for a game two and
54:21
then having even more for a game three could be something to play into but we haven't necessarily SE too much of that
54:27
it's more about let's just pick the good stuff that we can find and see if we can make a composition as yeah um yeah and
54:34
also double lazy field bands feels very respectful you to see that he's played in Challengers as well so scarner has
54:41
been the Talk of the Town has been basically banned completely in the LPL
54:47
and has been played a ton in Challengers or banned every time um when he's left available he's install locked he is left
54:53
open in this case with the Aurora ban that's where I'm expecting we're going to go y that will be the case here for hok's
54:59
debut and now you know with the ban on the azir I wonder what UK has in mind
55:05
here the a ad carry pool especially in terms of early bullies has been thinned out so things like the Ezreal do become
55:11
a little bit more appealing here potentially for lazy field Victor is one of UK's old favorites he played a ton in
55:17
the lck and that's also a champion that's gotten recently buffed yeah it's actually kind of insane that you know we
55:23
remember him you know back in 2018 saving KT um bringing them to Worlds against
55:29
Griffin and he was playing this Champion a whole bunch back then and it is going to be coming out once more the Cori going to be locked in here for lazy Feld
55:35
as well I believe this is one of the Champions that he played a little bit um inup he also got a with it yesterday as
55:43
well so he's he's very proficient at the champion closer he loves his melee mids
55:50
and if you've watched this guy over the last few years you know that it's no surprise he'll be locking in Yon State
55:56
yon is in right now very strong pick here and we'll see Sani taken on the
56:02
other side not any Synergy built up for Perma Frost just yet in this draft however yeah that uh worries me a little
56:08
bit of course sponge is very confident on the Sani was all last year um but hopefully we do see something coming uh
56:15
from somewhere else I mean at least a support that is somewhat La would be great can help set up gravity well for
56:21
Victor stuns as well so you can kind of lock people in there set up a secondary stun with the ultimate ambessa feels
56:28
like a no-brainer here as that's kind of the missing piece for DRX at this moment in time and has some pretty good cnergy
56:34
with sedani on the side of DX you just want to stop any sort of pushing bullying Lane for this corki in the
56:40
bottom side so we'll see both kaisa who is very strong into the corki and the
56:45
zigs that has incredible power early on taken off the board and then JX you
56:50
definitely the biggest one that sticks in your mind in terms of available Champions here that works well with Sani
56:55
what should be A N I just I just feel like it's going to be Nar for Rich um in the end hype what is he going to be
57:01
picking up here because of course the two AP choices that you going to be going towards have been banned away we were seeing this all throughout the
57:07
kesper cup and then uh immediately afterwards as well try and eliminate some of the more common Mages from the
57:13
bottom Lane can theoretically just play anything like a cnra if you feel like it but hype is more of that stock standard
57:20
I'm going to play an ad carry kind of guy Mis Fortune is going to come in re's been performing incredibly well now this
57:26
is cool cuz you get to see what the bottom Lane is yeah you blinded the uh Leona but now maybe you're like how
57:31
immobile is that bottom Lane do I want to play something like Camille which has been popping up a little bit here and works decently well with the Sani
57:38
something that also gives you some good s lane power or is it just going to be the Nar you mentioned try to bully the
57:43
cassan out of the lane pretty good into scarner as well Jace has been cropping back up it's one of Rich's old favorites
57:49
and he is going to lock it in here so a lot of poke but there's a lot of front line to break through I think a very
57:55
risky decision to go for Jace considering that massive front line that bro have online already yeah and I think
58:01
that Derrick's going to really have to give Rich some attention in the early stages of the game because if if Morgan
58:07
even just goes even for like the first bit of the game I don't think that uh Jace is ever getting through this
58:13
cassant especially if huk is anywhere near like those health bars are absurdly large that is just a lot of tankiness
58:20
that they have available feel like uh okay Savings Bank pron have come out of this draft feeling pretty powerful but
58:26
there is certainly still a lot of expressiveness on the DRX side UK coming
58:31
back with one of his favorite Champions rich like you say full Comfort there on the top side of the map and sponge was
58:36
the sichani guy so I guess it's Comfort versus comp to start off this LC I think
58:41
that's a great way to put it and I do think that the Simplicity of the composition we have for DRX is definitely there there's a lot of burst
58:48
damage and single Target CC so the Leona Sani setup can be quite good when you
58:53
follow up with an accelerated shock blast if you can find the thread the needle into that Misfortune or try to
58:58
punish her when she's channeling her ultimate there's definitely some things that you can find success with in this trap but I think it is going to be very
59:04
challenging against a team that's already got so much Synergy as the Bros do and when you consider the roles that
59:11
Morgan and hok are going to be playing in terms of front line they have to be positioned very well because Misfortune
59:16
is otherwise going to be a very vulnerable Target here I would agree just have to see how it is all going to
59:21
come together because there is so much CC the amount of hold them in position so I can kill them with with my cone um
59:27
is very large here for hype I think that guy could certainly be getting some kills this game unless lazy feel has
59:33
something to say about it the very first time a Vietnamese player has played in the lck let's get into
59:49
it all right here we are ladies and gentlemen onto the rift for the very first game of the lck cup and yes the
59:55
very first time we're seeing an import onto the L Park stage it is kind of
1:00:02
insane you mentioned like the caveat that we have to always put down is the fact that CLG euu played um sort of in
1:00:09
the lck I guess in quotation marks in Champions yeah yeah in Champions back in the day back in 2012 um they're in the
1:00:16
final casted by double lift mol trap and Valdez uh which we always get reminded
1:00:21
of uh cuz it's just very strange that was of course 13 years ago now yeah it's
1:00:26
been a long time we'll have a lane swap in our first game of the year here but
1:00:32
it will be matched so neither team will actually get an advantage oo that's called Australian style yeah we are just
1:00:39
making things upside down uh right now it looks like DRX do not have all the information as to where hype and po are
1:00:46
yeah Rich is hiding behind his turret likewise will be Morgan and now they'll
1:00:52
reveal each other sweeper down for Paulo yep well it's uh I'll raise you
1:00:57
your uh Lane swap with another Lane Swap and therefore nullify the lane swap so I
1:01:03
guess it's theoretical but it's not quite working out and of course there have been a few changes here haven't there wolf as far as how Lane swaps are
1:01:09
going to happen the amount of protection is not quite there as much the top side uh turret protection for plates has been
1:01:15
reduced uh on this patch and mid has also been reduced but not going to be important to mention in this specific
1:01:22
case but both of those did get nerfed now rich is going to have to space really well here on Jace if he ends up
1:01:27
getting caught by Morgan there's definitely an opportunity for Morgan to trade well with him so he's going to be staying in range mode for the majority
1:01:34
of this laning phase already doing a pretty good job of it now this is the matchup I'm most excited about because UK's returned to Korea right he's
1:01:41
playing his iconic Victor he's playing it closer he has the range Advantage here in this matchup and let's see how many advantages he can get early cuz I I
1:01:48
mentioned before despite being on a losing team in the LPL his Lane stats were pretty incredible and so far
1:01:53
putting that pressure on his Rich yeah doing some great trading here yep to the skies um but not really going to be
1:02:00
doing too much here I imagine that Morgan isn't too phased about how this one is going and having a peak in
1:02:06
towards top side of the map everything very very even so like he was saying yeah Rich trading well so far in the early game you'd expect that jce should
1:02:13
be able to have some Lane control I think that he probably wants to be able to get more than this right get zoning happening um make sure that Morgan is as
1:02:20
far on the back foot as he possibly can get it that's kind of the point of Jace when you normally pick Jace just want to Zone your opponent out play very
1:02:27
aggressively he went for grasp as well so he's trying to stack those up consistently and you see he's gotten a
1:02:32
ton of them already there's one more right there and is even gone for demolish here and will be able to get
1:02:37
that proc so really a lot of pressure for someone who's so known for laning across his career across multiple
1:02:45
titles bit of a positional uh scary moment here for ucal with hok so nearby
1:02:52
yeah well he's going to drive on through see whether he can get a flash oh man I think Uka didn't even think that he was going to go quite that far but that
1:02:59
gravity field just beautiful going to be able to hold huk in place UK loses a whole bunch of Health but not his flash
1:03:05
yeah that was critical he doesn't lose the flash but is going to give closer a ton of stability in the lane that was
1:03:12
otherwise starting to get really frustrating to play out do see the back completes for hype will grab grab a call
1:03:18
and head straight back to the Top Lane Paulo meanwhile just trying to get as much experience as he can completely
1:03:24
zoned out at the moment yep a little bit cheeky you could imagine but this wave state is uh pretty dire as closer is
1:03:30
going to get a decent chunk of damage on UK under the turret and is y so is always fine just rebinds the soul
1:03:36
everything's K Morgan continuing to get harassed as hype does turn back up here towards the top side to try and repair
1:03:42
what the heck's going on here and sponge in the area but hasn't actually gone for anything just yet and of course Feats of
1:03:49
Strength going to be what we're going to be talking about a fair bit today and first blood still going to be an option
1:03:55
here on this patch is now hok making his way down towards the bottom side as well rich in a little bit of trouble as Morgan trying to find some of these qes
1:04:01
doesn't quite get there though and hok at level four not going to be able to do too much throws a rock um that's more in
1:04:07
frustration than anything else looks like rich is going to go back home TP back down yeah it's really cool to see how much of an impact hbox already made
1:04:13
in this early game know bailing out uh two lanes that were struggling a little bit in terms of you know the melee
1:04:19
versus ranged aspect of their early levels and uh you know you think about hok as a player who like Los before him
1:04:26
who joined the LSK last year someone who gets a lot of kills early has a lot of action is super high impact for getting
1:04:32
his team leads but this case really just kind of patching some holes here making a big impact twice with some really nice
1:04:38
ease to come through good start here for bro um all
1:04:43
things considered with the draft and they're just going to look to build up this Misfortune and their front line so
1:04:49
any small disadvantage they have in the Top Lane you know is not going to matter necessarily all too much let's see what
1:04:55
sponge get done here is going to have to try and his way out of course fermacross stacked up but not actually opted into
1:05:01
here as po making his way down H deciding that he doesn't really want to get too aggressive as Polo also going to
1:05:07
uh act the same way he gets himself out of there as it looks like Grub's going to be on the table here for DRX they try
1:05:13
and grab those you can feel that first Blood Weighing on both of these teams not wanting to give this up and you know
1:05:20
closer doesn't have ult anymore because he used it to escape so this is a really tough fight here for bro no ult for pao
1:05:25
of course at level four either yeah CL are moving in Morgan there as well level six available he can go all out if he
1:05:30
would like it as it seems like bro should be able to get themselves one of these they've taken control of the area
1:05:37
at least for now so no feat of strength to go down for either team great double knock back here from Morgan is now
1:05:42
riched to the skies trying to throw closer around the gravity field is extraordinary and Polo is going to go
1:05:48
down for First Blood that's lazy field picking up first blad in his first game but it's traded back immediately the
1:05:55
Bros do not waste any time as Morgan is looking for rich as well grabs his opposite number and now lazy feel and
1:06:01
ukuk they have to just get out of there closer a bit distracted by minions as we can see as Morgan wanting to dash after
1:06:08
this little Cory but the valkyrie does come in and closer almost just straight up dies going to be out to get himself out Atlas you can already sort of start
1:06:14
to feel some of the problems of this composition here for DRX in terms of the tanky front line they index so heavily
1:06:21
into killing hok on the scarner and unsuccessfully uh in their trying end up
1:06:26
losing out more than they get with that first blood for lazy field so they walk away with that be of strength which you can see next to the game timer there to
1:06:33
the top Center of your screen if you want to track that but ultimately the fight goes the way of ERX here and you
1:06:39
can see look at these low health bars Spong is super low right and then you see the gravity well come through looks
1:06:44
really good here for DRX but lazy field uses his Valkyrie is now completely isolated he wants to kill hok here but
1:06:50
he's just too tanky he'll take sponge out on his way over and rich just can't get through this Cass
1:06:56
he will fall as well so a ton of gold going over to the Bros yeah that was uh
1:07:01
that was a bit of a gimme there as far as huk was concerned Rich really getting baited in as this is exactly what we
1:07:08
were talking about now Morgan is 2011 and we already said that if the game was even in more of like an even
1:07:15
game State this Cante would be quite happy moving into a mid and a late game well it's kind of now donez though uh
1:07:22
for for Mr Jace in a side lane even though he is ahead by a bit of farm these couple of kills going to make it
1:07:28
so that it's almost impossible to take him down there another crash into the wall here as sponge just told to leave the vicinity Dragon still leash as hyp
1:07:36
was over here positioning there from Pao as well Atlas just knowing that he could cut
1:07:41
anybody off here having banana brush control with that uh control super helpful there and just denying any entry
1:07:48
so you know sure you got the first of strength but Rich you can already see the problems here yeah LAN
1:07:56
very very quickly going to have that ultimate back up and available but rich not going to keep him interested for
1:08:01
that long and so now Morgan with that R button ready I think uh yeah if uh Rich
1:08:07
steps too far forward he is just dead especially with no flash dangerous times ahead here for the
1:08:13
new top laner for DRX and the returning legend that is Rich towards his top side great double up there from
1:08:19
hype yeah hype sitting on a Cole as well with a 270 gold lead right now uh once
1:08:24
that's finished that will compound upon itself as long as nothing goes wrong here so gets another double up yeah that
1:08:30
is massive actually down to 50% health is lazy F still going to be able to uh take that hot rod car uh SL um plane
1:08:38
underneath the turret always reminds me of like a hot rod like car thing but it is a plane of course um UK is going to
1:08:45
be just farming things up here as Rich moving over towards Morgan playing around some Vision I think Morgan knows
1:08:51
that he has a fair bit of strength here in this Lane still has to play it carefully given the melee into arranged matchup nature of things yeah you can
1:08:58
see the gold Leads Here across the board not looking great for DRX but specifically this Top Lane match up was
1:09:04
just so tough Rich trying to Greed for any auto he can get even used his acceleration gate just for positioning
1:09:10
there not going to go for an accelera shock blast yeah and I mean it's not
1:09:15
over right it's not doomed the Victor is going to scale really well damage wise corki will still have his two item spikes later but it's now for DRX a
1:09:22
really tough pick your battle type situ ation where you're already down a dragon
1:09:27
and you do not want to be giving any additional gold over here Misfortune to pick up any of those kills fortunately
1:09:33
for them so hype is not massively ahead but he's basically you know a kill up right now with all those assists and
1:09:38
that Co is going to be a big problem later on Dior really need to make sure they can find the right fights to take
1:09:43
here with their single Target CC look for punishing fights rather than just aggressive 4 V4 5 v5s yeah great vision
1:09:50
control here from Paulo spots out the fact that DRX was setting up for a little bit of something um and the 30 CS
1:09:56
gap for hype is actually the most gigantic and of course Misfortune fantastic laner just in general but now
1:10:01
bro looking to try and get another one as far as these objectives are concerned
1:10:06
if they get all three of these then that is going to be another Fe of strength or at least a third of it and that will put them at 2/3 only one more to be picked
1:10:13
up they will have that one on lock down and then it is just that first turret blood to be fought for for both of these
1:10:19
teams DX the fact that they managed to get at least that first blood was so big it feels to me like it's holding them in
1:10:25
this game um even if it isn't necessarily the be all end all we have seen it be so incredibly powerful you're
1:10:31
able to unlock those cool shoes especially when we consider the dragon spawning in 2 minutes that's going to be really difficult for them to fight for
1:10:37
because lazy field is just really not quite in this game he got the first Blood he was the hero there but you know
1:10:43
in doing so put himself In Harm's Way and they lost that big fight lost the followup fight and uh you know for
1:10:49
objectives here you you can see how frustrating it is for Rich to play out this Lane again youal in danger yeah
1:10:57
flashes forward going to be able to pick up oh the UL just goes completely wide the impale holds him out of the way but
1:11:03
still he's able to grab the kill onto UK cha storm not doing too much in Andel I'm sorry buddy wrong place wrong time
1:11:09
and you are just more food for the Y it looked comical but the results they're just fine hok making another big play
1:11:17
here it's time with his teammates set up together even though there was some anti Synergy there with theale he could have
1:11:23
just stopped you know um but still it was it was very funny and didn't actually matter I mean this is going to
1:11:29
lead to a ton of turret plate gold going over to closer as well as some additional damage for a potential first
1:11:35
turret to go over here they already have four grubs you can see how much of an impact that's making sponge kind of
1:11:40
greeting over here for these kugs will be denied as well so really just nothing coming up DRX way in this game the
1:11:48
Blackfire torch picked up for ukala as well at this point isn't really going to be a big spike as tombach in the brush
1:11:53
here andil coming over to try to Shadow so he can get back to Lane but he's not unfortunately going to be able to up absolutely amazing performance there
1:12:01
from Polo kind of saving what was a weird play um for the from the other two grabs that double stun on the shattering
1:12:07
strike and a gorgeous magnet storm and yeah they are they are out of options here as far as DRX is concerned so much
1:12:13
Vision there towards the top side and the Flash engage from hok as well just gives you such little time to react as
1:12:18
UK in this situation by the time he sees the the Scorpion it's too
1:12:23
late and I mean we're looking at a gold lead here as you can see in the gold difference over time that is starting to
1:12:30
really balloon quite quickly and like I said and like you mentioned that dragon
1:12:36
is up in 10 seconds here and if the DX do not deny it that is going to be those
1:12:41
uh that first beat going over yep and bro like we mentioned already only need one more of those and they are going to
1:12:47
be sorted dragon has spawned that's hextech Drake see what soul is going to be immediately afterwards but right now
1:12:54
h is trying to take control of the area Andel be able to sweep things out they get word the fact that that Leona is in
1:13:02
the area and closer has started this one up they are on Vision but I don't know whether this
1:13:07
dragon is going to last long enough for that Vision to mean anything at all UK moves over they get rid of that control
1:13:13
Ward but that is going to be a feet of strength going over to the Bros in the form of these objectives just the turrets to be worried about here as rich
1:13:20
is on the top side of the map definitely dangerous if he does get some spare time that is going to be the mountain Soul
1:13:27
coming up in 5 minutes time they can start fighting for first Mountain Drake Mountain soul with this Cante scar in
1:13:34
her front line deal with Rich who's going for a pretty unique build by the way uh a plated steel caps isn't that
1:13:40
weird but I was watching odam play this like tank Jace thing and it looked
1:13:45
really dumb I've seen it in Solo q a little bit and it's it's really difficult to kill the Jace often times
1:13:50
he went grasp as well you know and he's going to be quite tanky but it just doesn't help you kill Misfortune or the
1:13:58
tank front lines that you still have to deal with so it really puts a lot of the Otis on on ucal in this game who's 1.2
1:14:05
th000 behind and lazy fi who's still so far away from even completing his tier at this point here at 15 minutes sitting
1:14:11
at 138 Stacks has his Triforce at least but so much damage has to be put into
1:14:17
that Misfortune if they can take her out the front to back team fights definitely are possible here in the late game but
1:14:22
they're just so far behind it's hard to imagine a late game where they're not just completely bowled over yeah well
1:14:29
first Rift Herald is up and available don't have adakan just yet you can see he's going to be on the Northern side of
1:14:34
the rift and that is because that's where all the The Kills happen yes um
1:14:40
sometimes it's going to be hard to try and exactly work out um where adakan is going to be spawning um but this time it
1:14:46
was very easy huk looking for an opportunity here as andel's in trouble the ulti goes wide there from sponge and
1:14:51
he looks to try and get out of the way PO with magn storm doesn't get too much dump but that impale was brilliant at
1:14:56
holding them in place solar play going to be connecting and look at the health bar they are just way too big bro just
1:15:03
walk at them like a freight train and DRX can do nothing yeah there's just no damage DRX wanted to play around tops
1:15:08
side to deny that turret take because they wanted to to see if bro were going to come over here look for an aggressive play there and actually look to complete
1:15:14
their Feats of Strength but there's just not enough damage to get through those health bars it's a good followup engage
1:15:20
there from poo as well and now bro looking to clean this turret off the map look at how well they control mid lane
1:15:26
they also have Morgan sitting on the bottom side who had teleport available the entire time could have joined didn't need to and so that's the first turret
1:15:32
going over that speeds the strength here the first one of the LC Cup going over to bro yeah bro going to be the very
1:15:38
first ones to be able to buy cool shoes and I think that is absolutely fantastic they've been saving for it and that
1:15:44
suits them um because of the okay savings B so there you go yeah do we just miss a uh a a pedal as well on the
1:15:52
ground I think so shouldn't miss those that's that's not how things should be done we're going to have look at this again a calade of AR yeah it doesn't
1:15:59
really help that sponge misses his ultimate and maybe they could have at least turn this into a better situation
1:16:04
here but I don't think this is ever going to be a good situation for them with the you know the numbers disadvantage they have the tanky health
1:16:09
bars Etc uh you know we can say sponge missed that technically is true but I don't think it was really the main
1:16:15
reason why bro found success there H also missed um and I think there are a
1:16:21
few other misses there there some the main one is that huk didn't missed and managed to impale a couple of people and
1:16:27
there were just too many large bodies here on the side of bro to avoid being taken out so DX really going to have to
1:16:33
dig deep to try and find any opportunities here a minute and a half on the dragon and 2 and a half minutes
1:16:39
before arakan does turn up Morgan in position for that one and just going to be shoving this wave out make sure they
1:16:45
keep as much pressure onto DRX as possible is so frustrating as well here you know rich just walking over a
1:16:52
trinket he's like I want to come up here safely hopefully no one will annoy me on my way over right Morgan's already here
1:16:58
to get him and uh he can offer some damage back as you could see but it's
1:17:03
it's meager and the problem for this Jace is that he doesn't do a lot of
1:17:09
damage because of his build so even if he does hit a shock blast on the hype at long range because he has that one
1:17:14
perfect angle that I don't know if he's ever going to get but even if he does I just don't think hype really cares too
1:17:20
much about it oh de UK out taking a whole bunch of damage there are a couple of his friends around but they're not
1:17:25
really able to do too much here to the who just decides that he's going to be safe while he trades with you little bit
1:17:33
unfair and lazy feeling hyp back into the mid lane I feel like we're getting a little bit of Calm before a lot of storm
1:17:40
that's going to be coming in very soon unless Morgan decides to go all out which he does rich in so much trouble
1:17:46
here The Dashing continues The Flash does have to come out that means that rich will be safe for the moment Top Lane is out of the picture and now
1:17:52
another fight breaking out around this Dragon pit UK moving in watch out for that chaos storm but there's the magnet
1:17:58
storm speaking of Storms and the better one is on the side of the pros double kill for hype and Morgan he's there
1:18:04
towards the top side he's just taking out inner turrets and there is a Teleport coming in from Rich to try and
1:18:10
save the situation but it's looking real doomed it really is uh I I have to say I
1:18:15
mean I think the symptoms that you and I saw on the draft are really rearing their head here but it's a massive lead on top of it all and now that third
1:18:22
Dragon here is available but I mean that's not even really the story of the game we're watching the Herold take out mid turret get an additional crash here
1:18:28
massive void Lings here means it's going to be the inner to go over as well I mean this game is all but over here I
1:18:33
mean it's a 7,000 gold lead sub 20 minutes yeah and I mean you look at the Gold uh where it is across the board and
1:18:41
you're really like trying to go well which one is the least bad you're like oh it's the it's the Jace who is going
1:18:47
tank into two tanks um that have Mountain Soul point so it's it's really
1:18:53
I'm not optimistic Watch Fight one more perspec set the
1:18:59
magm intoe ultimate there and then the impale comes
1:19:04
in as well absolutely no way for hype to really take damage at all um so they were guaranteed to get that kill
1:19:10
gloriously orchestrated there by po you love to see it and you know you also
1:19:15
love to see wolf and I'm sorry to interrupt but I really want to bring up something that uh we saw recently and it was the changes between like win rates
1:19:22
after the Feats of Strength have come in there's been a lot of people worried about snowballing and things like this
1:19:27
um and we were also concerned about it we would spent like an entire POG State talking about the fact that first blood
1:19:33
is such a weird one that's the only one DRX didn't get and this is still a mega snowball has crashed down here from Polo
1:19:39
and the stats say as well that win rates haven't necessarily changed as far as a lot of things are concerned so it's it's
1:19:45
really weird how a lot of these stats do pan out but I think it's still a good thing to address regardless maybe we got
1:19:52
a little bit OV excited yeah I I wonder what the it is raous that's going to be the main flavor in L I was just trying
1:19:57
oton is Red by the way um that's just that's that's people tell me that there is a different one um that they see
1:20:03
sometimes in their games no no no we only have the red one here it's uh I I went for Two Plus cuz I I wanted to just
1:20:08
be a dissenting opinion I think well we'll have some crazy games here in the but this is definitely not one um yeah I
1:20:15
by the way I said two but like the one said three so that's why it says two plus and I'm right if it's three or four or whatever but uh I don't think that's
1:20:21
going to happen you're just trying to get more of the potential pull of possib but going back going back to that win
1:20:26
rate thing as all never mind let's let's talk about this all right hug is just trying to run forward and then get hit by a hammer that is sometimes AG G I
1:20:33
wanted to I wanted to say I wonder if we have any stats about like what the gold differences are at 15 was that one on
1:20:39
the cuz uh yeah the gold difference at 20 was about 7K here and you can see DRX
1:20:44
are really just I mean they are trying to get will they be out there are four
1:20:50
people on their way over and he is losing Health slowly but surely yeah this is going to be taken down so lazy field grabs his second okay as zakan
1:20:57
continuing to get a little bit frustrated here towards the top side of the map I don't know whether either of these players are going to be Sol it
1:21:03
anytime soon though so with huk off the map maybe some space here to be bought for DRX yeah it could be I mean it's
1:21:09
certainly going to be um a little reprieve some additional gold going over the lazy F he's really far behind on his
1:21:16
tier Stacks you know he got that uh you know manamune a long time ago but uh you
1:21:22
know he's he's still stacking so it's going to be fully the spike he's looking for it'll help to at least have the completed item but not as much as he's
1:21:29
hoping for there a long way away from that LeAndre for UK as well those are two spikes that could give DRX a
1:21:35
fighting chance of getting through that front line and because it's definitely not going to be rich who's doing it CU
1:21:40
his fimble vent now completed that's not normally what Jace builds a tier into but uh it is now I guess yep it is sort
1:21:47
of the flavor of the month as far as Jace is concerned the fact that like everything's just kind of like let's
1:21:52
build tank stuff just makes me a bit sad but I'm going to do my very best to ignore it and remember he's still got a
1:21:58
gun so he's still going to try and do damage sure um even if it's not necessarily going to do quite as much I
1:22:03
mean when we go back to the draft too I mean there were a lot of things they could have banned like they decided not
1:22:09
to ban the scarner which has been a huge problem from this game 7 out of 8 KP here it's hok so I want to give him
1:22:15
credit but scarner is also just so incredibly powerful can move around the map so quickly and has made such a big impact in these team fights and yeah
1:22:22
andle is dead guys um oh he's going to flash still probably dead but he's going
1:22:27
to try and do what he can before he does end up going down and when I say still dead he is not it's a double impale it's the other members of his team that are
1:22:34
going to be going down UK the first one to hit the deck as lazy field turns up and it looks like bro just going to back
1:22:40
away and say thanks for your mid laner well now Rich could be in trouble Morgan looking for an opportunity not wanting
1:22:45
to press the R button just yet yeah not quite and you know UK was closer than to
1:22:52
the LeAndre than I thought he has that done now and you can see the damage coming through from lazy field it's not
1:22:57
you know that there's no way to get through these tanks it's just not Jace that's going to do it bro need to be
1:23:02
careful about really just kind of overextending and and saying hey like this game is done we win this for sure
1:23:09
need to be a little bit more careful about how they take some of these fights I get it 7,000 gold up but uh some
1:23:14
caution should be taken they still win that fight they still get the kill on UK they still going to get Aon but if this
1:23:19
was more even game te might have been bit of a disaster yep and Aon is going to be Tak out here cool little buff now
1:23:26
around the Bros see what they can actually utilize with it there some Bounty gold going in here as Rich
1:23:32
finally manages to take that outer turret but this is the dire situation that they're in right 7,000 gold
1:23:38
difference bounties are up you've got a mountain Soul that's imminent here the Drake is in fact live and bro have some
1:23:46
extra lives to work with now yeah it means that they can heavily commit to a
1:23:52
dive going back to this situation here andil is the first Target eats a ton of damage actually handles that Zen flash
1:23:58
really well to buy himself some time here to get out and you can see UK is like okay I got to come over here and get some damage done nope you stepped
1:24:04
way too far across the line and you were going to get punished into all of this AOE he's the only one who gets taken out
1:24:12
but uh still a huge win here for bro it allows them to take oton which now gives them their withdraw as what I like to
1:24:18
call it cuz that's what it says over their heads in English um where if they die they give a little bit of gold they give a pedal but they just instantly you
1:24:24
can heavily all in on an objective like a baron for example exactly and so now
1:24:29
the Bros going to get it down to 50% health and I think that you know sponge is trying to make his way in Polo is going to hold him in position andle's in
1:24:35
trouble once again Eclipse doing so much work I just don't know whether it's doing quite enough as now close to going
1:24:42
back and yeah he's just going to pretty much recall and then head back in doesn't have teleport though so he's
1:24:47
going to be a little while making his way over a four versus five just for a bit as the magnet storm is gorgeous with
1:24:53
the bullet time over the top crash in from hok there as well finds an impale onto lazy field who cleanses Valkyries
1:25:00
does everything he can to get himself out of the way and this time finally handle is going to go down Morgan is just going completely ballistic here
1:25:06
towards the top side of the map flashes out of the gravity well another kill onto ucal the the Lord is definitely
1:25:14
Almighty in his first game of the lck cup they're going to take down sponge as well and it's only lazy field left
1:25:21
standing yes they stopped the baron but I don't know whether they're going to stop Dr it again last man on the lineup
1:25:26
today last one to fall and down he goes makes it an Ace
1:25:33
and uh look if you're uh cup half full uh-huh you know successful Baron deny
1:25:39
and also if you're full they can't play sconner again in the next game that's
1:25:44
right nor can they play the real Misfortune combo uh-huh they may not have banned it but they banned it you
1:25:50
know cuz this is fearless it's glorious um X just uh just wanting to get him in
1:25:56
the second one um but let's have a look at this fight one more time sacrifices himself early but honestly they their
1:26:02
wallets are heavy World their wallets are heavy and I don't think you play this fight out this way if it's even game State at all but they have the res
1:26:09
they have control over the baron pit to a certain extent and they're like yeah well I mean we could basically do Baron
1:26:15
and overextend and win a team fight all at the same time look at the damage coming through here even though rich is
1:26:20
very tanky and sponge is Sani it's enough damage here that they wear through it no one is threatening hype like sponge is like trying to play him
1:26:27
he's like oh maybe I can do something back no you can't and there's just not enough damage lazy feels so far behind
1:26:32
he's able to get a withdraw but that is it and Morgan is just he doesn't care if he dies or not because he's got that res
1:26:39
and he's gante lazy Feld lives for a really long time here but there going to be the baron taken regardless as you can
1:26:45
see now in live look at the glowing portrait looking really cool on this current UI for 2025 always making
1:26:52
updates the ltk and you love to see it um bro also making updates 2025 their
1:26:57
changes have been more winning if they manag to win this game then they have never lost for the entirety of an lck
1:27:04
cup ever 100% win rate I know isn't it extraordinary they're going to be able to grab themselves a mountain sold that
1:27:09
is 100% Soul rate as well 100% Barons in every game that they've taken since
1:27:14
elimination matches in KES cup they haven't lost exactly and they' have taken more aans in other than any other
1:27:21
team ever in l history exactly it is extraordinary that's extraordinary as
1:27:28
well the impale comes through the bullet time comes down and yeah we're being a bit fous we're having a bit of fun because ladies and gentlemen this game
1:27:34
is over closer diving on forward Polo once again showing off the fact that he
1:27:39
is going to get player of the match that is just how it's going to go his Rel has been so extraordinarily good and DRX
1:27:46
just going to be happy that he can't play it again in game number two sponge going to get wiped from the rift andle onto the fountain but uh Morgan's going
1:27:53
to do his very best to pulling back out there and we're not going to be able to talk about respawning Nexus turrets because unfortunately the Nexus does not
1:28:00
respawn and that will be going down imminently okay Savings Bank Brion with
1:28:05
the very first Victory here for our lck cup putting themselves 1er in the series
1:28:10
this is the kind of game for all those out there who are like oh man this new patch is pretty snowbally you might be
1:28:16
saying well I told you so but I don't think it was really about the the rift as much is it was about a really strong
1:28:24
early game and some big draft problems on the side of DRX especially lazy field falling behind you mentioned it 30 CS
1:28:30
behind I didn't even notice it right at the beginning how far behind he had really Fallen but he fell so far behind he was relatively irrelevant and then
1:28:37
they targeted UK so heavily it was hak who shut him down several times so he couldn't really Sid Lane they were like
1:28:43
okay one carry down second carry down no one kills the front line we can do whatever we want some of those fights
1:28:48
are bro little bit lacad a little bit halfhazard a little bit kind of H we win it doesn't matter a little bit sloppy
1:28:55
but when you're that far ahead it really just doesn't matter especially when you got the Bly boys in the Cante and the
1:29:01
scanner so I think we're pretty happy that we're not going to be seeing them again in the next game but this girl she knows exactly what's up because Paul was
1:29:08
absolutely extraordinary in that game and I think that hype joining this team
1:29:13
even though he is just on loan from KT him and Paul working together is really
1:29:19
demonstrating to everyone how good Polly was because we knew that hype very hyped up you know it's a bit on the nose but
1:29:24
that's just how it was he was so good in Challenger KT last year were amazing and uh yeah as you can see it doesn't really
1:29:31
disappoint 2.7k but of course he was the solo damage dealer pretty much outside of closer who didn't really find as many
1:29:38
of the fights as he wanted to for the bullet times the setups for the magnet storms just glorious it's so Li limited
1:29:43
data but still I mean he looks so much more comfortable than he did with Envy for sure it seems like it's a massive
1:29:48
upgrade yeah I would agree but now it is time for us to take a short break we'll hear from what the space has to say
1:29:53
about that game and then we'll be getting into game number two imminently see you soon

k fly those bro Flags proudly in the chat
1:36:57
if you subscribed already they are still undefeated in 20125 after the first game
1:37:03
of the season they go up 1-0 against DRX and one away from winning the series
1:37:09
welcome back to the space Deon alongside chronicler and ox and guys before we
1:37:14
jump into all the highlights we had that quick announcement that we were told right before the game history made here
1:37:20
in the lck yes lazy feel the first Vietnamese player to play in
1:37:27
the lck on an lck team a huge huge moment there for him uh and the fans
1:37:34
were huge about it across all of social media here are some of the comments from
1:37:39
the lck Vietnam page and what it means to them to have a player represented and we already have the casting represented
1:37:46
as well huge huge moment it's also an interesting one because you know bro has Morgan and Morgan actually has a ton of
1:37:51
fans uh in Vietnam cuz uh some touring he did there so it ended up being like you know you want to support your
1:37:57
Vietnamese player but also Morgan is normally who they look to support yeah one of my favorite content of last year
1:38:02
was showmaker who just took Lucid under his wing and they were just drinking Vietnam having a great time uh for the
1:38:09
same reason ton of fence there so that was really cool to see and lazy Field playing today is a is a really big deal
1:38:15
historically it is but that was about all the good feel that you got if you were a DRX fan because most if not all
1:38:22
of this game other than First Blood was bro let's take a look at some of the highlights here starting off with hbox
1:38:29
early pathing here to in uh to uh impact the game yeah and you know we talked a
1:38:34
lot about hanack we talked a lot about the scarner being hugely prioritized in LPL CK C and you can kind of see why
1:38:41
even though he doesn't get a killer even a flash here we saw a situation where he just gets a little bit of Lan pressure
1:38:47
allows the Y to Crash by taking a lot of Health paths down towards bot to pick up the kog so pretty efficient with his
1:38:53
time in and then looks to do a similar thing bot Lane and it's just that early impact of assisting your Lan is getting
1:38:58
that early pressure it's also just a really clean paing right because he's not wasting any time while this is
1:39:04
happening like only his uh Raptors are up top side is still respawning so he's not wasting any time he's setting up his
1:39:10
lanes for success and it's this level of aggression that hambach has always shown
1:39:15
and also if you go back to when bro was at his most successful it was when umpty had exactly games like this and could
1:39:21
take the rest of his team on his back the timing was so good cuz mid lane he helped the Y get the crash and then bot
1:39:27
Lane was when the wave was in a bad spot for the Jace where he wants to get the crash and kind of eliminate that happening and just little things like
1:39:33
this can make such a difference especially when you have this early game driven meta right and speaking of that early game driven meta that led to the
1:39:39
grub fight at 6 minutes which is still very early and all those plays made a huge impact and we talk talk a little
1:39:46
bit about the actual fight but it's more so when is the last time you remember seeing a 5v5 grub fight and a really big
1:39:52
thing here is that even though lafield does get first blood which uh he can put that one uh on his uh on his trophy
1:39:59
mantle what is really telling here is already this is what we hoped for this is what the idea fits of staring is is
1:40:05
that people are incentivized to actually fight because I can tell you after like last ofk every single grub spawn was
1:40:13
just answered by dragon and then maybe you contest a second round or you like you try to steal one away but actual
1:40:18
fights for an objective this early on I think is hopefully something that we're going to see more of because that's what
1:40:24
we want right we want action and after that it was a triple kill there for Bros
1:40:30
they basically took control of most of the game thanks to are we calling him head hunter huk are we going with uh
1:40:38
Hannibal huk all right we we'll keep working it find this to our last
1:40:44
highlight here 25 minutes in the team fight and you can see the combo between the bot Lane of the Bros and the
1:40:49
important thing to talk about here is vicious adakan has been taken so immediately bro start of the baron cuz
1:40:55
they want the fight and you kind of see here you know considering how far ahead they are the trading in this fight isn't
1:41:01
like excellent but they just don't care it's like they have the reset buff you know people go down they just teleport
1:41:06
back to base see the scarner just flying back and it's like okay well we got what we wanted the the payoff for the other
1:41:13
team is very small we're not giving over shutdowns we not even giving over much gold uh and really it just shows the
1:41:18
power of this buff once you secure it it's so telling as well cuz you can see that that bro does care about dying
1:41:24
normally in team fights there's a bit of an EB and flow as you like you use your cool Downs you back off so you don't go
1:41:29
down in there they just like nope we are sending it because even if they do end up getting uh taking a bit of an
1:41:35
unfavorable TR it doesn't matter because of the respawn the tempo lead that you're going to be able to get is always going to kind of offset and uh uh
1:41:43
unsurprisingly uh we are currently at zero angry out of con we're going to keep this running this is not the F the
1:41:50
last we're going to see of this uh because we have zero one or two or more
1:41:56
uh free camps running at the moment and uh far it's early it's early we'll see
1:42:02
it's early for us two two or more preds for those who aren't completely familiar it's how blood thirsty the game is and
1:42:08
it seems like it has to be pretty bloodthirsty to get the ruinous one uh and lck not the most bloodthirsty region
1:42:14
as well let's take a look at the draft here because again one of the changes with lck cup and the first third of the
1:42:19
season is full Fearless draft as now these 10 Champions will not be played
1:42:26
they won't be played including the bands as well yeah and some of them are some really high pry picks I think for me what stood out is the scarner cuz I
1:42:33
honestly ultimately think if the game went even or if DRX got the feat of strength you into your full ad team the
1:42:39
improved ninja Tabby with the physical damage Shield could have been huge but this scar it like there's a reason it's been PMA band in the LPL handback is
1:42:46
well piling it you could see that early impact he had and it felt like they kind of run away with the game so you know the problems are kind of solved by feish
1:42:52
you want have to deal with it again but I think ensuring handback is on a strong H jungle who can impact the game early
1:42:59
is going to be really important and with this the only tank jungler that has been meta and will still be open is maai
1:43:05
right who definitely has fallen pretty high on the prior list so we'll see if already gets banned and again as a
1:43:10
reminder because none of these Champs can get played we won't see Cante till at least the next series which I know
1:43:17
winning is is always a big deal and yeah I want to Echo what Ox was saying uh particularly with that Victor which I I
1:43:23
think we saw glimpses of could be a good moment but I don't know do you think thex is going to bring it back I don't
1:43:29
know hopefully it'll be more than just a feel good story for lazy feel and the
1:43:34
rest of DRX but Hero hok has a thing to say about it and we got a couple guys that have a couple things to say about
1:43:40
it let's send it on over to the casters to get into game number two heck yeah Deon thank you so much uh
1:43:48
guys for the breakdown and yeah I don't think like I think that adakan only has
1:43:53
has one form I think it's akan Khan the whole time that's uh that's all we're going to get that's how it's going to go
1:43:59
um that is you know I put my money where my mouth was there uh I I bet that it was going to be zero throughout the
1:44:05
entire season um went a little bit Ham on that one and so you're on the two plus Camp look I want to make it clear I
1:44:11
said two but no one said three right so they put me in two plus like I was it sounds like I was like yeah I think
1:44:17
it'll be like five but uh I thought maybe two would sneak in but after watching that game hard to say we might
1:44:23
have games that are more competitive where you know drags a little bit down into the mud in terms of Team fighting
1:44:28
constantly but it it doesn't look likely at this point that it's going to be a common thing valdis was the first one to
1:44:33
call it very early on during the uh opening event he was like mm I don't think we're ever going to see it and
1:44:40
that was of course echoed we didn't see it a single time in Challengers leading up until this moment as well so haven't
1:44:46
seen it in the LPL either um but that was only from what I watched they didn't watch all of it um but we just have to
1:44:53
see if you don't see the L it's like yeah I know that's what I'm thinking I'm like if you don't see the although the I
1:44:58
watched the what was it the fpx versus RNG series and it just there was it was a bit residence sleeper it was a little
1:45:05
bit on the bed side of things it was not uh the most uh exciting and hyped up LP
1:45:10
match that I've ever seen in my life I've seen a few of them and I imagine that they can do better so we'll have to see what is going to happen here and uh
1:45:16
we'll see what happens here in the lck cup as well whether maybe the Bros find a little bit more of a bloodthirsty
1:45:21
composition and awaken that ruinous Aon this time around I think we'll see
1:45:28
obviously we have Fearless drafts we'll see completely different comps and different Champions but I think we'll probably see a more competitive draft
1:45:33
this time around you have to hope so because DX's draft definitely left us very wanting uh and beyond that with
1:45:40
Fearless fan yeah we've got a lot of them we've got a whole lot of them across the world um but with Fearless
1:45:47
draft drafting gets even harder it gets even more challenging your Champion pools are tested even further so what
1:45:54
DRX has planned here what they have in mind moving on the blue side and something we've all got our eyes on here
1:46:01
try to bring this to a three- game series yep and try and get lazy f a win in his first series as well of course
1:46:07
the Bros currently undefeated in the lck cup we'll see whether they stay that way after this game number two or whether
1:46:12
it's going to go all the way as you can see towards the top left and top right no teams can play any of these 10
1:46:18
Champions that you can see at the top there so the bands not likely to change too much but we'll see exactly how it is
1:46:25
going to go as the AIA and nocturn going to be taken away first up well what happens often time in Fearless is picks
1:46:32
that are already high priority shoot up even higher like I don't think you can give Aurora away in this particular case
1:46:38
I think we'll likely see um The Ash taken away the kalista taken away as well maybe not necessarily on that final
1:46:45
blue side slot they might want to put lazy feel on the pick he's not known for it it's not one of his picks he's most
1:46:52
famous for anything like that but we'll see what ends up coming through V also very popular right now kind of the
1:46:58
second most popular next to scarner in this meta yep that was uh the second Champion that Faker played in the
1:47:04
opening uh the season opening as well uh scanner and then VI so taking away the vi option means that we do not get to uh
1:47:12
see backto back Faker jungle Champions which I think is very important for everyone to know Baris is once again
1:47:18
going to be banned away of course bans do not carry over so if a champion is banned you can see ically play it if it
1:47:23
is not then banned once again uh next time around so the picks will always change the bands may not necessarily as
1:47:30
the Aurora is going to be left up and snapped up easiest Aurora lock in of UK's life um I mean it's it's pretty
1:47:38
straight forward here there's no knock turn but still incredibly powerful pick
1:47:43
and they even used some of that uh time to discuss what they want to do next but I don't think there was ever a World
1:47:49
while that wasn't going to get locked in closer's response on the other hand will get a little bit more interesting obviously his yon is gone some of the
1:47:55
other blind uh picks you know that we saw a lot of the time like the oxan are gone Rumble available as well as ambessa
1:48:01
so we may see a trade of those picks here in the top side and hok will pick up his vgo he's very well known for wuk
1:48:10
scared I mean wukong's one of those other picks right now that's very popular here in Korea we're seeing it a ton we have I've seen it not find
1:48:17
necessarily a massive amount of success um from what I've seen but we have certainly seen a resurgence in The
1:48:22
Monkey King and looks like sponge is going to continue considering it will it be locked in that's the question lots of
1:48:28
circles lots of AOE CC exactly that's it's got such great Synergy with Aurora's ultimate because you're kind of
1:48:35
locked into that Circle and then he's going to start spinning around and it's a nightmare to play through that team
1:48:40
fight scenario if you can't Zone the Aurora out of the fight I'm curious to see what closer's response will be
1:48:46
because there's a lot of picks you can try to get advantages into Aurora with uh especially in terms of trying to set
1:48:52
up for team fights like LeBlanc was quite popular in the past players like showmaker utilize that very well must be
1:48:58
a blind kaisa here I mentioned one oh I do like this from closer of
1:49:05
course Vigo and tia together have been very strong but it was you and I wolf that were watching closer just destroy
1:49:12
people on TIA in the Gasper cup of course it's been a few patches since then but uh Tia has remained pretty
1:49:19
strong yes definitely true all right or going to to be taken away here I want to set up any more
1:49:26
combos in that Circle yeah it's a bit of a Thunderdome situation I think yeah and
1:49:31
having the stable Top Lane when your jungler isn't going to come online very early whereas a vgo is going to be very
1:49:37
relevant early I think is a a pick that rich might have gone for here see if they want to ban like gragas on top of
1:49:44
that as well um would be a lot of magic damage but I think a reasonable Choice very popular Top Lane pick at the moment
1:49:51
yep and you know w does a fair bit of physical depends on how you build the Kaiser but often times she is mostly
1:49:57
magic damage these days but I think the physical variety still does some stuff yeah it's mixed you know yeah yeah
1:50:02
especially when you don't have like true tanks and things like this um I think it's kind of okay to step away from more
1:50:08
of that uh full Pokey build as ambessa is going to be banned away here Morgan
1:50:14
going to be respecting that one not wanted to go up against it as this Rumble although Rumble has had a decent
1:50:19
match up into her they have you know some decent pick potential here cait would have been a great choice into the
1:50:25
kaisa I was wondering if maybe we would see something like a jinx uh in this particular case for bro the obsession
1:50:32
with picking Zia into kaisa just makes me so sad but thank oh okay so it's still going to be the ran theoretically
1:50:39
hype doesn't have to play Kaiser but I am so worried that we're just going to see um zyan on the bottom side for the
1:50:46
Bros it's fairly safe to Blind the Recon because Leona is not available TR was played last game so so maybe just
1:50:53
keeping his options open a little bit here as Gallo is being considered this could mean Top Lane
1:50:59
Aurora yeah the poppy as well could be going into the support position as we know of course does do very well into
1:51:06
the uh raan okay well it's looking like that is what we are going to see we have seen poppy in Challengers quite a few
1:51:12
times it's been played support every time uh it's not been played anywhere else so that will continue to be the
1:51:18
case here and on the side of bro what's that ad carry going to be here you know
1:51:24
tough match ups in kaisa there's a lot of them the Z knew going is the standard
1:51:30
response and my Pro I have a lot of problems with this but one of my main issues is that Zia is very low range and
1:51:38
we'll need to follow up on like a tiia knockback by getting very close to a lot
1:51:43
of Danger let's say between Gallo's taunt uh which is going to be fantastic inside of the Aurora Circle um the
1:51:50
Wukong ultimate you know etc etc so you're always going to be vulnerable and you only have one ultimate so while in
1:51:57
isolation strong into the kaisa putting yourself at a lot of risk here DRX I think this time around getting the
1:52:03
stronger draft here so much pre-built Synergy here and ritually playing the Gallo top yeah the Gallo top kind of fun
1:52:09
into the rumble very good at anti-magic damage and uh that is precisely what
1:52:14
rumble's ammo has been of course Rumble pretty strong so still going to be able to navigate the lane but I think that
1:52:20
rich should be able to nullify it if the game goes go the way he wants to I feel like this time the shoe is on the other foot as far as how the Top Lane matchup
1:52:27
is going to play out and we'll see whether some extra attention can be brought by this Vigo uh from hok
1:52:33
definitely a lot more aggressive on the top side of the map for bro this time and so I think we're going to have to see a little bit more of that uh bro
1:52:40
activity uh in the early stages of the game I do agree I have to point out to
1:52:46
the blow it up new slogan for bro it's just perfect can we blow it up can we say bro it up well that's the whole
1:52:52
thing in Korean and it's PL oh right yeah because it's the same oh God it's so good all right well we'll see whether
1:52:59
they can bro it up or whether DRX is going to be showing up in this game number two that was that was not great
1:53:05
let's get into
1:53:15
[Music]
1:53:20
it all right here we are ladies gentlemen I promise no more bad jokes like that and and I I no that was a lie
1:53:27
I'm I'm not going to be able to make that promise I've made promises before and i' they've burnt me and so I am not
1:53:32
going to do that anymore man this draft for DRX seems so good it does seem
1:53:38
strong especially when you just look in the mid lane and you're like oh they got Aurora she is pretty powerful yeah that was the first thing that kind of caught
1:53:45
my eye but then all of the other circles that came along with it with top tier Champion PCH kind of really solidified
1:53:51
it a little bit um every time I see the skin that rich is going for here it always makes me shed a
1:53:57
tear for the BBQ Olivers oh me too every time um but yeah I mean when you
1:54:02
consider also how good kaisa is into Rumble specifically like if you can isolate Rumble and catch him um you know
1:54:08
unawares if you end up in that 1 V one scenario you can often just take him out especially if you're accelerated yeah not to mention like having the uh Killer
1:54:15
Instinct to get out of equalizers if they're thrown down as well Rumble of course fantastic into Less Mobile uh 0
1:54:22
carries you can buy a whole lot of space but uh I don't think I uh I don't want
1:54:28
to underestimate closer on this to because I feel like he can really make early games very difficult for his
1:54:34
opposition and I think that these lanes are definitely playable for bro as this game begins so I think a lot of eyes is
1:54:40
going to be on the mid jungle for bro here if they do want to make this a two and DRX just trying to get to some of
1:54:46
these team fights and if it is like it was last time around with you know fighting over every single grub Camp
1:54:51
it's going every single grub spawn that's going to be coming up that could be helping them out here as the flash from lazy field immediately comes up as
1:54:58
poo getting aggressive hype is still at full health po does have to flash away though and so it is two Summoner spells
1:55:05
for two it was both of Po's though hype still holds on to his yeah that's important that Pao or rather that hype
1:55:12
is going to have his flash very important um in these early stages went for barrier as well for some potential
1:55:18
follow-up trades here kaisa can be quite strong with her plasma Stacks ear ear and was putting the pressure onto Paulo
1:55:24
there who now doesn't have his flash but he's a very mobile champion in the Recon so feels like a slight trade up here for
1:55:30
bro yep sponge now moving towards top side as well humu same can be said for
1:55:36
him see whether they do actually pay attention to this Lane as bro do begin
1:55:41
to push things out see decent little Advantage being built up here after the one
1:55:47
trade as po was able to eat his potions and also use that gleaming quill to get that health but back up to a manageable
1:55:53
State hpe not really needing to use anything just yet sitting on a biscuit and a potion and level three comes
1:56:00
through as well so yeah this is looking a little bit D up BL call not quite going to do too much there so andle not
1:56:06
going to be snared or anything but you can see this poppy in the early game not really able to hold a candle
1:56:12
to unfortunately not uh if you are a DRX fan lazy field
1:56:19
also getting zoned out of some Farm there was able to get the last few CS there but finding himself already at a deficit and now in danger of hok diving
1:56:26
early the turret ramp is going to be quite important in this situation yeah lazy field thinking about where he wants
1:56:31
to go and honestly there's not a lot of options because he has no flash that's First Blood going over to the vgo gets
1:56:37
the possession there as well to try and get a little bit more damage onto this turret beautifully done and that is going to be bro now picking up that
1:56:42
first feeder strength once again huk just making such an early impact in the game even earlier than he did in the
1:56:47
previous one and unfortunately when you leave a kaisa that has no flash out to dry in a situation like that if she gets
1:56:54
knocked up she's got cleansed but that's useless y against Paul's knock up there so just guaranteed death against an
1:57:01
early game vgo sponge obviously you know at level four isn't going to be making the same sort of impact if he were there
1:57:06
maybe he could have made an impact but unfortunately not to be the case you can see on the mini map where mid lane is
1:57:13
set he's trying to get that bottom Scuttle but lazy field is just left all alone here without Flash can avoid the
1:57:19
knockup it's an easy First Blood here for hok a feet of strength on top of that gold precisely nowhere to go um for
1:57:27
lazy feel in that situation I think it was navigated beautifully there by Polo huk and
1:57:33
hype and so so far I'm not as upset about uh you know Z being picked up I
1:57:39
think it's working out relatively well here of course we see Z and Kaiser has been the agreement all the time as hok
1:57:45
he's trying to do it again and man like it's so cool that just last year we had
1:57:50
the Lucid debut and we were like damn this guy running challenges guys he be he's going to be so good and then he was
1:57:56
and huk coming into the lck OR at least the lck cup after dominating Challenger
1:58:01
once more and also having a uh a great game so far of course very early days
1:58:07
but I love to overreact I mean he's such a he's such a similar player to Lucid anyways we're going to have a bit of a
1:58:12
scuffle here yeah this time towards bottom side Ender with the flash slam into the wall on Apollo they are going
1:58:19
to be able to take him down th health on this Dragon the seismic shove from closer is just a little bit of a wave
1:58:25
goodbye and that is going to mean that objective goes over to uh DRX nicely
1:58:32
done they're going to be able to grab their first stack there still needing two more to grab a fet of strength but that is really going to take the wind
1:58:37
out of the sails here a bro yeah that was a really well timed uh engage there coming through from uh andil and this is
1:58:45
really going to help turn things around here as we see hok is trying to rush this first gr but finds himself in
1:58:51
danger he's in a lot of trouble here as Rich looking to make his way over not quite in taunt range and it is still
1:58:57
just going to be that one grub picked up by DRX so I actually thought that huk might have got the Smite off there but I
1:59:02
uh missa it and that was in fact that grub going over to this Wukong so that
1:59:08
could be two very very fast objectives to be taken here by DRX to even out the
1:59:13
Feats of Strength just needing one more in four minutes time when that Drake spawns or in 4 minutes when the next
1:59:19
round of grub spawns DX do have that opportunity is humog 50% Health still
1:59:24
and sponge right place right time to deny this fgo any more of this Farm you can see already two and a half camps
1:59:31
ahead and the Wukong really coming into his own and of course we know Wukong is this Champion that really does like like
1:59:38
to hit level six and he's not even level six yet and he's having a great time got the farm lead this hug has spent so much
1:59:44
time ganking these Lanes trying to make an impact there um ended up losing a bunch of time topside ukel yeah seis
1:59:50
shove is looking real good GR entrance coming down there as well from po as closer trying to throw out some of these
1:59:56
rocks in goes and although the heroic charge picks up the Buckler and everything is going to be absolutely fine so just mid support having a little
2:00:03
bit of a battle and UK holds on to the flash Cool C and collected we'll go back to this play here on the dragon On's
2:00:10
flash play as sponge goes in Pao unfortunately just too close to the edge
2:00:15
here gets jumped on and pushed into the wall and then they end up losing control of the dragon and I mean look when you
2:00:21
look at the gold leads here you know for bro they're they're quite meager on the Zia and okay hold
2:00:28
up another Taun to come through there from Rich does have that Aftershock so we can uh find some pretty good trading
2:00:34
patents here up against Morgan you can see so far it's working out okay yeah although Morgan does have pretty reliable wave flar as andle trying to
2:00:40
clear out Vision does so successfully you mentioned the uh you know how nice
2:00:46
it is to play Gall into the rumble very tanky very difficult to burn him down
2:00:51
see that kind of on display there as well um but you know those gold leads I was mentioning are kind of fading away
2:00:56
outside of uks here in the mid lane and sponge does have level six now
2:01:04
finally here yeah possible opportunity here is Andel he doesn't so cannot lay
2:01:10
down that ultimate try and hold them in place for this Wukong you can sort of
2:01:15
see in your mind's eye can't you how these team fights are going to be orchestrated I think a lot of it has to do with you know andle making these big
2:01:21
plays or adding that large amount of Separation to these fights to isolate a couple of key targets and then use all
2:01:27
of that AOE to destroy them or you can just use the keeper verdict to lock down a single Target then you have sponge
2:01:34
layer in these knockups rich jump in from on top block him down and then UK
2:01:39
puts a circle around him to make it real difficult to escape so it's uh it's very very cool uh how this composition could
2:01:45
theoretically work out I think they're going to have to continue on the E that they're currently on because DRX there's
2:01:51
going to need for me there needs to be more um to be shown after what we saw in game one it was not exactly the greatest
2:01:58
and bro right now just uh chilling out Dix losing some Farm here in the bottom Lane only a little bit but we'll lose
2:02:04
significantly more on the top side actually uh with this setup here kind of awkward for them lazy feel so late to
2:02:11
turn up to this Lane already 25 CS behind finds himself 200 gold behind as well was ahead earlier because of the
2:02:17
kill but oh the cannon that's that's that's something I mean that's so you can see that gold lead kind of wash away
2:02:23
a little bit um there that hype did in fact have still has but a bigger one
2:02:28
rich is going to be able to turn this into though a plate Morgan did not want to expend his teleport to come down here
2:02:34
and try to deny it so it's a still relatively close game here yeah and it's really going to be about these next few
2:02:40
team fights 45 seconds until the dragon but before that a second set of grubs I mean DRX already have three to get
2:02:46
further uh up to to 4 five would be huge for them and also potentially if they can get all three that Fe of strength
2:02:53
completed oh hyp gone very aggressive here lit on fire immediately and down to 50% Health means that this grub fight
2:03:00
could be very difficult and a possible feat of strength opportunity here for DRX if they were able to lock it down
2:03:05
all three of them the ability for huk just to steal away one is certainly going to be there five grubs though
2:03:11
going to lead to a possible first to but here's another engage great double knock up there from andle as huk tries to get
2:03:17
himself out but doesn't manage to Hype utilizing that blade caller real nicely but not quite nicely enough as in goes
2:03:24
closer his patented overly aggressive play coming on through there as he tries to flash away but he just takes a stick
2:03:31
to the head and that is going to be sponge locking down that kill and now Rich looking for some more damage to
2:03:37
this turret going to be able to grab another demolished proc grabbing some more plates and this could be another
2:03:43
speed of strength going over to DRX as the grubs going to get started it looks like it will be to even it up no one
2:03:48
here to deny hok on the other side of the map maybe trying to turn this into a dragon play but full control goes to UK
2:03:55
there in the Sid Lane so I'm not so sure he's going to be able to make that happen his situation is quite bizarre remember hype is very low on health is
2:04:02
actually starting to deal with the wave he's far away so isn't going to offer too much damage but it's really hok who gets punished you know we often jokingly
2:04:07
call him paper man here on the global side of things because he's just not that tanky on the Vigo and another great
2:04:13
engage from UK or sorry from andil and closer this is a very bizarre decision I mean hype's incredibly low there's it
2:04:20
was kind of a zero sump game there and he just gets completely punished for it so game turns on its head very fast I
2:04:26
mean a complete 360 here or 180 rather I should say yeah and um wait so DX took
2:04:33
five grubs is there one still there there is so somehow they got them to get away from the last grub so that fet of
2:04:39
strength hasn't actually come on through just yet the dragon was taken by bro man I'm confused I need to fill in those
2:04:44
blanks somehow yeah cuz hok was on the bottom side of the map but UK had a lot of control over the bottom waves I
2:04:51
thought he wasn't going to necessarily be able to take it then they also didn't get the and there's like question mark ping I think the question mark ping is
2:04:57
telling me more about what could have happened than anything else um as you now moving back up there towards this uh
2:05:04
grub Camp I'm trying to think if there's like a reason why you would want to I feel like alive H probably should just
2:05:11
go over there immediately but maybe they just don't have enough information as to what's going on and sponge should be able to get over there and lock that one
2:05:17
down as there we go going to wanted to just like rush over and try to contest
2:05:22
dragon as fast as possible I don't know really what ended up going down there and we'll probably never know without watching the VOD um maybe you guys know
2:05:30
and you guys watching a little more closely but if DRX win they can let us know in the interview with whoever gets
2:05:35
player of the match um maybe that's what it's going to be that's right we're no longer P we're P I didn't really want to
2:05:42
talk about it cuz it does kind of make me a little bit sad because p is just it's so POG um but now we're a bit oh my
2:05:49
God think of the emote possibly Palm champ Palm champ is pretty great wait do
2:05:56
we just get like pool potty skins so it's like palm and pal like pom pom pom like this is by the way potentially
2:06:02
first turret if there's not a a better answer here hok is very late yeah closer should have the wave clear to be able to
2:06:07
take this one down but man that is well and truly set up remember this is six scrubs as well yeah I mean I think it's just I think it's just dzo yeah should
2:06:14
be I mean they have to bring so many people up here to stop this UK can clear this so
2:06:19
quickly and I mean there's just no no realistic way to stop this unfortunately for bro Sox really bringing this game
2:06:26
back after what was a rocky early game cler will be able to at least clear out this wave Morgan putting on some
2:06:33
aggression here in this bottom Lane as well uh head by 22 CS right now even though there is four minions to be
2:06:39
picked up here by Rich and so control of the bottom Lane is there for bro but outside of that a
2:06:44
little bit of a worry arakan going to be spawning here towards the top side no surprise yeah viciously yes he's going
2:06:52
to voraciously spawn on the top side of the map uh UK playing very respectfully
2:06:58
here I don't think we'll see any craziness out of hok in this case but they feel compelled to group up here on
2:07:04
the top side because if UK's just given a little bit of alone time that is dead turret and pizza strength completed so
2:07:12
that's just a big win on the bottom side of the map for DRX elsewise as you can see Sponge here has full control can
2:07:17
take the Scuttle and bro don't actually set anything up here a lot of loss CS really well played mid game here for
2:07:24
DX thus far yeah it's working out very well just need to find a way to grab that first turret and they are looking
2:07:31
real good as far as being able to find some uh nice new shoes and things like that Feats of Strength the team that's
2:07:37
managed to get you know the most of them uh has won the series uh has won the game thus far samp size is one um but
2:07:46
the win rate is still 100% um no matter how you slice it take that Bron yeah
2:07:51
exactly take that mathematics all right Morgan uh going to get taunted otherwise
2:07:57
he's not uh too worried but you can see rich is just doing that Gallo thing where you just don't take a lot of M D
2:08:02
yeah he's like yeah I'm just getting a little warm here um but I'm pretty okay with it cuz it's winter it's cold outside yeah he likes the sauna strategy
2:08:10
you it uh helps him with his morning routine we did see conqueror picked up for Morgan uh so it's no surprise that
2:08:16
he did go for the rift maker looking for a bit of a brawly dueling Style here on
2:08:22
this Rumble which is going to suit the match up into Gallo as well as uh him being a big threat later on in these
2:08:27
team fights where you're going to be at Close Quarters because of the Aurora ultimate so I do like this choice but
2:08:33
down goes the turret yep that is just going to be first turret blood going on over to DRX and so that is two ft of
2:08:38
strength and some cool shoes up and available here for the squad once they do have those two legendary items
2:08:45
secured and we're getting closer and closer to that of course youal does have one of them done that luden's picked up
2:08:53
all right huk trying to clear out some Vision Rift Herald going to be taken here by Sponge man bro need to find
2:08:59
something and it's so weird right because we have often said that bro's
2:09:04
ability to just try and make plays to get themselves back into a game is what they've been missing no matter what
2:09:10
players have been on this team it's always been a big factor for this squad and I think closer is the one if there
2:09:18
is ever a player to just do something r that might work like it's him it did not
2:09:25
work last time but he went for ITF he went for it no I mean that that's so true though that that is the type of player that closer is and that's why he
2:09:32
suits hok's play style so incredibly well and why we watch Kook up and got a lot optimism super optimism I should say
2:09:39
but in this game he's kind of been bullied by UK a lot of the time cuz you you mentioned like Bros so known for the early gam so known for their objective
2:09:46
control even early on even without this roster um but you know what known for winning Aurora and she's kind of winning
2:09:52
pretty hard she has right now currently the biggest individual gold lead on the map you mentioned the first to pick up
2:09:58
that luden's companion and the game State here is really tough for bro to fight out unless DRX make an error so
2:10:05
they're kind of just giving these objectives up Herald is going to crash here into this mid turret be the second turret likely taken of the game cuz they
2:10:11
have six grubs I mean this boiling is going to pop out and I mean there's just nothing you could do to stop this so they just keep collecting gold and
2:10:18
getting more map control here you can see Rich has just been given so much leeway in this side lane where the
2:10:23
rumble really can't break through his shield and he's just like cool I'm chilling winning everywhere and he's
2:10:30
even had the goal to build like steel caps yeah he's like I don't care about you Rumble yeah exactly I just want to
2:10:35
make sure that I am going to be able to get things done in these team fights of course steel caps if you do get the upgrade as well are completely
2:10:41
ridiculous um and so yeah it's looking pretty nice second dragon to be picked
2:10:46
up here by DRX by the looks of things Uka going to come on over and add some support uh follow should be able to
2:10:52
clear out this Ward and moving on over and yeah it's a grand exit you can understand exactly why as Morgan might
2:10:57
be able to get something done here going to be taking some blood pedals as well certainly going to feel good minute and a half until arakan does turn up and
2:11:06
yeah I don't think we've had quite the amount of aggression that we need um in order to get a ruinous arakan so it is
2:11:13
once again the aanan and uh yeah yeah I mean
2:11:18
unfortunately for Morgan he wasn't even to even to get that turret there on the top side lazy fi lazy field coming up he
2:11:24
could Al in yeah turet there's a lot of Al in uh availability of course rich not
2:11:30
going to be a to ult in on top of himself as Morgan was even able to get a blood pedal that was pretty cool Justice punch avoided and the void Seeker not
2:11:36
going to seek anything or not going to find anything at least as The Equalizer getting a lot of value but Morgan's still dead sponge going to be able to
2:11:42
grab that one huk looking for an opportunity here but I don't know whether he's going to be able to find it decent little St but it's under rich and
2:11:47
he's so tanky another Wall comes down but closer is just going TR to put it away immediately Rich taking out the
2:11:53
sacrificial Gallo but in return it looks like we're going to see UK take that bottom side turret so sacrificed himself
2:12:00
you take the rumble off the map and UK's going to get more gold on this Aurora and I feel like this is still just a
2:12:06
huge trade up for DRX it's a small consolation prize you could say for bro
2:12:11
but I am very concerned about what the rest of this mid game is going to look like as we Prest 20 minutes here and Aon
2:12:17
spawns things are looking Grim maybe trying to find a little bit more here Kong's ult is down so sponge isn't going
2:12:22
to be able to do much they do actually have hype here as well so some respect needs to be shown they might be able to trade this turret for turret against
2:12:29
small victories and we haven't really seen the big Wombo team fight right we haven't
2:12:35
seen like the utilization of all of the circles and the resets be attempted here
2:12:41
by bro I think there is an opportunity like there's a world where Bros composition does work right like they
2:12:47
have a lot of explosive damage available and if you do line up and equalize it correctly and then H can get those
2:12:54
resets as yes adakan is only red ladies and gentlemen the ver vicious version is
2:13:00
once again gracing the rift how noxian of him it is quite nox which is uh
2:13:06
certainly on theme absolutely true well with this shiv too in the mid lane lazy
2:13:11
field was just constantly able to affect waves and then go pressure side Lanes like he did with that last play top side
2:13:18
just all coming up DRX right now and that third game that we were hoping for seems more likely by the moment it's not
2:13:23
over by any means but like you said closer really is the one who has the most agency to make a big play happen
2:13:29
because he has that semi Global ultimate has the ability to set up a single Target pick he's going to need to you
2:13:34
know get over here soon they have vision of this stopping it's another story they know exactly what's going on and it can
2:13:41
be very dangerous cuz the amount of shred that you do get huk moving on over and the teleport's coming in all right they are committing to this andil taking
2:13:48
a fair bit of damage as now Morgan has turned up the equalizer going to be so dangerous team fight comes down Killer Instinct into the backline it's a
2:13:55
phenomenal heroic entrance and lazy field is popping off he gets into that backline that's a triple kill for the
2:14:02
Vietnamese player and bro they are sent packing that is Aon going down as well
2:14:08
so Richie can feel free to try and die because it doesn't even cost them too much at all and that's that combo that
2:14:14
you were talking about in the team fight all the circles coming in Rich dropping that shield on top of an already
2:14:21
incredibly tanky poppy there in andil who's positioned to try to deny any
2:14:26
entry here I mean look he blocks cl's ability really set up a Weaver's wall here goes to the wall look at this equalizer it's decent here but once the
2:14:34
ultimate goes down I mean you're you're stuck on top of an Ting rich and Ting sponge here lazy peel as you said popped
2:14:41
off in this fight and starts cleaning up house on the other side of it nice counter to kaisa he says as he takes out
2:14:47
his opposite number in hype four kills now on the kaisa extremely accelerated I
2:14:53
mean we're even on blood pedal Stacks but put that graphic away I don't know if it really tells the story of this game right now I don't think so um what
2:14:59
tells the story is a little bit the gold on the top of the screen there 4 and 1/2k going to be the lead for DRX the
2:15:06
fact that they've got a couple of these dragons as well full control of the Dragon pit at the same time I mean they
2:15:12
have the reses now too so they can just dive and with no consequence minute 20
2:15:18
as that is ticking down and so yeah you can see sponge very happily basically in the enemy base uh because you just can
2:15:26
how it goes two items have been picked up here by the Wukong as well and it's a very dive you know focused comp when
2:15:32
from ahead like equalizer just to clear the wave here is just showing the desperation the ult is back up for UK
2:15:39
spong's ult's back up rich will have his in just a moment so you have to play so respectfully as bro but that means your
2:15:45
turrets just get taken off the map tick scrubs let's see whether they
2:15:50
can find an here as hok's like well how am I supposed to reset they can't die I mean vgo is not really known for his
2:15:56
flank engages necessarily from behind a situations like this yeah not very tanky
2:16:02
oh there's 30 seconds and then bro I think just need to pull the trigger I think you're right but you win
2:16:09
a fight you'll get some pedals and some gold it'll put you back in it but it's just a limited win if you can get it that is to
2:16:15
say well rich now just moving on over Justice punch is odd he's just right underneath that turret trying to get
2:16:21
some use out of this uton passive the ulti does come down there from mukal and DRX just going to wipe the floor with
2:16:27
that turret they take that one down real comfortably and yeah Rich invests his entire health bar but he would have
2:16:32
probably even preferred to die go back to base and buy and stuff like that yeah he's a I have TP now I have to waste all
2:16:38
of this time pressing B and stuff oh man he's like guys the withdraw animation is
2:16:43
faster than the Reco can I just die and that's when uh that's when the team is
2:16:49
telling him absolutely not but uh what's interesting too about this lineup here for DRX we'll talk a lot about this
2:16:55
when we go through the rest of uh LSK Cup and the regular season of lck but this roster for DRX doesn't have
2:17:02
necessarily like a strong shot calling voice I mean Rich has a ton of experience right I think he's going to
2:17:07
have to pick up a lot of that um ucal in the past has been fairly vocal but then you have sponge who's still relatively
2:17:14
new player lazy feel is playing his debut game right now and Ando who probably is the quietest player in the lck is known to why but I think that
2:17:22
Andel like has been this guy that's known a lot right I I think that I don't necessarily think he has the
2:17:27
assertiveness as far as his character but I think that he could work I know that CV Max was working with him like
2:17:33
very much on uh quondong freaks previously trying to make him into that guy so maybe he found some success yeah
2:17:41
well my point is I mean despite that despite my kind of like I don't think this this roster will necessarily have good shot calling early they're looking
2:17:47
pretty clean with their macro decisions you know like that's good to see that's a really positive sign this early on in
2:17:53
the year literally in our debut game here you missed a cannon so I think it
2:17:59
might be doomed I think it'll be okay the Bro comeback starts
2:18:04
here well it's going to have to actually if they are going to make a comeback do you bro Le in Magic Atlas well it ain't
2:18:09
bro while I'm breathing wolf as is what I hear and currently um the the way I'm
2:18:16
talking is with air and so I must be breathing okay in goes Rich doesn't find the taunt he can fish for those as much as he
2:18:22
would like and never really be punished for it 6K going to be the advantage and the baron I think going to be that last
2:18:30
nail in the coffin yeah there's some gold sitting on the sneaky with our ward in the back not by the control not
2:18:36
spotted just on the edge there uh they also had vision of the controller as you can see by that Ward ping so it's
2:18:42
actually kind of uh strategically placed there I think not the coincidence but
2:18:49
have the back by and return void staff done for UK this is a big Aurora and
2:18:54
they are happy to start this it's on Vision but sometimes seeing isn't everything Atlas as they say very true
2:19:01
kuk is going to lay down some Mist let's see whether he can find a way in here to try and get something stolen away seis M
2:19:06
shove going wide hug in position like this could be a difficult Baron as
2:19:12
sponge decides to turn it he is able to lock that one down humock gets in there but doesn't get away with it and that is
2:19:18
Rich locking down that kill they do manage to take down the Wukong but the knockups are just gigantic they take
2:19:24
down Andel but hype is still in so much trouble lazy feel wants to flash in and he will do so takes down his opposite
2:19:31
number and he's going to be able to help Tidy Up Morgan there as well the Lord could not save them and bro I think
2:19:37
you're going to have to play a third game in this series looking likely man unel is having a fantastic night Atlas
2:19:43
he is really feeling himself in this second game in particular but even in game one had some decent moments and uh
2:19:50
that is that paper's not going to be able to steal the baron and he just Falls instantly The Flash followup knock
2:19:56
up though from andil was just chef's kiss and now the base is falling here
2:20:01
again at 27 minutes yeah I don't know whether Polo is going to be able to save this one as yeah lazy Feld with these
2:20:07
three items completed is doing so much damage void Seeker almost killing Hut on
2:20:13
the fountain where he stands but the Nexus will go down and that is a tied up series lazy field picking up the very
2:20:20
first victory for an import on an lck team here in the lck cup we are breaking
2:20:26
records and making Milestones all over the place here today yeah he wanted to spread the the record breaking across
2:20:33
two games he was like I could have won game one but then I wouldn't spread the love so game one first time he's ever
2:20:40
played you know non in the lck game two first win yeah and then he can win his
2:20:45
first series or even lose his first series it's fine it's going to be a first no matter what true as we go into
2:20:51
game three I think there's a few takeaways there for bro as well um there's something cathartic about Zia
2:20:56
losing cuz I feel like that champion has frustrated us for about 3 years now and she always loses I mean she just does
2:21:02
yeah she had like a I don't know I pulled the stat last season she was like 30% win rate or something maybe it was
2:21:07
even lower than that uh it was crazy anyway atas we got to go back to the draft again both of these losses I feel
2:21:14
like are somewhat heavily tied to the draft there were definitely some windows for bro but they didn't ban Aurora yeah
2:21:19
in game two we're so many other Champions are disabled because of fearless and UK tops the damage here was
2:21:25
he the main character would have you even gotten P if we had did P probably not but the fact that he can warp these team fights and they have such a strong
2:21:31
robust draft here that works so well together all five Champions have Synergy together in this draft I mean it is just
2:21:38
night and day what that these two teams had to work with absolutely I think the answers were beautiful by DRX in their
2:21:43
draft I think the Top Lane Gallo certainly a a phenomenal adaptation here from rich to really close the door on
2:21:50
the Rumble um so certainly some things to be taken away but what I love about it is we get a three- game series in the
2:21:56
very first one of the lck cup time for us to go to a short break when we get back space is going to break it down and then we'll have game number three see
2:22:01
you soon

2:29:15
DRX pick up their first win of the Season makes it one to one who will take
2:29:20
the first series of the 2025 season we'll find out in just a little bit welcome back to the space Deon alongside
2:29:26
chronicler and ox and you know the the 2025 Bros the Kasa Cup champions all the
2:29:33
good feels that that didn't that didn't last as long as we thought it would hype is uh not there cuz he was playing Zia
2:29:40
and and and really I think that kind of solidifies that uh even though kaspa cup was a very impressive achievement in it
2:29:47
of itself it doesn't always really tell the full tale of what's going to happen and I think we saw in this game that if
2:29:53
they don't get the start they're looking for uh bro unfortunate and arguably they kind of got the star that they were
2:29:59
looking for and it still wasn't enough a yeah so we see in this early trade lazy feeli ends up burning flash uh the Ron W
2:30:07
raon trades Flash in return but this ends up paying off pretty big for bro because they're the first to capitalize
2:30:12
on it and andle makes a bit of a mistake here just steps up unnecessarily gets chunk down pretty heavily takes a little
2:30:19
bit more damage from raan as well and at this point it's like well I can't really stick around I'm going to recoil but I
2:30:26
feel like there should have been some uniform decision between them either they both stay or they both go but leaving your ad carry like this is just
2:30:33
kind of leaving them to the walls this in theory looks good right you're able to immediately have uh take
2:30:39
lazy th out get a lead on your snowballing jungler but and this is
2:30:44
where we're not going to talk about the draft in too much that but I do think that one of the big things that we've seen in Solo que as well is that team
2:30:51
fighting is everything right now we have so many fights way more than it feels like we used to have so having a
2:30:56
composition that can actually team fight really well and then you look at the draft from DRX and that was Circle
2:31:02
Galore right between the Aurora El between Wukong between Gallo between
2:31:08
poppy trying to move in a fight and playing in the 5v5 is extremely hard yeah so after that set pack though then
2:31:14
we've got highlight number two here 540 at the Drake and uh you're like uhoh
2:31:19
maybe maybe bro doesn't got this yeah so great move there from Andel to stun the raan poing a raan really good for this
2:31:25
reason and this kind of starts off the return cuz they managed to secure the dragon here and despite losing First
2:31:32
Blood making some Headway towards those feat of strength and then we get this fight up towards the top side once again
2:31:37
andle leading the charge in his puppy andle actually having a an exceptional game and the big thing here is that with
2:31:44
any vgo comp you want someone to play off of but the only other person that provides reliable SU is raan who's
2:31:50
playing into poppy so it feels like every single fight they're unable to
2:31:55
really find a Target there's also a lot of slippery Targets on the opposite end so you're not really finding anything
2:32:01
and then on the re-engage obviously kind of runs you over was doing there uh yeah
2:32:06
actually while that was happening uh I was saying man I've done that play as tiia and it just it's
2:32:13
horrible fortunately closer oh no he's he's also dead yeah I I I had faith for
2:32:19
just about second there yeah I I think closer forgot it's it's it's hero hok
2:32:24
and and Commander closer he tried to beat hero closer that one didn't quite work out final highlight here oton fight
2:32:30
at 21 minutes and again the Bros get into the objective a little late looks okay but the immediate turn in the
2:32:37
circles yeah I mean the engage here on the Z is beautiful ult shoes but this is one of the issues with Z is like your
2:32:43
ult can dodge one bit of CC you then have to flash out of the Aurora Al which is timed well you just get ran down by
2:32:50
the Kaiser and the game is just done from here Yuko actually having a really good over game very clean always where
2:32:56
he needs to be and I do think that this was the right call because we checked Wukong had like and this is Wukong right
2:33:02
with his passive had like 60 armor zero Mr so in case you do catch them off guard I think oton can be a turning
2:33:08
point but the positioning that was really awkward freem men were trying to then engage on a poppy cuz huk so
2:33:14
desperately wanted the reset and ended up being a bit of a disaster just the late engage works so well and I feel
2:33:19
like they the ones starting the fight and as well as you said like looking at the poppy as the first Target you can
2:33:24
understand the thought process to get the resets but it's just never going to pan out yeah now tied one to one DRX
2:33:30
fans have the opportunity to fly their flag in the chat if you haven't heard you can get yourself a sub and you know
2:33:35
who didn't have a sub in the chat a little bit earlier well our friend Salazar did and Z2 Z2 that that's G gon
2:33:45
saying I need to sub bro it up please and Salazar the homie even though the didn't win got it on over the slogan for
2:33:52
this season is is noxus power is taken not given and yet here gon is being
2:33:59
gifted the sub I don't get it just I mean the grift worked you know
2:34:04
it just comes in it's like can I get a sub please absolutely you can shout out Salazar for he's a he is a true bro
2:34:12
that's what we know from this they didn't even win they lost the match still waiting to gift five Subs that's a
2:34:18
player for you bro a no Str changes to losing right there's still gigachad if you at home want to go ahead and give
2:34:24
some subs you're able to do so right now in the chat and fly all the flags and unfortunately this one here there are no
2:34:30
Flags flown so far for ruinous uh Aon because there's been and we've had
2:34:36
fights for Dragons we've had fights for for grub so it's not like nothing is happening like there are actually a lot
2:34:41
of back and forths but unfortunately still not enough to wake up Aon and I
2:34:46
think the Aurora is 100% the number one pick they look at with this draft and go
2:34:51
okay that's definitely going to be a big one to be missing in the next game yeah I think for me my takeway is kind of you
2:34:58
know game one handback was on this corner huge amount of impact really strong pick not a fan of having him on
2:35:03
the vgo I think he does a great job of leading the charge give him a pick to lead the charge rather than a pick
2:35:08
that's like okay well if my team set up I can get resets the thing is the comp didn't have that much reset as well so
2:35:15
you know sometimes fa like oh we don't get the pick anymore I think uh Broan should be happy that get the vgo anymore
2:35:20
yeah the vgo didn't really work closer off I know his tiia is one of his better Mage but like off of melee pick always
2:35:26
feels rough and then hype I do think that one of the things with with Fearless is that your pool gets pinched
2:35:32
more and more but as o was saying earlier there's kind of a critical massive dive you can reach where Zia
2:35:37
just doesn't do the trick anymore and if it's just kaisa maybe it can give the benefit of that but that was like
2:35:43
basically every single champion on the enemy team was going to be able to die like even just Wukong being near you for
2:35:49
shoot to all yeah I also think that like certain CH like if you're playing Z into VI you can avoid the AL really easily
2:35:55
like that's effective into aora like you Al up and then you come down and you're still in the AL and then you have to
2:36:01
flash out the Al and then the Kaiser just runs you down like certain Champions your all really does deal with
2:36:06
well I think another example I remember wolf mentioned last year was like the cannon where you jump up and then you come down the Y still running you just
2:36:13
get stunned anyway yeah that we spoke a lot about Bros and the Champs that they played on the opposite side we finally got to see lazy field get comfortable in
2:36:19
match even though the Ling part didn't go so well got a triple kill earlier closed it off with a double double with
2:36:25
ucal on the Aurora so let's see what they have in store here DRX and bro
2:36:32
these two squads battling for their groups to get themselves win this is a game that both of them looking across
2:36:38
the border thinking we got to get this one for team who will be able to do it let's find out together as we send it on
2:36:44
over to Atlas and wolf thank you so much ton thanks for the breakdown guys and yes I'm hoping
2:36:50
that we don't see any more paper man and the uh The Feathered lady because feathered lady just here in the LK does
2:36:56
not get very many WS you won't see it anymore in this series I can tell you that I can guarantee it yep thanks Wolf
2:37:02
I appreciate that you're the one that actually guaranteed that they weren't going to be played again um it's nothing
2:37:08
to do with the Fess draft don't you worry about that one and so now we've got like the full 10 Champions that are
2:37:14
officially banned away plus another 10 bands to be layered on top after the bands all do come through in this game
2:37:20
so some some PS are going to get pinched let's just say that uh you mean you know going into this one 20 + 10 right is
2:37:28
that what I said did I not say that I I see yeah okay so I it's just wrong I'm just telling you there's even more B
2:37:34
it's going to be even more Banny um this is how it goes so some of the pcks that
2:37:39
have been banned every game are still protected and so now you can kind of toy with uh leaving some of those open and
2:37:45
trying to grab them on uh first pick here as bro so picks like the AER the kalista the ash how do we trade those
2:37:53
how do those go through ambessa also another pick that's quite strong right now by is another y they're both going
2:37:58
to be banned away though the two junglers that have been towards the top of the priority list um Ash vars they're
2:38:04
the biggest ones for me uh is DRX are they just going like they have to start
2:38:10
Banning them now because they have to ban both I think or none of them so you just have to see exactly what's going to
2:38:15
happen because they've also been permanently Banning AIA throughout this whole series to try and take it away from CLA so I
2:38:23
he's had some good a games but it's not a champion that he's necessarily known for I'd rather see them ban the Ash and
2:38:30
the varis but they will ban the azir here so it guarantees uh that as long as Protestant ban one of the two here in
2:38:36
this final slot that they should be able to pick one of those up alternatively could go for the ambessa first pick and
2:38:42
still very strong right now and there's no Rumble in this game as UK's LeBlanc
2:38:47
is taken away a second time yeah going to be removing that one so now Varys or
2:38:55
Ash or just neither of them and I assume it's going to be neither of them um the kalista is a big one she's been banned
2:39:01
throughout the entire Series so likely that that one is just going to be taken away unless they're okay with playing
2:39:07
the ash into it Ash has obviously been a pick into the kalista quite a few times and so they're going to ban the ash away
2:39:14
hope for a Varys first pick and then allow lazy field to Plate kalista into the varis which not NE it's not
2:39:20
necessarily the greatest match up better into as I think they're kind of hoping to play it the other way they're like hoping kalista gets picked and they get
2:39:26
the varis um but they could have traded it differently I would have rather seen the kalista ban here or a varus ban the
2:39:33
ash one's a little bit peculiar I think varus wins out the bottom Lane matchup there a lot of Versatility in terms of
2:39:38
how his scaling works so it just makes a lot of sense the hype would pick this up it's one of the picks he's known for as
2:39:44
well um and lazy feel isn't as uh you know well versed let's say on the
2:39:49
kalista I'm not saying he can't play it but it's not a pick he has often played in Challengers or in kaspa cup banned a
2:39:56
lot cuz it's very strong we'll see if they have a different answer here the ambessa can be quite strong in dearis as
2:40:02
we're just going to see the Shia locked in well Zino and the rata glass coming
2:40:08
out here so kalista rata very powerful bottom Lane if they do end up locking that one away I think it's a bit of a
2:40:14
no-brainer is what it feels like to me hold off on both of their solo Lanes as well to try and keep the ambigu
2:40:20
ambiguity as high as possible does feel really good um to bolster the kalista
2:40:26
into a lane where she is outraged and can give you a little bit more power there and the only other pick they could
2:40:31
be thinking of is Draven but I don't think that's what we're going to see here it's pretty obvious to get the nus here as well with a lot of that support
2:40:37
pool pinched here as Morgan the Lord on his Renekton there it is the Renekton
2:40:42
makes it all the way through the entire Series without being picked or banned and Morgan is like oh yeah by the way
2:40:48
this is my Champion really strong setup here for bro in terms of their early
2:40:54
game the kalista looks like it is going to be the the pick that we expected yeah come through there some hesitation here
2:41:00
perhaps just talking about what they want to ban after this I uh in fact already wrote it down um before the
2:41:07
Nautilus was locked in because uh felt like a little bit of a no-brainer as soon as the ambessa sorry the uh Rado
2:41:14
was locked in so some other picks that you know we've seen in the past be quite strong uh in this meta are like the
2:41:20
silus but doesn't feel great to lock that one in here as bro right now necessarily feels pretty good on the DRX
2:41:27
side though really Broly right kind of uh suits what they're looking for n going to be taken away from huk
2:41:33
certainly something that does suit his aggressive play style although it does feel a little bit out of left field n
2:41:39
Renekton though very powerful the Zyra the Zyra and the N do give you the
2:41:45
opportunity to play a strong 80 mid um so that's something perhaps they were a little bit concerned about and even the
2:41:51
potential Flex of a Renekton into mid could be possible but less likely in current year uh we'll see the or taken
2:41:58
away again this leaves the jacks up it's been entire series he made it through was band when the Sani was up but now
2:42:05
left available gragas blind very safe does give you the mid counter pick for
2:42:11
ucal also gives you the opportunity to go towards some ad in the mid lane if you would like to as well um so
2:42:17
certainly a lot of options there as far as at least getting a larger damage profile
2:42:22
this is where things get tough for uh oh the brand I was wondering what okay closer just locks in yo that's like
2:42:29
that's that's what we're doing that's that's how it's going to work out sure there's not a whole lot of setup for the
2:42:35
ASO I mean you have the Nautilus ult but can be quite strong but blind of
2:42:40
course I thought it was going to be Lilia but I I kind of like the brand you know like it's so like there's no range
2:42:47
on DRX yeah I mean you just burn them to death and you know it feels pretty good
2:42:52
when you also have this really beefy front line you have the Renekton and the n and then you have a Yas and now we're
2:42:58
going to fight fire with fire here with ambessa mid which we saw in kespa cup actually was debuted debuted by Maple
2:43:06
yeah um which is really cool stuff of course it was the last tournament of his career now I think that there's a lot of
2:43:13
ways to get access to the varis here for the side of DRX they have the ability to
2:43:18
kind of get through that front line with the Hostile takeover potentially they also have uh xinia is very beefy can get
2:43:24
close the gap then you have cast to split the team in half and then M besta can just cut through all of that front line and hit hype as the final Target
2:43:31
then the followup is definitely there but if the fights get slowed down if they're for any reason playing a neutral
2:43:38
game where they can't engage quickly or they don't have map control or Vision that brand tick damage is just going to
2:43:43
keep burning we may have a game where you see that damage off the charts for the brand when we see that post game
2:43:49
screen and he's ending up being the MVP yeah I uh I'm really I I already love
2:43:56
fist Dr here in the lck for the lck cup uh just because I wasn't expecting drafts to look quite this off the- wall
2:44:03
but this is a really fun one Brandon Yasuo as our mid jungle on the side of the Bros and then this Mega Brawl
2:44:10
composition from DRX the amount of go in we can't go out on this team is
2:44:16
absolutely absurd plus then they have the gra to create as much chaos as possible so that when they audaciously
2:44:23
charge forward um they can find you know those uh those stragglers those targets that have been left out to dry the
2:44:29
biggest question mark for me Atlas is going to be this yasu works well with the brand in the mid 2v2 with jungle but
2:44:35
outside of it if they fall behind it is going to be a tricky game with both the yaso and the Renekton falling behind in
2:44:40
a big way not necessarily able to pick up the slack so this early game like games one and two going to be critically
2:44:46
important I would 100% agree with you wolf this is a whole lot of fun game three the decider between bro and DRX
2:44:54
let's get into [Music]
2:45:07
it all right welcome ladies and gentlemen it is time to get into the
2:45:12
final game of our first series of the LK cup bro on the blue side blue side so far has been 100% sucess uccessful and
2:45:20
so if you are a bro lever that certainly does help you out as far as uh giving
2:45:25
you some optimism almost said optimism like an idiot I caught myself though
2:45:30
don't you worry about that make sure you get your flags in the chat though if you are a DRX believer maybe you're just a
2:45:37
huge Rich fan you know from way back in his HS career until now maybe you just
2:45:42
love 2018 KT and I would not blame you for that so you're voting for youal want
2:45:47
to throw that DX flag in there make sure you do so and please if you could gift a sub to Brenan Valdez as well because he
2:45:54
cannot sub because his account is Korean uh and it's really difficult thankfully I made mine in Australia and so
2:46:01
therefore I was able to do so um but uh some of us are not so lucky that's why of course gon had to ask for herself uh
2:46:08
as well uh she was under the bus a little bit there I'm just asking for one because you know the people being so
2:46:14
nice uh I don't have any excuse exactly um but uh Clos I looked it up he has
2:46:20
100% win rate on yaso one game 100% win rate oh that's my favorite sample size
2:46:26
yeah he is a a wind bro connoisseur cuz he he he does seem like the type of player would be a big yaso enjoyer you
2:46:32
know what I mean oh yeah it feels like it was 100% he's still a fairly young player he's been around the LSK for a
2:46:38
while but you know was a trainy and then a sub behind Faker on T1 in 2021 but uh
2:46:43
you know that when he first played League of Legends when he was like 16 he was like yeah y for me probably played earlier than that but you know what I
2:46:49
mean like in his early formative years 100% of y m definitely um that was off
2:46:56
like he was a z main until he was the Y main okay that's the that's the energy he gives me um and that is absolutely
2:47:02
fine youal fighting with closer here just a little bit of course ambessa has a whole bunch of buttons that do a whole
2:47:08
lot of stuff there's still some dashing to be done here from closer as well minions to deal with as well but down to
2:47:14
about 100 health is youal drinking that potion as much as possible down to the shield both of these Champs are you know
2:47:20
cooldown based obviously Essa has energy but it's you know not really a huge limiting factor and they want to
2:47:26
continue to press their buttons nonstop so it's a crazy match up oh handshake here very polite is endle but probably
2:47:32
going to kill the person he just shook hands with at least going to give it a good old go the college try as as you
2:47:40
will the early game going really well for the kalist here before hype has been able to layer much poke um he did go
2:47:46
halil of blades interestingly and not the any of the other variants that we have seen actually I kind of don't mind
2:47:53
that so there are a couple of schools of thought right you can see the low range on the side of DRX and you can be like well I can go on hit and I probably feel
2:48:00
okay about it or you can say Well they're going to have to stand around they have no range is now hype in a
2:48:05
little bit of trouble here sponge making his way over wind does become lightning The Flash has to come out they're going to accept that one for the moment
2:48:12
towards the bottom Lane though is H get some Vision down this pillar of flame could do a bunch of work the hook goes
2:48:18
WI though it's closer he's going to turn up great handshake comes in as there's the wind wall sponge going to have to
2:48:23
flash away lazy field doing the same thing and another pill comes through and the bailout not going to be working this
2:48:29
time first blood and AA strength going over to hype and another hook connects as Polo pick up the first pal of the of
2:48:36
the the tournament my friend he's definitely getting it this guy's so good looking very good so far and man we have
2:48:43
had some aggressive early games a lot of it been around those grubs but in this
2:48:48
particular case just in this bottom Lane it's the Rome from closer that's a big difference maker UK does not match said
2:48:55
Rome and just a num advantage that they have there and you know hype's incredibly low early on in this play
2:49:01
zoned out but he's still alive so he can still offer that damage P when he rejoins look at what's happening as
2:49:06
ambessa is backing ukala is leaving you can see there's already a roaming closer
2:49:13
coming down here and bro just completely or sorry DX just completely outnumbered here and they're trying their best I
2:49:18
mean a good win becomes lightning coming through here from sponge they're trying their best but they just cannot win this fight the bailout will only buy time way
2:49:26
too much damage here it's the most value I've seen out of the tiny wind wall as well you know wind wall at this level
2:49:31
just really isn't that large but that choke point also not that large as that's a very happy humu there after
2:49:38
picking up a whole lot of value here for his team only a couple of assists for him but double kill for hype that's
2:49:44
absurd I mean with the brand damage that early on I mean it really does stack up in those longer and when you don't have
2:49:49
your ambessa showing up to to offer anything back to get on top of these squishy damage threats you're just not
2:49:55
going to be able to win that that fight unfortunately sponge did the best he could but won't be enough well Morgan
2:50:02
just going to be feasting on these minions as you can see and Rich doing okay he's actually uh keeping up in farm
2:50:09
quite comfortably of course Gras is pretty good at nullifying almost every lane match up as Clos taken a bit of
2:50:15
damage here from UK as we can see both of them had very recent teleported back to Lane Morgan's turning up let's see
2:50:22
what's going to happen here as sponge already getting to work on these grubs I believe the first one was taken by huk
2:50:28
and indeed it was so it should be two to one no feed of strength going to be com Down The Flash Forward here as the ruthless Predator comes down the knock
2:50:34
up from closer to follow up lazy feels on the floor and the Bros they did not appreciate that game two lost no they
2:50:41
certainly did not and I think they are appreciating the early game lead that they have here in this one first Blood
2:50:48
picked up by them early will be able to get two out of three grubs and look at the lead that hype is holding on to here
2:50:54
on vars to get a pick that he's known for I mentioned it earlier on in this series already has his Dirk online
2:50:59
starting to stack a tier he is just going to be such a huge threat in this game and you can see lazy still falling
2:51:05
further and further behind this is a ranata that's left to catch the farm here and this is just unfortunately a
2:51:11
lot of greed to be frank for DRX in this situation they have no control over the zone and once again UK cannot join the
2:51:17
fight pretty happy about how that one's going Edgar sitting pretty comfortably here
2:51:23
he's like yeah I want to stop looking now that was a really good bit and let's just uh Edgar of course has been known
2:51:29
to be very passionate about all of the teams that he has coached um one of our more famous ones here in the lck all
2:51:37
storied and good to see him happy here in the first series or at least for now
2:51:43
now of course anything can happen first Blood doesn't necessarily mean you definitely take the victory as second
2:51:48
third and fourth you know G two so far first blood has a 50% win rate that is pretty close to that 57% win rate that
2:51:55
first Blood had um based on the stats that were released by fron earlier on um
2:52:00
something like that there is a there's a segue there yeah really like it that much I I I'm concerned about how muted
2:52:07
UK's been in this game you know he's been he had that aggressive trade earlier but otherwise hasn't really interacted that much it's just been
2:52:13
catching waves and this just means bro are first on the RO first on the aggression sponge level six here but
2:52:19
isn't going to be able to cut anybody off and you know if you STI stick around hok's like yep I'll just keep burning
2:52:24
you he's got his burn online he's ready to to really put some hurt onto the DRX
2:52:30
members here slowly over time the Drake has spawned no one has taken it once again youal catching this wave here but
2:52:37
there's no setup for varus you know we see hot going towards the top side of the map here so we're not going to see an early Drake take for bro just yet
2:52:45
there's a timing window here where DRX could potentially set something up yeah we'll see whether DRX can actually
2:52:51
find a little bit of a window into this game so far not massive amount behind as far as gold is concerned but I just feel
2:52:58
like the map is in Bros control they should be able to uh utilize that in
2:53:03
order to create a larger Advantage as the game continues closer with those couple of assists he is down a little
2:53:09
bit of farm but you can see as he moves closer and closer towards item number one this yo is going to become a real
2:53:15
problem s side Lanes going to become a thing that uh d is going to find difficulty dealing with unless UK can
2:53:21
get some advantages on this Esser and make himself a threat Morgan fighting
2:53:26
against Rich this Top Lane is just not going to be that interesting guys um it's going to be barrels and and Lego
2:53:32
crocodiles and that's that's about it at least it's the the ren toy um it is it
2:53:38
is that's my go-to Morgan can be trusted to go for the cool SK yeah he he knows what's up he is Mr Renekton after all
2:53:46
this is a cannon though so that ain't great going to be moving up here towards his top side oh the disengage CK there
2:53:52
from rich is gorgeous and the brand all he can do is W Lumber slowly towards you
2:53:58
yeah I suppose H could have flashed towards Rich there but just a really well taxi or something yeah it was a
2:54:04
really well placed cast there from R uh knowing exactly what he needed to do to get out of that situation and prevent himself from flashing um and that being
2:54:13
said you know on the other side of the map because of that uh you know it's a successful deny on the gank and they get the draag out of it so DRX bouncing back
2:54:20
a little bit here in this game getting a small golf clap from the DRX side because it's still a pretty tough game
2:54:26
State here but lazy F also massively up on CS despite being down on gold and down on kills going to pick up a plate
2:54:31
here split with andil as well so it's not all doom and gloom there is still some hope here and if they can get one
2:54:37
team fight win they're right back in it and the fza strength situation looking okay here for DRX they've picked up
2:54:43
their first objective of course they need a couple more if they are actually going to solidify that but this bottom
2:54:48
Lane out of turret is extraordinarily low the laning power of this rata kalista is working exactly as well as it
2:54:56
says on the 10 you know this is an incredibly powerful Lane we've known it for a very long time but it's good to see that they're actually putting it
2:55:02
through its paces and making it do what it needs to in order to give the give them the advantages that they want in
2:55:07
this earlier stage of the game and it doesn't always work that well into the varis but with the Nautilus here they
2:55:12
abusing the melee support incredibly well hype didn't take uh the Comet or anything like that try to poke his way
2:55:18
into advantages just wants to sit back he's got three kills so he's feeling okay but at least lazy field is getting more back bro will be able to get these
2:55:25
grubs as you mentioned the satisfaction of watching bran take grubs oh never gets old yeah it's very uh very fun to
2:55:32
see that'll be their first um objective feet taken since they did get all three
2:55:38
so five grubs here for this comp that's already got a pretty strong Side Lane little bit scary
2:55:44
absolutely if uh Kos gets himself into a side lane which is exactly what he's doing now this yaso could really start
2:55:51
to run away with it as far as these uh towers are concerned see what lazy field
2:55:56
can get done though does have control of this minion wave for the moment and so closer is just going to have to grab this as it does come past
2:56:02
some reset opportunities here for this kalista as we got 3 minutes until the hexte dragon is going to be spawning
2:56:09
atakan going to be coming up in 8 minutes time and we've got a rift Herald on the docket next it's up in 2 minutes
2:56:15
I love I love this by the way we were talking about it just a little bit and there are just a lot of objectives that at all times there's always
2:56:22
something coming up yeah right um in fact right now there's three things coming up yeah I feel like this is like
2:56:28
it's only a minute 45 but it feels like the biggest low we've had all day so far yeah but you know there's a lot on the
2:56:34
docket as you put it um rich is is doing a really good job of clearing these waves and trying to proxy this now and
2:56:39
putting a little bit of pressure on to Morgan I think the way back into this game for DRX is just an incredible
2:56:44
engage from UK right like he has been pretty absent this game he's 00 Z at this moment in time has been catching
2:56:50
waves you know had a farm lead ear doesn't have it anymore but he's just been sitting on the ambessa and trying
2:56:55
to come online trying to be relevant if he gets into a team fight or wins out on the Sid Lane like this then uh that's
2:57:01
one way back into this game if he can put a lot of pressure onto this turret I mean this is huge for DRX really is
2:57:07
sponge in position right now as well hok going to move on over though so I don't think this Tower is going down right now
2:57:12
especially with Polo moving on in not able to land that one as lazy field taken down to 50% as hype is raining
2:57:18
down these arrows this Varys could become a problem as well because this poke is largely
2:57:24
unanswerable unless DRX just go for an Allin so they're going to have to really be ready to pull the trigger in this
2:57:30
game otherwise hype will just have free range and he's already 3 0 I think the
2:57:37
vision game is so important here for DRX they need to be able to see those opportunities they need to be to see
2:57:42
setups here for bro rotations over to Dragon what flank angles are being set because brand is also very vulnerable um
2:57:49
to getting blown up and caught as well he does a lot of damage but he's very squishy if he dies first in the fight you have a real Fighting Chance speaking
2:57:54
of brand yeah there's the Flash Forward but Rich catches him in the body slam
2:57:59
that's going to deny the stunt and means that humbo not going to be able to get anything from that one gives him the good old thumbs up you'll love to see it
2:58:06
rich on his time in Nim here domestically had a lot of really good gragas games and this is not going to be
2:58:12
an exception terms of how well he's neutralized this Renekton so far feel like it's it's looking like a bit of a
2:58:18
Renaissance for Rich I feel like he also had a pretty good time in the opening um tournament as well uh even though the
2:58:25
top laners didn't necessarily win out as the hook comes through from Paulo gets the knock up onto Rich sorry about the
2:58:30
cter curse as yeah I think huk might have the damage does find himself the E
2:58:36
there's the stun beautifully done Sears him down that is a uh medium rare gragas
2:58:41
in the Top Lane well fortunately though for DRX they already got first turret blood in the bottom side with uh the
2:58:48
push from UK so at least this turret going down isn't going to be the end of the world for them and we're still
2:58:53
waiting to see who's going to get that feat of strength DRX having bottom side control means they also have pry for this Drake so rich bought some time up
2:59:00
there his Cask was beautiful even though it wasn't enough to save him once again onto hok there that means that they will
2:59:07
look to take a two Drake lead and that could be something that really keeps them hanging into this game if they can
2:59:12
secure it the big problem the elephant in the room is the brand though you know he picked up that kill does have his
2:59:17
LeAndre all ready is just going to become a bigger and bigger threat the longer this game goes on so as DRX we
2:59:23
really are priced into taking the Stak Rich has teleport so he can join into this fight but they gave up a lot of
2:59:29
control they're just letting bro spill in and so that Advantage they had moments ago is now kind of gone yeah and
2:59:35
this is feeling like the closest game so far of this series there not a whole lot in it 2,000 gold might feel like a lot
2:59:42
but as you can see with these objectives both team uh just neck and neck as far
2:59:47
as as that is concerned even if this Dragon goes down another object objective is going to need to be taken
2:59:53
on either side make this one happen so very interesting can DRX find
2:59:58
this Allin angle that they're looking for Rich has grouped up with the rest of his team level two Alti has been secured
3:00:05
as well UK has a huge opportunity if he can get out of that side lane to make an impact here but he's still clearing the
3:00:10
wave and the Poke is real they've got poke from both the brand and that vars
3:00:16
Morgan slowed down a little bit here UK a little bit apprehensive to follow up with his jungler as Morgan's going to be
3:00:22
pushed away does have the Dominus available no flash though is now rich in that brush does find the angle here
3:00:28
under hok there's the knock up hok getting himself out of the way though and he might actually be safe sponge cut
3:00:34
down where he stands and the brand survives another Hook is going to land there because poo does not miss those
3:00:41
Morgan very very low though as lazy field doesn't get the execution on the Rend and now it's hype he has that range
3:00:47
Advantage the fade call though may have baited them out hype gets knocked up but there's no followup it's just po that
3:00:52
does go down the blinking health bars on both sides the knock up onto lazy field
3:00:58
that is a lot of damage there as in goes UK Cal to lock down lazy field does get
3:01:04
the bailout closer utilizing that wind well so beautifully but now can UK
3:01:10
survive this is that the triple yes it is and DRX they're on the board and in a
3:01:15
big way a quiet early game for you oh boy he was on a w well things turning up
3:01:24
in a big way here for DRX with Rich committing the teleport they're on the dragon now but a quiet early game for
3:01:30
ucal and he really blows up this fight here really nice usage of the brush
3:01:35
there from Rich they get on top comach and yes he survives here for so long and they end up losing out on Sponge because
3:01:42
of it but look at Lazy field he's late to the fight but he's full health and this kalista in these types of Scrappy fights is just so incredibly strong
3:01:49
everyone is so low Health it's hard to actually get in there and finish off lazy field positioning is great hides
3:01:55
behind andil uses the fates call and even the varus outranges her kalista can actually do so much in these fights as
3:02:01
hype is just not Landing these knockup does come down but he's able to Marshall pose and kite his way out then UK says
3:02:06
I've had enough finally flashes in picks up a ton of gold in this exchange as
3:02:12
well again spent most of the time in this game under turret but sets up the initial engage onto the and then
3:02:18
finishes cleans up the fight with all those dashes well played showcasing his mechanics on the Champions three kills
3:02:24
for the ambessa two items online absolutely massive fro still with a
3:02:29
slight gold Advantage but it was really starting to look like the game was running away with the Bros and now it's
3:02:36
even closer than it was before po possibly out of position here at the same time the hail of arrows is going to
3:02:42
slow down sponge he has to use the ultimate good handshake there from Andel as okay The Herald is going to lose
3:02:49
interest Paul is just going to be cut down though that is going to be the bailout successful but immediately it's locked up again lazy field trying to
3:02:56
find another angle here to get even more aggressive but a one for one in the end not going to spell out too much yeah if
3:03:03
DRX gets this heral that is fat of strength done for them so really important the sponge that goes down here
3:03:09
that's it's very difficult to go turn back and take that heral after a trade one for one you the one with the gold
3:03:14
lead right now but you can see lazy f is dead even with hype now having a CS lead for most of the game
3:03:19
but those three early kills for hype pushed him into the advantage but the kalista again hanging on to a threat in
3:03:25
terms of relevance and how she scales into this game it's been a tough time for sponge he is really trying to do the
3:03:32
best as a melee Champion as he can here into this really frustrating long range vars as well as the brand going back
3:03:40
into this setup here you can see heavily committing to taking out Paulo they really want to get this Herald because
3:03:45
it speat of strength for them handshake here is decent and you can see that the Crescent guard buys enough time to
3:03:50
actually turn this one around they will be able to get the bail out on the sponge but it's a trade one for one does critically though deny the herald yep
3:03:58
hostile take over actually getting a whole bunch done there as well really buys a whole lot of time so nicely
3:04:03
played there by Andel so sponge does clear up the red buff and we're clicking
3:04:09
uh we're ticking closer to this arakan spawning going to be North Side once
3:04:15
again as it generally is we've had a fair few kills but he's still red so never you mind it's going
3:04:22
to be the voracious boy this red is my face is going to be end of this we so is is the is the BET like the
3:04:29
amount of uh like ruinous aons that we get is it based on this week or this
3:04:35
whole season just this week I think even if it was this whole season I still would have said zero starting to look
3:04:41
like you might have been wise uh to that Atlas um to to make that decision as DRX
3:04:46
again they still really want this Herald they have pryo right now hok is not able to put any damage into DRX just yet all
3:04:53
right the Lord's flank angle is looking a bit dangerous here as the rift Arrow going to be secured by huk Morgan can
3:05:00
Flash and gets on top of lazy field but the F goal is pretty good hype untouched though until UK gets into that backline
3:05:07
still it's going to be a flash out hype still in pretty good position huk dealing with Rich at this point in time
3:05:13
but the hero that is our Lord is going to get over the wall and then back over again UK using all of these dashes and
3:05:21
it's just not going to be enough to grab the brand humach is just so slippery this game it's so hard to to lock down
3:05:27
that final bit of his health his positioning has been great he's going to be able to layer enough damage in here now it looks like to actually take out
3:05:34
this OT and if he actually dies there you know without his leandre's damage I don't know if they actually could take
3:05:39
this and that was speat of strength as well this is going to be Pro being able to upgrade their shoes absolutely some
3:05:46
fancy Nikes is now available for this squad and looking at it like you can see the the swifties as well upgraded
3:05:52
swifties that feels pretty fantastic for you varis and this a few good things I can get this fight is so split look at
3:05:58
where hype and Pao are Paulo is basically just a bodyguard in this situation while offering a lot of CC as
3:06:05
well and you can see the hype becomes a Target here for Uka gets over the wall positions incredibly well uses the
3:06:11
terrain to guarantee that when in his most vulnerable moment he could still get out and that puts UK unfortunately
3:06:17
on the wrong side of the fight to actually go clean up the right side where hok narrowly escaped so really
3:06:22
good positioning from the new ad carry KT rollster player on loone here to bro
3:06:28
he looked great in kespa cup as a big reason why they won that title and he's looking great in this final game of the series as well three early kills
3:06:34
utilizing the gold really well in that last fight too y amazingly done and they've moved up to that uh pretty
3:06:40
comfortable 3,000 gold lead at this point in time and you can see there the
3:06:45
gold really did come down to a pretty nice spot but once again bro have writed the ship might be their first dragon of
3:06:52
the game as well once again it's going to be a mountain Soul which is kind of nutty I'm finding it hard to keep up
3:06:58
with everything normally we've talked about which Soul it is far before the dragon has in fact spawned and being
3:07:03
killed um but there's a lot of stuff here you know very different yeah and
3:07:09
we've also got the buff for arakan still for another minute so bro can be pretty
3:07:14
aggressive and I feel like that certainly suits a player like closer who is now going to drive Shelly into this
3:07:20
big gun in the mid lane yeah Morgan also Sid laning on the top side so this 4-1 setup here is incredibly powerful and
3:07:28
they have the withdrawals so I mean they're not vulnerable for anything they can go in chain the corruption does come
3:07:34
down turret is getting a little bit angry knock up onto sponge but not one that closer wants to follow up on and
3:07:39
they'll take two turrets for their trouble a third possibly going down as well if Morgan can get his uh minions in
3:07:46
position but he's not quite a B to do so the rest of bro now just going to try and set up for a little bit of a gank brush 30 seconds on the clock as far as
3:07:53
that uhan Revival is concerned this just the stalemate here that bro in when the
3:07:59
minions get here DX just trying to group yeah flash over is great handshake for the disengage out of Andel but in comes
3:08:05
Morgan he's pre- alted as well just trying to keep them busy it is going to be Andel going down first up but you can
3:08:12
see there is a whole lot of uh getting sent back to the Fountain here for the Bros hype just trying to stand in
3:08:18
position and deliver this damage youal should be able to take him out though and there it goes that's in fact just a
3:08:24
kill I believe yeah uh because hype didn't die fast enough nicely done there by DRX I mean the rest of the gold
3:08:30
that's picked up there too is significant but I think what they got in return a lot of map control a lot of deep Vision it's not it's not like it's
3:08:38
a trade up for bro in terms of gold or anything like that but it was worth the risk I would say at this point in time
3:08:45
definitely getting a little bit L Fair with it here um and the is full health
3:08:50
and it's new turrets on this patch so they kind of do hurt but I get the idea especially because Morgan has teleport
3:08:56
so if he ends up dying and withdrawing same with uh closer if this fight were extended they could have just rejoined
3:09:03
uh and and it would have been fine but you know it was it was a little bit broken up so aren't able to really get the value from that they end up
3:09:10
dying yeah yeah slow yeah slow slow slow so that we can actually get a kill and
3:09:16
UK has has been you the early game was was quite uh absent let's say from him
3:09:22
he wasn't able to make the same room as that closer did but it's made some big impact impact plays from behind to keep
3:09:28
his team in this and they are still in this but I mean they Feats of Strength
3:09:34
did go over this next dragon fight will be critical for DRX to try to secure his sole Point here before this gets two off
3:09:40
the rails Cleaver done for UK I mean this is maybe the best fight they're going to get for the rest of the game
3:09:46
and it's not great but it's it's probably the best one yep and UK as well close to the highest level in the game
3:09:52
as you just saw and he still has a gold lead even though there's been five kills picked up by Clos and now po going
3:09:58
aggressive once again lazy field feels like he has a good angle and in fact he does change the corruption does nothing
3:10:04
and the exhaust comes on through there as well the bailout was on lazy fi he didn't even need it two on the floor huk
3:10:10
joins this yaso and down goes the Lord as well four on the ground for bro and
3:10:17
and DRX they run into the baron that was a huge ult from Mel as well at the end of the fight to guarantee they can clean
3:10:23
up house lazy field does a ton of that damage HBO survived for so long but
3:10:28
ultimately still is taken out he put a ton of damage in there but it wasn't enough and DRX picking up this Baron
3:10:34
will almost completely nullify the gold lead it's going to be about 10000 that's the difference between them after this
3:10:40
Baron is taken and it's going to guarantee they have objective control for the next fight as well you can see
3:10:46
how this fight breaks up again looking for hok as the target he lives for so incredibly long lazy field goes
3:10:53
incredibly low flashes over the wall has a Fates call for the re-engage and you see andil ult Fates with the uh hostile
3:10:59
takeover at the same time and there's just no one to get on top of lazy who survives with 150 Health just fantastic
3:11:06
me watch this again how low he gets before he goes over the wall avoids the chains of corruption which is really
3:11:11
unfortunately for bro a huge difference maker in this fight oh man
3:11:19
so well played by him and andil together and they front to back beautifully
3:11:29
done all right an incredibly close game after two one-sided stops it's crazy and
3:11:34
like I can understand like this level of motion yeah it's game it's the very first series of the year right this is
3:11:40
the LC cup we're not even in to like the full regular season of the lck yet and
3:11:46
already emotions of this to yeah possible angle here as rich is very
3:11:51
healthy as Morgan looking to chase after him can they hold him in position that's going to be the question as the turret goes down in the mid lane oh wait the
3:11:59
way oh he's out there and the Bros are on able to stop him he's down into the
3:12:04
bottom Lane and he's pushing with UK the rest of DX is going to be pushing I think the call was probably initially
3:12:11
hey Rich is a lost cause let's hard push mid and bottom but then Rich gets out with the TP as well no one can shut him
3:12:17
down and they get two turrets for it he doesn't die and this Baron is 4,000 the Red Bull power play here yeah and it's
3:12:25
only going to get worse it's one and a half minute left on this Baron as well so there is a lot more time to get even
3:12:31
more done here with this buff and they can also utilize it to get soulle point with this mountain Drake that is up and
3:12:37
available sponge already getting to work on that one man the this game is just completely flipped on its head who said
3:12:44
that this is going to be all about snowballs because this one has gone both ways like about seven times so far this
3:12:51
game croner has definitely said that's Challengers baby at least three times at least three times in front of the television over on the space but look at
3:12:58
what hok has in his inventory right he's got his old the only thing he really is missing is The Flash but he's got an arm
3:13:04
guard for survivability he has the tier three Sor shoots shoes you know two
3:13:10
incredibly strong items the slow and the burn like he is ready he is set up to still carry one of these team fights but
3:13:16
they need to buy time for him by space for he's been the Target in so many of these fights and yes he does a lot
3:13:21
before he dies and he's been positioning really well but he's still you know pushed out of these fights and isn't given the time to actually maximize his
3:13:27
damage they don't have a mage midlaner so they really need him to do well speaking of yeah Morgan going to have to try and protect him here as a Flash
3:13:34
Forward great cast but maybe he's now it no he's not lazy field is going to be able to find him hanar going to go down
3:13:39
extraordinarily low the bailout is it going to be working here and the answer is it doesn't actually have to because
3:13:44
he doesn't even go down oh never mindly burn will do it and hok doesn't expend
3:13:50
his arm guard there so he's actually still got that he's able to realize like okay I think I've done enough here we
3:13:56
could just get out even if they don't get that kill there he's like probably want to have that for the next objective fight want to make sure we could shut
3:14:01
down DRX from getting that mountain Soul so makes a wise choice there in my opinion cuz I don't think they would have turned it even if he was able to go
3:14:08
golden there so holds on to that critical item uh we have his flash for the next dragon as well now the baron is
3:14:14
done so while this is a great proactive play from the sponge I don't think this is going to be the back breaker necessarily especially because he goes
3:14:21
down and expend his flash in the process here yeah that c actually really
3:14:26
beautiful there from Rich with the full information of the rest of his team moving on down from the top guarantees the kill onto hok and in the end it is
3:14:34
going to be him able to lock down his opposite number so a one for one and
3:14:39
honestly the game feeling like it's switched all the way back towards DRX especially with this Soul point that
3:14:46
they have up and available with this brly composition that's quite short range they can utilize these shields so
3:14:52
effectively if they do collect that mountain Soul not to mention the added tankiness it's just always going to be good now you know some of the other tier
3:14:59
three boots that we could see come through here the upgraded swifties for hype uh which will give him tons of movement speed and okay hold that
3:15:06
thought yeah that's going to be Morgan taking a whole lot of damage here from UK who's just not taking any damage at all Morgan realizing that he just needs
3:15:11
to deal with a minion wave and he's not even going to be able to do that and UK collect his six dying so far today in
3:15:19
this game I mean that might just be an inhibitor to go down hpe did get those tier three boots right after I said that
3:15:24
but and he's going to be really fast and hard to lock down they're not going to commit heavily to that inhibitor just going to back off take that small win
3:15:32
but I I do think this game is winnable on either side like yes DRX have a lot of map control right now they've got some deep Vision as you can see around
3:15:38
the red buff down there on the bottom side looking to try to grab this Scuttle here top side as well is sponge but
3:15:43
won't be able to do it looks like this one is going hok's way sponge not even going to go for the steel and this this
3:15:48
next fight is is so critical right it's either going to be over the baron or what could be Mountain soul for DRX and
3:15:54
I think the the main characters here are going to be hok and hype um across all 10 players could be the most high impact
3:16:00
and who kills them or tries oh the flash has to be invested as rich just finds
3:16:06
him that's a big one oh you and that is that ultimate's on a very low cool down at this point in the game as well level
3:16:13
16 on this gragas so he should have that up and available and the few seconds time that we have the baron spawning is
3:16:20
having a day out today he really is I mean he he did since the opening event he's having a great time even when he
3:16:26
was playing uh Pike the bottom Lane yeah yeah good old support rich and uh yuka's got a ga getting that flash off of brand
3:16:34
is one of the tools gone he still has his uh arm guard I was mentioning earlier UK on the flank here looking for
3:16:39
maybe grabbing hog once again but whiffs it yeah going to be spotted out on that Ward and so hok knows that he can just move out of the way and with that public
3:16:47
execution now on cool down maybe the Bros are going to feel like they can possibly fight Baron has just spawned
3:16:53
this second how much can hype and hambach get done to DRX in the neutral
3:16:58
fight oh don't overextend Bros okay they do get the vision they know what's going on as you can see Morgan champing at the
3:17:05
fit really wants to get a fight started the rest of DRX they're going to peel
3:17:11
away look for an opportunity Morgan going to get hand shock here as lazy field getting some sticks into him
3:17:16
little bit dangerous here but he does get over the wall UK's coming online fairly soon here he's still on the flank
3:17:22
catching either hak or hype will massive is the teleport that's a bit of a short one but Rich gets himself into position
3:17:28
hbar goes golden but he's the jungler and he's just going to get executed he does a bit of damage on his way out but
3:17:35
that is not going to be enough and the Bros is not going to be able to stop this Baron they might be able to deny a
3:17:40
dragon I guess but even that's up in 20 seconds and this Baron isn't going to last very long at all the kills have
3:17:46
been even out but the gold is well and truly in the advantage of DRX and on their second Baron they might just be
3:17:53
able to win the game I mean the the whole mission for DRX is to try to find and kill hok even though he has the armu
3:17:59
guard he doesn't have Flash and he's just way too far up there finds himself isolated and once again UK makes the
3:18:06
play he's on the flank and once that that the damage is gone for brand there even if he tosses his old out it's not
3:18:11
alone going to be enough he needs time he needs some additional space bought by the front line to actually get that burn
3:18:16
through with some poke coming through from hype if you actually get engaged on you've already lost you have to be buying some time or you have to be
3:18:23
burning for some time before the fight actually goes off if you're going to be successful they did not set that up DRX
3:18:28
are proactive they pick him and that's Baron plus Mountain Soul here and I
3:18:33
don't know if I can call this a close game anymore it is looking like we are looking for DRX to close this one out
3:18:39
it's not over till it's over but this is kind of the snapping of the neck of bro yeah you can have your Feats of Strength
3:18:46
will just take soul and two Barons and that should be enough and to be perfectly honest I do not doubt them DRX
3:18:53
looking so so strong and oh hook going to go wide there as rich just going to
3:18:59
use his Burly finesse to get himself out of the way body slam beautifully timed they take down the
3:19:05
turret and the rest of DRX here towards his bottom side you count in the Top Lane the split is well and truly a foot
3:19:13
now they have good wave clear that's one thing they definitely have going for the them in terms of clearing this hok alone
3:19:19
is really going to make quick work of these waves closer as well if he's given some time won't take him too long UK is
3:19:24
just going to sit over here alone and take out this turret slowly but steadily they what they really want the real
3:19:29
prize is though an inhibitor 80 seconds left to go bro could save the pressure off here maybe there's a chance back
3:19:35
into this game yeah Clos you can see going a little bit aggressive onto Rich who has about 7 million health so he'll
3:19:43
be absolutely fine he's on that top inhibitor turret yeah that should be taken down here unless closer can make
3:19:48
something happen he throws out the ulti Morgan trying to get over there slices dice gets the stun but it's not going to be enough The Flash out from UK is
3:19:55
enough disengage and now Rich could be in trouble or he could just be way too tanky hype trying to get some damage
3:20:01
down here sponge taking a little bit but throws out the Cresent guard ucal in some trouble great knock up here from
3:20:07
closer he has to flash though to get out of the way the brosa fighting as hard as they can but it's just not quite enough
3:20:13
lazy field is inside the base I don't know whether that was necessarily the right call but it looked really cool and
3:20:19
Inhibitors are still going down for DRX it's a huge win here for DRX either way
3:20:25
but bro technically survive here as now all three Inhibitors have fallen both
3:20:31
Nexus turrets do at the moment stand and UK is really you know quietly the MVP of
3:20:38
this for DX because he pulls bro to the top side of this fight this then allows Rich to split tomok off and they don't
3:20:44
get the kill on UK not even close he has G so we can really push the issue here with this ultimate all the while you
3:20:50
know lazy feel on the back here is is untouched and sponge's Cresent guard absorbs a lot of the damage and yeah UK
3:20:56
will eventually get taken out by some of that burn damage from hog but it's you know I think if lazy field actually just
3:21:01
plays this a little bit more respectfully they probably end the game I like the Rush of Blood to the Head though and once again hats off to Andel
3:21:09
his hostile takeovers have been absolutely fantastic so far this uh this
3:21:14
game and that was once again another example of that you know wasting so much of the Bros time wasn't able to hit hype
3:21:21
which is a large reason why bro I think looked a little bit better in that um but still everybody else was well and
3:21:26
truly tied up and hype now just needs to turn that Durk into something and he's got six items same can be said for lazy
3:21:33
field with this arm guard that he also has which is a really interesting Tech as well I kind of like that often we do
3:21:39
see it on things like uh Kaiser but kis it's a different one you don't necessarily scare with as much of the AP
3:21:45
but uh certainly cool to have that St available it works really well with bailout too depending on how you utilize
3:21:50
it um can be quite tricky um you know your teammates do a little bit of damage for you then you get bailed out last
3:21:56
possible second as soon as you come out of the arm guard uh DRX I mean just letting the minions do the work here I
3:22:02
mean we have six Super minions spawning at a time with all these Inhibitors down bro have great wave clear which could
3:22:08
buy time but they're going to have to buy it for three more minutes if they're going to win this game and it's just so difficult to see it yeah huk is really
3:22:15
going to have to make this wave clear work for them and uh he's bran so it's it's pretty good to be honest it's
3:22:21
working okay so far yeah these Nexus turrets have not taken a lot of damage still rich is looking for that opportunity The Flash out from hype has
3:22:27
to be invested chains of corruption will be the trade it's a decent hook and Rich taking a lot here but are they actually
3:22:34
able to kill him that's the question the overextension from hok says no oh never mind he flashes away and he may actually
3:22:41
live because of course they have no range to speak of without few barrels fing they got to clear these these super
3:22:48
minions though and I mean the Nexus turret is still alive here comes the next wave it's only one here in the mid
3:22:53
lane hok living is so huge because now he can clear this and they live to tell the story of of what might happen for
3:22:59
the rest of this game I mean they're still in such a horrible spot let's not lie to ourselves here I want to be prop
3:23:05
optimistic here but it is a very very tough situation Elder spawns in 90 seconds here and that's going to be one
3:23:11
of the biggest challenges here that that bro have to face because they still have to deal with these super minions for just about 30 seconds longer than that
3:23:17
really about 45 and that's where things really come to a head yeah there are three Inhibitors down for like 2 minutes
3:23:25
and uh the baron is going to be up again in 30 seconds time so I just don't know whether you're going to be able to
3:23:31
survive with all of these supers just parading into your base and DRX team Elder at it's kind of crazy as the ulti
3:23:38
catches him and once again hok is just on the floor that broken armu guard
3:23:45
looking at him just sadly from his inventory and that will spell a baron
3:23:50
right on the spawn and DRX I think might be able to end it here at the third Baron is the CH yeah I don't know I mean
3:23:57
they're team Elder but they've been doing a lot of baring this game around as look hok here there's a
3:24:04
ward rich on him as well he's just a little bit greedy stepping that for four
3:24:10
to do Raptors here at this point trying to farm up that zonas but he goes down that's Baron into Elder Exodia three
3:24:17
Inhibitors down if you can't win with this one DRX we're going to have to have a talk yeah and I think that they
3:24:23
probably will I think you know with the the fact that Elder was put into the game to stop these sorts of situations
3:24:29
from happening means that I don't think that there's going to be uh much of a chance especially with these three
3:24:34
Inhibitors still down like how good is br's wave clear let's really find out
3:24:39
yeah I think not good enough um especially when he cannot stay alive when uh any of the members of DRX look
3:24:46
at him the Inhibitors will respawn in about 30 seconds here but I think that's
3:24:52
just enough time for DRX to get these waves going in the super minions are still already up here in all three lanes
3:24:58
so they're not just going to disappear yeah well rich is going to find an angle that's a beautiful cause po trying to
3:25:05
get out but once again huk is just left to the Wolves another hostile takeover
3:25:10
is decent but Polo's eaten by a dragon lazy feel is dancing around the battlefield and his dragon is hungry and
3:25:18
it's hungry for the first match win of the lck cup for DRX Teddy was unwell
3:25:24
today lazy field played in Challenger yesterday picked up player of the match and he may do it again here as DRX take
3:25:32
down the Casper Cup champions DRX showing up in a big way very few people
3:25:40
predicting them to win today and then even fewer still with Teddy injured sick
3:25:46
today unable to show up but lazy field came in had some tough early games had some tough Ling phases but stuck The
3:25:52
Landing Andel fantastic play on the ranada and they are able to take it in
3:25:58
the end despite some of the draft challenges they faced in this one as well I really feel like this was a great
3:26:05
showcasing of what this roster has to offer and who is the player of the match WF this is the big question cuz I'm like
3:26:12
I was sure that it was going to be Ando but after Rich had a game like this like that was absolutely out of control
3:26:18
UK really holding it together throughout the entirety of especially that last
3:26:24
game but even in his Aurora game where he really hard carried I don't know who do you give it to I think it's probably
3:26:30
going to be between UK and andil for me I ultimately ended up voting for andil I feel like he was the most consistent
3:26:36
player I probably would have gone that too but I think I mean you really could go for almost anybody even lazy field I
3:26:43
think overcoming the challenges of his big def in some of these games was impressive to see as well I think a lot
3:26:49
of narrative voters will be there for uh for Vietnam right and what a day to be a Vietnamese fan to watch this Morgan
3:26:56
versus lazy field lazy field comes out on top hok was the target man you can tell he's frustrated with how things
3:27:02
went but he played so incredibly well despite it and had a big role to play in this game but ultimately sometimes the
3:27:08
Bounty gets hunted he was found he was killed and the game ended DRX super
3:27:13
resilient in this final game the despite being kind of backs against the wall feeds of strength against them a lot of
3:27:20
deficits a lot of tough Champions to to scale with the kalista obviously the ambessa was a bit of a question mark
3:27:26
wasn't able to make a lot happen in the early game but UK did it when it mattered most when they had that great Target selection that's the kind of
3:27:32
thing you don't often see in a new team like this that's hasn't had that much time together obviously and has some
3:27:38
really young players on it like lazy field who's literally 17 is playing his debut series is to be able to identify
3:27:44
what the target is what the objective is to win a game from behind and to see this team do it this early on gives you
3:27:52
hope yeah and you you could see it as well they were like you could see the DRX just said if we kill the brand we
3:27:58
win the game and that's what they did time and time again and I swear this
3:28:04
veteran Rich voice in this team you can see it taking effect I feel like a lot
3:28:09
of these young players are just like oh heck yeah we got this and then lazy field gets that Rush of adrenaline after
3:28:15
these amazing TKS come in to start off these fights I mean I can see like we
3:28:20
were talking about this on the POG State earlier on like we can see how DRX can look good yeah and I think we had a
3:28:28
great example of that here in this final game of this series but I just hope the rest of the lck cup is more of this cuz
3:28:35
this was a great series of League of Legends to start us off it really was we had some questions about the yoso going
3:28:41
into this uh he made a great impact in the early game some fantastic RS but just kind of couldn't
3:28:47
later um watch the final moment here your boy Rich getting the getting
3:28:55
humach out of the fight and allowing the Exodia to just obliterate
3:29:04
them I missed you I really did so happy to see him back this man has some pop
3:29:10
off this year of lck you mentioned it you you know can see the angles for DRX we can see it for so many of our teams
3:29:17
but almost every team in the LSK you look at you go there's an angle I could see it I can believe and I feel like the
3:29:23
last few years we've had some teams that that you look at the roster and you're like well maybe next year or let's see how much they could develop but a team
3:29:29
like this we'll see how far they can go but they given us a lot of optimism I mean these are Kasa Cup champions they
3:29:34
just knocked out today exactly and that is no mean feat and uh UK 33.7k damage
3:29:40
is a lot more than I was expecting I felt like he did have a lot of s side laning um in this game not necessarily
3:29:46
involving himself that much but when he was there he was really there and really like no complaints here as far as how
3:29:54
this first series went neck and neck one thing that I do have a little bit of a problem with is that I think there are
3:29:59
too many comeback mechanics in the game like it felt to me like bro deserved to win that just because they were doing so
3:30:05
well in the early game and with the amount of comeback mechanics and ways to get back into the game DRX were able to
3:30:10
do so so that's a little bit of a that's sarcasm L gentlemen um just to let you know we uh in a more serious note we
3:30:17
have changed things up a little bit we're going to be revealing the P cuz we don't have PS anymore but have player of the match here um and then throwing to
3:30:24
the space so and the reason that has been changed is because it's no longer player of the game it is a one player
3:30:30
throughout the entire series which is why we were talking about you know the player that was consistently good over
3:30:35
both of them speaking of which it's going to be youal and I think that we don't really have too many complaints
3:30:41
outside of the Victor not looking great in game number one he's like well I've just decided to not die from that point
3:30:46
and that's precisely what he did he didn't play he played Aurora instead but Aurora
3:30:52
has done some of those cheeky Shenanigans um and she is now Beyond the Veil and we couldn't quite get her
3:30:57
picture and so we just threw tier in there instead he was deathless um in those last two games and both wins so
3:31:03
pretty impressive play uh from him overall really turned the game around in game three as well so I I think you
3:31:09
could have gone with a lot of players I'm not I'm not happy he got it he's one of my favorite players that's returning to the lck this year so I'm hyped yeah
3:31:16
me too and we are preparing the interview as well and I love this that we get the interview with UK right now
3:31:21
on his return let's throw it over to dear thank you very much guys this is De
3:31:28
for the first P interview translation ofc cup
3:31:39
congratulations is back after a very long time please say hello to your fans hello
3:31:46
I am the millionaire of
3:31:52
the how do you feel you guys got your first win for group Elder we came with the mindset of
3:31:59
winning even though we gave game one away we were still in the game so I
3:32:06
think we were all really just focused on winning the next
3:32:11
one what did you go into game one with what kind of mind
3:32:19
so Teddy is gone down with the flu and it wasn't the same it wasn't
3:32:26
really it was out of ordinary but I'm really glad that we were able to secure today's
3:32:31
Victory so lazy Phil was actually called up and the language barrier in
3:32:37
communicating and playing as a team on such short notice must have been so challenging but based on your mic check
3:32:44
it seemed like everything was good how is it no I think uh lazy feels actually
3:32:50
really trying hard to be on the same page with the rest of the team so it's
3:32:56
really been very helpful what would you like to say to Lazy feel lazy feel you're so
3:33:06
good you have some of these nicknames are the best blade of Jan or maybe X and
3:33:14
that was given to you for excelling at yasu and in game three you matched up against the yasu with your clean Essa
3:33:20
place and lived up to those nicknames yeah I think when I was
3:33:27
playing during that Amba game game three I actually did feel like I was going to
3:33:34
get P from my game plays so you will face four more
3:33:39
midlaners in the rest of lck cup so what would you like to say to them
3:33:46
take care of me you guys and I'm really looking forward to
3:33:53
the rest of the matches and that's the end of the interview from ukel and back to this space thank
3:34:01
you thank you very much deara as we get to hear dear's translation one more time
3:34:07
for the former a freaka freaks KT Thunder talk gaming and now DRX midlaner UK Cal getting the player of the match
3:34:14
welcome back to the space as it is DRX to get the first victory of the 2025 season uh and again lots of things to
3:34:21
talk about here chronicler what a statement performance from uko cuz obviously if you're in the lck
3:34:26
particularly if you work in it it's really hard to keep a consistent track of the LPL but it's not like UK not
3:34:32
individually but like his teams fun the talk obviously isn't necessarily a standout performer as you guys can't see
3:34:38
O's face but he he obviously know very well um but I I have heard good stories
3:34:44
about him individually and you see a performance like this you believe that immediately right what a comeback of
3:34:49
that player super cool and I think a big reason of why they were able to get the winner today um I got to say though on
3:34:56
the flip side as well the hype for bro taking a bit of a hit here started so
3:35:02
well um yeah did it was pretty good game one it felt great and I think part of
3:35:08
that is due to the drafting as well uh there was one part of the draft that we did enjoy but outside of that I feel
3:35:13
like particularly in game two but even in game number three Bon didn't really feel like they had comps that were as
3:35:19
well rounded as what was picked up uh by their opponents yeah I did want to bring
3:35:24
this point up because the brand in the zenz out this is actually uh bro vers FX
3:35:30
this is the first time we saw brand jungle in the lck into zenza same match up here and you saw from the other game
3:35:36
why this match up makes sense right zenza when he dives into you can just stun him you do so much damage like let
3:35:41
yes you can use the ult to block some of brand damage but he just bounces of everyone uh and the game you know was
3:35:46
looking good I didn't as you kind of saying Ma I feel like the cohesion between the comp wasn't there as much um
3:35:52
especially like The lethality varus started okay but I feel like playing the N into the clada is an ideal and then
3:35:57
later on you just couldn't cut through the bulk with the Lal varus really yeah so so they self counterpicked with no
3:36:04
cuz like the reason why Renata came up in the first place after her initial performances was because in naus the
3:36:10
match up is n unplayable cuz the ult is so telegraphed and then also you're playing and his only good source of
3:36:17
knockups is specifically that nus who already is going to be mitigated so it just feels like uh it's it's leading a
3:36:24
little bit too much into what the players like but it doesn't actually make that much sense also feels split cuz you have like you know brand and
3:36:29
varis are kind of happy for people to come into them and then to deal with them in that way but like yasto and nless reekon are wanted to dive in he
3:36:36
also playing into reada it just felt like the kesian wasn't there for the draft and you could see later on they
3:36:42
were kind of struggling with how to execute things I also think you know you talked about the self kind of B they also ended up playing into this Gras in
3:36:47
the Top Lane for the re which is always painful yeah but you know that was later on if they fell behind early on it was
3:36:54
all bro including in this fight down at the Drake pit at 16 minutes where you know it it was a nice cleanup I think
3:37:00
they get a couple kills at the end here but you're thinking wow Bros just coming on in and you know making it 70 8-0 at
3:37:06
this point I mean initially it looks good right uh they managed to get those picks H back stays alive but the health
3:37:12
bars get low and there's someone who is still very healthy right now now and it is it's not Cante it's the new cassant
3:37:18
it's ambessa and she's ready just to take over the fight what you see here as well though
3:37:23
is that I do think there's an opportunity to disengage and this is the point where bro is going to go back to
3:37:28
and realize if they back off there maybe give up one more member I think the situation is still salvageable but
3:37:35
credit to Lazy Feld as well I don't think that it was a perfect performance today but you are a player with such an
3:37:41
incredible amount of weight on you it's already stressful to sub in when a player has a as an emergency right Teddy
3:37:47
hopefully feeling better soon but then to not only do that but also as the first non- Korean player it's a really
3:37:54
big deal but as oing star of the show there was UK because as soon as he got those kills he was running the game yeah
3:38:01
well after that you're thinking okay Bros settle down a little bit and they do so just here at the heral at 20
3:38:08
minutes you're thinking okay this fight they clean up this should be the end of it as uh again a steel attempt doesn't
3:38:14
work out look awesome here right because of the way that lazy fi and unil Flash if they flash into their own backline I
3:38:21
think they actually have an opportunity to maybe play this out but Morgan was not spotted so as we roll the clip we're going to see this is a very split fight
3:38:29
they throw a lot into hok rich with a bit of an unfortunate ultar doesn't actually get it ambessa also doesn't get
3:38:34
on top of the brand and this is the moment where huk still makes it out and you're like okay maybe bro can still
3:38:41
make it maybe things are kind of okay even after the earlier dragon fight where the Essa got so fed I feel like in
3:38:48
highight the fact we talked about how hard it is for the asro to get ult off in this game like you r on the nor the fact he got a three-man Al there kind of
3:38:55
illustrates this isn't the norm for how fights are going to play out like that fight was that's the only one yeah that's everything they could have hop
3:39:01
for but not what they're always going to end up getting and I think they got a bit too much confidence from that going
3:39:06
into the next play I mean but I feel like when you're playing that type of composition you have the lead here I think at that point it was 13 to7 it's
3:39:13
good and this is where they broke over play their yeah this looks good for a second and then they realize the mistake
3:39:20
they made the moment lazy feel and yuk show up there I think they know that they're cooked because with a a
3:39:26
character like vars in particular you cannot be that far up if you don't know where the opponents are cuz with them
3:39:33
committing there this is basically where the game ends yeah and I I feel like the bot Lane kind of dropped the ball here
3:39:38
like nus missing the dredge line the AL on a non ideal Target the varis missing and you saw how low lazy field was if
3:39:45
any of those tools have been used better this fight could have been different it didn't start ideally but you're missing
3:39:51
some of your big tools to shut down some like a clist you're never going to win off the back of that so time to see how
3:39:56
the votes All Shook Up for our player of the match format as we take a look at the Highlight from our best uh I guess
3:40:03
uh plays here from our player of the match and yes it was UK Cal who had a
3:40:09
pretty solid series here on the gallion game two and then on best in game three yeah so the Aurora pick gets massive Al
3:40:16
value here I even feel like the Victor in game one the team fight that H they nearly won towards the start he got like
3:40:22
a thre man stun three man Al it felt like the Aurora is just dominating with the impact the old timing so good to
3:40:27
catch so many members waiting for summon as bur as well and the good in his game three this fight was obviously the big
3:40:34
cleanup but there's a clip I I have no doubt we're going to see in a second where he catches hand back with the edge of an all where that was just Flawless
3:40:40
like max range so really uh dominant performance here what's also cool is that it's very different play Styles
3:40:46
right we saw three very different champions from him a melee ad character then the Aurora which uh obviously
3:40:54
mostly plays out like an AP assassin and then the Victor and I know the Victor didn't necessarily look as convincing as
3:41:00
we uh we were mid voters which I think is the most obvious one I like the unle
3:41:06
shout out as well I think that ando's a player that at time has shown a lot so Jonah strong and wolf going for that one
3:41:12
as yeah I think as or was saying I know KDAY looks kind of bad but that was a game that they were getting absolutely
3:41:18
clobbered in I think this end score was like six or 17 18 and two yeah we have as well that's poetic
3:41:27
reached closer I love that one and just when defeat was near UK you know what that's by go go that was the actual
3:41:34
thing down at that bottom side of the map that fight over we got we got to step up our game these are these are
3:41:40
these lines are killers yeah wow okay well uh perfect piloting was I was thought
3:41:46
I guess Pon Pony's more in our line but Templar is is is getting poetic on us
3:41:52
yeah it's so cool that we get the thoughts you know I feel like sometimes always wondering about the uh the P
3:41:57
votes now we got to know the P votes not media though we don't get to know what's going on there yeah well uh again
3:42:03
congratulations DRX the first victory of the Season Bros we always have next game

3:46:00
[Laughter] [Music]
3:46:10
baby for anyone who missed it uh welcome to the universe in the world BR yeah we
3:46:16
do have uh a kid and I haven't left the house very much it's been uh a lot of
3:46:22
caretaking a lot of uh fun times though it's very very uh rewarding fulfilling
3:46:28
and all that good stuff but at the same time I've been very tired most of the days and I haven't done a lot of gaming
3:46:34
as well so uh it's good to be back but um for the last two months is basically what I've been doing yeah we haven't
3:46:40
played board game in I haven't been able to visit many people or do many other activities you haven't existed basically
3:46:47
not really online a little bit online a little bit in in small does yeah it's
3:46:52
been fun I think we've talked about indie games like three times since we've been in in baby
3:46:58
land I did go to I did go to China for two weeks as well for Crossfire and then
3:47:04
I came back I was right back right back in the house and uh yeah no but it's
3:47:10
been fun it's been good and Bry has been sleeping well and stuff like that in general no he's he's doing well

3:47:23
easier right yeah yeah you kind of like get into your groove he gets into his Groove it's like okay soft Landing good
3:47:29
and then four months hits and you screwed again all right wolf how you doing I'm good um I had two business
3:47:35
trips to Busan which was really fun it's nice to go to Busan in the winter um I visited the states for 3 weeks so I was
3:47:42
back for Christmas uh for the second time since I've moved moved to Korea I've only been back for Christmas twice
3:47:47
um in 11 years or something 13 years 13 years Dam uh so you know I've had a little bit
3:47:53
more opportunity to go back these last few years which has been nice um it was fun being in America and eating American
3:47:59
food and reexperiencing American life and being in a car for like four hours every day cuz my parents liveed in the
3:48:04
build of nowhere um so when you want to go do things it's like four hours total of driving like to do everything and
3:48:10
then get back to the house but yeah it was it was fun um I haven't played that many video games to be honest uh during
3:48:16
this offseason just haven't nothing's gripped me I've been kind of taking a break from League taking a break from like my long single player games I'm
3:48:22
always playing like Yakuza and stuff so um once the season ramps up I'm really looking forward to that you know maybe
3:48:28
I'll get back into gaming a little bit after work and stuff like that nice now I went on a skiing trip with you that
3:48:35
was fun uh although I didn't ski but I we did another small skiing trip uh together with aios who most of you also
3:48:42
know uh a uh back any you're forgetting to mention
3:48:48
that works on the L yeah I was cat that sorry
3:48:55
sorry and then some some friends as well and then we even at yo on uh who also works in the lck for the last trip so
3:49:01
that was really fun played a ton of cool Indie Games as well as metaphor which
3:49:07
was awesome I did beat that one yeah that was ah I was about to say that that was really good and I went to the
3:49:13
Netherlands for a good while which was also very enjoyable and now uh yesterday
3:49:18
or like a week ago I was like man I really need to play league so yesterday I played 10 hours of the new season I'm back in the groove a good and a bad
3:49:27
way just feeling absolutely fantastic yeah don't look at my uh opgg it was
3:49:34
great uh as for me I uh did manage to make it back to um Australia we had a little bit of a cat scare so um dong
3:49:42
chol our our White cat was just not very well he's got a whole bunch of organ
3:49:48
failure going on but uh for a few weeks there it was really dicey but now
3:49:54
everything's kind of fine it's really weird he's been getting he has to have treatment every day so we've we've
3:50:00
basically said that he's gone from like just a cat to a subscription model cat mhm where you basically have to pay a
3:50:07
subscription fee every day in order to to keep him healthy but he's very healthy very happy and that's uh that's
3:50:13
the main thing um and then I went to Australia uh which was strange cuz we go from the snow to
3:50:20
very warm and I was only there for a week so it was only a little bit of having that summer experience and then
3:50:26
straight back to the cold again we went uh snowboarding or went to the to the snow for a little bit that was great I'm
3:50:31
covered in bruises we watched a lot of gdq as well that was fun we definitely did do that that was also very very good
3:50:36
and watched a lot of magic don't know why like on the first trip it legitimately
3:50:42
seven hours of magic Gathering no no no it's oh just magic magic that's very
3:50:50
achillo it's very achill that's yeah that's uh
3:50:56
interesting as uh as far as games that I played and here's another one that you forgot wolf played Dragon Quest 3 also
3:51:02
which was uh that that game was a lot of fun y that was uh well we didup as well
3:51:09
yeah um well so kpup feels a little bit like a dream because show the best team in the world
3:51:16
is bro good good treat they it's a it's a good dream obviously they're the best team yeah and and like Hive and like I
3:51:22
don't know that team looked like legitimately bro look good they're actually good now they look good the m is the that later yeah there's going to
3:51:30
be a lot on that but uh the kesper cup happened it was a lot of fun um and I'm so glad that it was like so long as well
3:51:36
like eight days of kesper cup for the first time ever they really like brought it back with a bang and our studio was
3:51:42
also really cute and there was an amazing Japanese restaurant like just upstairs that wolf and I would get every
3:51:48
day it was very good it was super good um so yeah that's about it uh life's
3:51:54
been great though but we're very happy to be back I feel like and wolf you and I I think get this the most where we get
3:52:01
incredibly anxious towards the end of the off season I'm like I have lost like
3:52:07
I I don't have a purpose anymore and I like I need this in order to feel like a
3:52:12
person and so finally the L is back to save our mental state and everything is going to be brilliant

4:01:07
[Music] hi woo
4:01:23
welcome back ladies and gentlemen to the lck cup 2025 I'm Atlas joined by wolf
4:01:28
and we're ready to dive into our second series of the day this one the DN freaks
4:01:34
taking on the noodle Boys on nongshim red Force if you are not as acquainted
4:01:39
make sure that if you are sub to the channel you are spamming flags as much as you possibly can and then hopefully
4:01:45
that will mean that we can get more emotes on the channel so we can spam even more weird stuff the future um if
4:01:52
you spam Flags in the chat you will be flagged as a really cool fan as a flag spammer which is only the greatest the
4:01:58
highest Accolade that you can achieve in twitch chat and so thank you for spamming Flags um this matchup is like
4:02:05
our previous one probably going to be a bit of a slugfest definitely could go the distance you know some people have a
4:02:12
clear favorite on in their mind here in no because the roster is heavily upgraded but we saw an upset in the last
4:02:18
series with DRX taking it so anything could happen you can see it's a completely revamped uh quangong freaks
4:02:24
with the new sponsor D and you have Dudu and Bulldog being the core that stays but piosik Berserker and life returning
4:02:32
from three different regions piosik uh from you know I guess was in lck recently but Berserker and Life coming
4:02:39
from Na and China respectively yep and Rapid star of course coming back back as
4:02:44
well no longer is it cvmax he is headed over to China and so rapid star is going
4:02:49
to be our head coach for this squad and I actually think that the DN freaks can get something done with this roster I
4:02:54
don't know what this is the problem with me like I think that there are a lot of people that like you say feel like Nim
4:02:59
are probably the easier bet but anything could happen with this squad they have the power of piosik behind them which we
4:03:06
don't even necessarily know what that means it's speaking of a very similar thing that we don't necessarily know what it means that's kingan he's going
4:03:11
to be leading the Nim red for Squad here joined by Sylvie and Gideon who has now
4:03:17
come on over Sylvia was playing in Challenger I believe so it should be Gideon starting here today and they've got lens in the support position to
4:03:25
augment jiu who is already their star player yeah it's it's kind of a roster that I don't think really anyone would
4:03:30
have expected with two star players kingan and lens coming through kingan of course a world champion from 2022 but
4:03:38
has been inconsistent as of believe absolutely it is now time for us to hear from Berserker though and see what he thinks about heading back to China uh to
4:03:45
Korea that's what we h
4:04:12
d for
4:04:39
[Music]
4:05:09
fighting [Music]
4:05:14
and some fighting words there from Berserker and uh great to hear that you know now he's excited to be playing with
4:05:20
all of these great players and wanting to get some Revenge under I guess his former teammate you could almost say because Berserker did play for uh
4:05:28
Challenger squad for T1 um and wanting to face off against guchu that's not going to be happening today today he's
4:05:35
facing off against jiu the master jungler that we saw in the show matches
4:05:42
a few days ago now both teams going to be making their way out into lowp park here for the first time of 2025 or at
4:05:48
least most of the players for the first time in 2025 it's so wild that you know
4:05:54
Berserker returns so late in his career after being one of the most hyped up
4:06:00
prospects Challengers he had a pretty dominant you know year in 2023 over at
4:06:06
the LCS a pretty good end to the year in 2022 uh but is now trying his uh his
4:06:12
might here in the lck life returning a player who's very well known for playing
4:06:18
some eclectic picks uh you know his set and jarvin he was most known for in the lck but in the LPL playing picks like
4:06:24
The Rumble in the bottom Lane we saw last year L though no strangers as well
4:06:29
to actually playing those unusual picks so I think we have a pretty fun bottom Lane match up especially with Fearless draft coming up yep I agree and actually
4:06:36
think it's really cool L of the Crossovers here between these two teams piosik and King and of course winning
4:06:41
worlds together life and lens both playing with ruler towards the bottom side of the map the Gen G um there are a
4:06:48
lot of these these sort of things that sort of match up between these two squads um Dudu was just there um towards
4:06:54
the top side of the map we'll see how good he's going to be this year I feel like Dudu just keeps getting better and better um but doesn't necessarily find
4:07:01
himself on rosters that win all that much uh so kingan I think is going to have a difficult task here today as that
4:07:09
looks a little bit painful yeah Pik had that in the Opening match as well you
4:07:14
can recover soon that's a sty isn't it that oh those those things really hurt I hope you recover soon pic and hopefully
4:07:21
it doesn't get in the way as it is going to be Gideon starting in the jungle now this is the point of
4:07:26
contention that I think that some of us have um as oh isn't that a wait which
4:07:33
game is that from the guy that always had the the thing in his nose that was a valerant thing as that was a valerant thing right yeah gen play or something I
4:07:40
don't quite remember I I I will say for me I'm team Gideon I actually prefer to see Gideon play I think he has been on a
4:07:48
lot of teams that have struggled over the years you know his time on KT it was one of their most painful years and then
4:07:54
IG when they were struggling and came into bro and now he's on Nim which is a
4:08:00
somewhat upgraded right more promising roster and I think he deserves a shot here early on in the season I think sylv
4:08:06
has been given a lot of time with no shim and was able to improve a little bit for sure like he definitely improved
4:08:12
a lot over the course of last year especially but I think Gideon has that extra star power to him he's got the extra oomph and extra confidence
4:08:19
confidence in the early games that uh especially with players like lens coming onto the Forefront of this roster i' I'd
4:08:25
pick him as my starting man as well yeah I guess you do need to have the ability to turn on a dime just in case lens
4:08:30
decides to go in and that is certainly the energy that Gideon does have and he had a tough task ahead of him last year
4:08:36
so maybe giving him a shot makes a bit of sense and Life coming back I'm actually just really happy about this
4:08:42
like life was he took a long time to really come into his own and then he was
4:08:48
the guy for so many different things here in the lck you mentioned his set and uh and his jarin of course down
4:08:54
there I don't know whether he's going to be playing those picks not necessarily as meta but there is uh there is a certain pick in the bottom Lane that
4:09:00
this guy on screen used to play before it was even cool are we going to see a leas support wolf that's my question
4:09:07
could be uh it's definitely rap star welcome back yeah rapid star is back it's a huge cheer from the audience as
4:09:14
well I I think there's a lot that you know a lot that we'll see different from
4:09:19
these drafts in this series than we saw in the first series and I think some of the priority in terms of bands especially in game one will be very
4:09:26
different I don't think we'll be seeing the scarner I think Aurora will be pretty consistently banned and there's
4:09:31
especially when you consider how many bands get uh thrown in automatically with Fearless uh some of the mistakes we
4:09:37
saw in the last series were kind of inexcusable and we'll see um what happens it's a new format it's a new
4:09:42
year it's a new Rift as dnf will be taking blue side moving into this first
4:09:49
game yeah blue side has looked pretty strong or at least it did in the first two games of our previous series but let's dive into the draft here see what
4:09:56
is going to be banned away and see what is going to be banned into the future by being picked up always fun when we do
4:10:02
have The Feelers draft and once again it is going to be Varys that will be attended to SC this time going to be
4:10:08
taken away there wolf yeah happy to see that Aurora as well will fall by the way
4:10:13
sign here so V's gone sleeves picks like the Ash and the kalista and the ambessa
4:10:19
at our highest priority if the last uh series do anything to go by nocturn one to look out for as well but pairs well
4:10:25
with the Aurora specifically since she's banned I don't think it is going to be as high pryo corki taken away both
4:10:32
Fisher and Je love this pick so that's not a shock it's a team specific band to come through here that you can afford on
4:10:38
blue side yeah we'll see what the final ban is going to be and then where the priority will lie kalist Ash are the
4:10:44
main ones here feeling like it could be a potential trade so ambessa you ban here but then they get to pick the Ash
4:10:50
and then you're playing kalista into Ash um they'll ban Cante instead the duante
4:10:56
has to be addressed will be kalista that's locked away here I think Ash Rada does seem like a decent idea if you do
4:11:03
want to just take that one away immediately of course only needing to grab the Rada Rada andessa could be a
4:11:08
rotation here wolf perhaps yeah I think that's uh the wiser one just simply because you can still get that Ash on
4:11:14
the third rotation be to keep the ambessa as well Essa not a must pick into kalista not the same kind of low
4:11:21
range uh or sorry not low range but low Mobility uh ad carrier that's super squishy that you want to collapse on
4:11:26
she's already low range so you don't need to necessarily Focus her down with the ambessa they go for the Yon here and they could just go yon Sani Gideon's no
4:11:33
stranger to picking that one up yeah could certainly be the bull if they would like to does mean that they
4:11:39
probably want to get some magic damage towards that bottom side GI of course no stranger to things like the sigs uh but
4:11:45
the ambessa immediately locked in there is the rata that we were expecting they left that one up and available so it
4:11:51
goes over for free so Berserker and life like this is a lot of Bot Lane power to
4:11:56
start things off as they make their way back into the LC and there is that Zig so it feels like both teams kind of got
4:12:02
exactly what they wanted yeah it's it's a solid rotation on both sides and the ziggs just wants to take teleport and
4:12:08
avoid interacting with the rata and the kalista anyways and can make an impact later and also can be Lane swap to the top side I think that's what uh DN
4:12:16
freaks should expect to see but it is very fragile um and I like what dnf have
4:12:22
set up so far so what this ban is going to come through as Rumble okay will be taken off the board here expecting that
4:12:29
we could have seen that ambassa Flex to Mid yeah very strong into the excuse me into the Y yeah an interesting ban um
4:12:38
just because it wouldn't have been bad to pick up but I guess you don't want to get too much magic damage so maybe just
4:12:43
King wanting to head towards something a little bit more on the physical e he could be playing the himself uh
4:12:51
technically yeah true although it doesn't really feel that kinging no um
4:12:56
as the Leona going to be taken away from the hens no surprises there of course great uh Leona player almost said great
4:13:01
lens player which does also make sense cuz he's the only it's also the most common pairing with the zigs great
4:13:07
defensively so makes a lot of sense Malai yeah that's going to be the takea away from Ki of course he does have a
4:13:15
weird champion pool to say the least got cooked up for us with the ad mid that they have here it's a pick that can set
4:13:22
up the kalista incredibly well can set up the ambessa really well and it just makes sense damage profile wise to take
4:13:28
that one away koshik is known for playing the Zyra um incredibly well or even his NY which has been very
4:13:34
inconsistent in the past yeah Nautilus is the other defensive support you can have that's very anti-dive down on the
4:13:40
bottom side cuz what's likely going to happen is we're going to stack waves and then Gio is going to be the target he
4:13:46
has teleport so if he does die or has to back he can get back to the Lane but they want to prevent him from having defensive options down there and we'll
4:13:53
see what the hens has in mind here since we are going to go ahead and lock him the Jace here in R4 so saving that fifth
4:13:59
pick for last even though the ranata is already locked
4:14:04
in a very interesting situation might be the tank variety I imagine that kingan
4:14:10
would be certainly someone that would like to jump on that high train top tank smolder player you know y
4:14:18
not shocked by it if he does go it well that is not a lot of range if the akali is locked in here for
4:14:23
Berserker um and a fun matchup as well into the uh the Y name see how Bulldog
4:14:30
does do in this one is that's a Zach yep that sounds like something that piik would play okay this draft is getting off the
4:14:37
rails it's getting weird and wonderful ah this makes more sense he's played it before
4:14:45
he played it very well before in fact Wukong makes a lot more sense to me ah a real pick there yeah and you need to to
4:14:52
have something that can help get that backline access uh going lock those
4:14:57
players in place for the aalii to dive through with the kalista damage coming on top the ambessa really difficult for
4:15:02
J in this game on the zigs and looks like Alistar is going to be the final lock in here not as strong as rata or
4:15:10
Nautilus at preventing dive but can be played correctly uh another similar way to shut that down if you can get some
4:15:17
knockups there under turret with that extra ramp damage those Dives can be tricky to pull off and with the Wukong lock in here not going to be really
4:15:24
happening I don't think uh pre six to set up a dive I mean it's not impossible depending on the lane state but it's going to be a lot trickier than a lot of
4:15:31
other junglers could uh help you do yeah and I'm looking at these two uh drafts here and I'm thinking that uh the DN
4:15:37
freaks going to have to keep this zigs down as much as possible yeah because I
4:15:42
feel like if jiu hits critical mass everyone just kind of dies cuz they all just have to be together when they do
4:15:47
damage they have insane range like they have the zigs Poke they have the Jace poke and there's there go rapid star got
4:15:53
it in the end yeah eventually you know first try it was kind of like me when I was at the LSK
4:15:58
Awards but I mean don't worry it happens to the best of this they they like you say if if they don't snowball this game
4:16:04
if they don't really get the ball rolling down the hill quickly they just won't be able to reach um it's just as
4:16:11
simple as that sometimes drafts really hit this identity break point where one team is like okay we're snowbally we're
4:16:17
low range but we're going to win so hard it won't matter and the other team is like okay if we don't die early we win
4:16:22
no matter what as well so that's kind of the dichotomy we have here between these two drafts it's not too dissimilar to
4:16:28
what we saw in game three uh of our last series but I feel like this is even more extreme yeah and I feel like both teams
4:16:34
kind of opting into it together this time around instead and I wasn't quite expecting drafts of this explosiveness
4:16:41
uh to be coming out in the very first game but I'm down for it and with bulldog making his 2025 debut on a I'm
4:16:49
hoping that's him turning over a new Leaf you're really pulling out a whole bunch of aggression moving into it
4:16:55
because I think that we didn't quite get enough out of bulldog last year same can be said for the year before and so maybe
4:17:01
2025 is the Year of the Dog let's do it no it's not actually year of the snake let's jump into the ri
4:17:16
okay kingan's at half Health we might have to have a remake cuz the players interrupted the fan chance yeah they
4:17:22
did I'm being uh sarcastic of course but that's why they're going back to base no
4:17:28
significant Summoners or anything were used as far as I can tell just a little bit of uh aggression yep a heal taken in
4:17:36
2025 lens oh my goodness not even unsealed spell as well that's because
4:17:42
life wants more life it doesn't make sense that's what they're going to be doing okay so far uh you know we had a
4:17:50
little bit of a fuffle early everyone goes home and the reset means that uh nothing really comes of it um kingan is
4:17:58
not heading to the bottom Lane because they expect a lane swap but he's like okay I'm going to see what I can get
4:18:04
done here early he's just going to hang out with fer for a minute and try to abuse this aali at level one a little bit um we'll siph in some experience
4:18:11
here too well see what Bulldog can make of this situation you can see already the
4:18:17
minions getting a little bit frustrated as Life coming on over to try and make Gideon's life as difficult as possible
4:18:22
shakes hands with the gromp Gideon will be fine it was always going to be a lane swap with the kalista
4:18:28
you have to imagine right like I mentioned the the stacking of the Waves the DI but they picked Wukong um and
4:18:34
you're like no you know I'm just I'm just not going to deal with it I think dnf realized too like that's probably going to be a lane swap we don't need
4:18:40
this to get a jungler that can dive cuz there just going to be a Jace down here in the bottom Lane and that's what it is
4:18:46
so far gets level two off of siphoning some of that experience in mid lane so he won't be do for anything crazy like
4:18:51
that is going to catch what minions he can here so already a little bit of an advantage over Dudu will also catch that
4:18:57
wave top side and uh plate does go down here in this bottom Lane as well life
4:19:02
taking the demolish just to make sure that they can get some extra value if indeed there was a lane swap to come through so that works out quite
4:19:08
nicely's finally going to get down here I was a little bit worried because you you know I'm I still have the mindset of
4:19:14
the previous year um when lens was a little bit late on The Recoil but it didn't matter because it's so scary to
4:19:21
die of turrets so they didn't need to worry about that one too much as some snowballs being thrown around here by J
4:19:26
I still think that the water balloons are the best but snowballs you know it's nice for a change it's all a theme for
4:19:32
uh what this winter has looked like in Korea this year very true I guess snowy yeah started off like
4:19:40
really warm and then suddenly got really cold now it's kind of warmed up a little bit5 at the moment yeah which is warm
4:19:46
compared to what it can be yeah what it usually is I would say it's pretty warm I might be driving to work next
4:19:52
week as uh yeah so far you know it's just been solo G on the top side the H
4:19:59
is not with him so kind of an unusual setup here land swap as Gideon's coming
4:20:04
over level four yeah going to be out to get that shuriken back lit and the Flash out makes sure that they do not get that
4:20:10
onew punch plus the permafrost which could have spelled the end of bulldog there if he didn't
4:20:16
flash still good investment Dudu is really taking a lot of damage here good
4:20:21
old zigs who uses the Satchel aggressively I imagine Orcs was a little
4:20:26
bit shocked and upset was okay yeah just pushing him and trying to deny him some Farm I think it
4:20:32
denied him one CS there if I saw correctly but he's just trying to put the pressure on with the range Advantage
4:20:38
but he's now out of Mana luckily because he Z he took teleport so can just head
4:20:44
back to whatever Lane he chooses you can see already kingan is heading top side so looks like we're just going to have a swap back at the back timing here it's
4:20:50
actually pretty perfectly synced up here for J because he runs out of Mana right when Berserker is backing so he can go
4:20:55
to the bottom Lane and kingan can get back to the top side not losing anything here so this early game pretty well
4:21:01
piloted actually by Nim so far you can see a significant gold Advantage for G and he skipped the kalista aspect of
4:21:07
this entirely yeah he not doing too badly just trying to get through it is
4:21:14
sort of the aim of the game here on the Nong shim side so avoiding Berserker and life as much as possible sounds good as
4:21:20
Cannon unfortunately not going to be picked up here by the new uh freaks
4:21:25
bottom laner but it'll be all right get the experience for it at least see what else he can do after Lane
4:21:33
swapped away from the hardest part oh life making his way in there's the flash handshake gets the flash out of fer
4:21:39
immediately as in fact it wasn't I think he had the the handshake yeah they're towards the end so just going for the
4:21:46
flash Logistics program or protocol whichever one it is it's named very weirdly that ability loyalty program I
4:21:52
think loyalty program yeah it's one of those it's it doesn't really make sense for a projectile that Shields you yeah
4:21:57
well I mean it's like I'm loyal to my 80 carry I shielded them ah I think um well
4:22:05
here's that teleport here now to the Top Lane for Fisher as we're just kind of
4:22:11
doing a revolving door Lane situation kind of like what we saw Ines up a little bit where doesn't really matter
4:22:16
where you're swapping like the zigs can go mid and we Champion somewhere yeah
4:22:22
just get the farm where you can get it Z is just going to be moving to the mid lane now feels a little bit early
4:22:28
for that sort of swap but that is where we're at if you can be the first one to swap you can control Temple a lot like
4:22:34
this as you can see in the bottom Lane like kinging gets there first still has his teleport is pushing on the bulldog has to catch the wave so he actually
4:22:40
gets first roam um so they're setting the tempo it's going to help them uh secure these first few grubs or at least
4:22:46
the very first one as they have the positional Advantage right now JW has old yeah not going to quite find J there
4:22:52
who is able to get himself out of the way that is two grubs going on over to Nim I don't think they're going to be able to get the feet of strength points
4:22:58
here as pik's able to Smite away one of them so no one with any feet just yet
4:23:04
well you know you know what I mean feat yeah feat featuring two grubs not three
4:23:10
um yeah which is unfortunately featuring nothing um again though you could see like they
4:23:16
got two out of three um you know kingan had the faster Ro was able to get out of
4:23:22
that lane faster now gets the faster return is going to catch that wave and these are you know the small advantage
4:23:28
that could stack up you know if we see a bigger commitment see if they are able to punish kingan for this it doesn't
4:23:34
look like that will be the case nope he's going back by the look of those
4:23:39
items not sure exactly what's going to happen here is it going to be the fimble witer is it going to be the man immune uh yeah we don't know yet yeah he did go
4:23:46
for grasp so I'm leading towards the tank build yes I'm uh you know we just saw a lot of yeah no it's happening it's
4:23:53
happening again yeah um just seems to be the agreed upon way to play Jace I think
4:23:58
that's all right I think in this game though it's definitely a much better situation for the Jace um he still has
4:24:04
to go through an ambessa and a Wukong but it's not quite the uh Cante scarner
4:24:10
level of uh tanks he has to break through so makes a little bit more sense in this particular game the setup of the
4:24:17
draft and I mean he has a slight lead here in the bottom Lane he's going to be able or in the top matchup I should say
4:24:23
but while he's in the bottom Lane he's catching a lot of these minions here um and I don't know like where Gio's going
4:24:31
to strike first in terms of trying to grab some early gold on the zigs because they got a Tempo Advantage but it hasn't
4:24:36
really led to putting him in a position to where he can like start uh using his passive to take turret plates off the or
4:24:42
anything like that this is not the same sort of snowb zigs we saw with successful Lane swaps last year true um
4:24:49
wol yeah do you think we're going to get a ruinous oton this game I'm leaning
4:24:54
towards no like if I had not the time yeah if I had to um pick where one of
4:25:00
the two would go this week out of the 10 uh 10 series I'm thinking this one isn't going to be it so far uh-huh in my
4:25:07
professional opinion all right I appreciate that I needed a professional opinion cuz I wasn't quite sure myself
4:25:12
uh King's moving back towards the top side looks like the dragon is going to be successfully secured here by uh the
4:25:19
DN freaks they are going to be able to grab that one next one going to be an infernal so the really cool Soul
4:25:25
percentage chance is quite low yeah but really cool individual Dres are
4:25:31
guaranteed indeed useful stats hey maybe if it in is end up being ruinous and they get those extra Buffs you know oh
4:25:38
true that'll be super relevant we got a lot of killing to go before then but who knows yeah well it is uh we're going to need
4:25:45
yeah 25 kills or something in the next 5 minutes uh probably not quite that much
4:25:51
that would be a lot or at least yeah maybe probably 30 actually like cuz I don't even know what the Damage Done
4:25:56
chart looks like right now but I imagine it's not great because I'm pretty sure it's like it's about like the amount of
4:26:02
fighting of any kind it's not necessarily just kills not 100% sure about how it uh really works but things
4:26:09
aren't great as now fer and Bulldog doing some battle between one another the that Q is not going to quite Find the Mark okay
4:26:17
um I I do think the damage Champions so far in this game has been quite low but
4:26:22
you can see gu is trying to shore some of that up a little bit here with some qes being lobbed in the general see one
4:26:28
of the bombs got blown up you know yeah beautiful um once again Bulldog
4:26:36
returning to Lane King in crashes a wave some minions lost but not so many that it makes a big difference here we're uh
4:26:43
you know trading mid lane waves here for 80 carries grubs grubs are up soon wolf
4:26:50
all right I don't think a is probably really unhappy about that speci I don't know what that one was trying to he's like trying to spot the ward like no it
4:26:56
doesn't show you the war yeah well land is at least there to try and add some protection so maybe we're not as upset
4:27:02
about the whole situation as P started this one up of course remember thean freaks do have themselves one of these
4:27:09
objectives already needing only a couple more so if they get all three of these grubs not only is that void M available
4:27:15
but that uh is another feet of strength which means that we're getting closer and closer to having feet which is and a
4:27:21
fight here comes kingan all right Bulldog making his way over on a flank angle that is an immediate cleanse from
4:27:27
Berserker but now he's got even more issues he does try and get himself out of the way but that is First Blood going
4:27:32
over to the zigs the Cyclones doing a whole bunch of work though as the akali's on the board lens with that
4:27:38
level six but into the back line goes doo lens still keeping himself alive but can dudo say the same thing the answer
4:27:44
is yes he was bailed out didn't even need it as Gideon's going to bite the dust and Bulldog sitting on two to start
4:27:51
this one off really huge play here for Bulldog picks up a ton of money already
4:27:57
was ahead of his counterpart in fer as Fisher's been kind of trying to clean up the map a little bit here but now it
4:28:03
finds himself over 1,000 gold the advantage and a lot of this fight was really decided by pik's fantastic ult
4:28:10
straight through the center of everybody lot of resources used on possibly going to do it again F has
4:28:16
to flash and Al and press every button that he has and he just teleported down there oh dear dudo is going to suffer
4:28:22
the same fate but he's going to die that is a solo kill for King and oh man we
4:28:28
getting World form King in here today it's looking like it I feel like is that our first solo kill of the whole day it
4:28:36
might have be there might have been a weird solo killer I mean in terms of like a laning early you know early yeah yeah yeah I it's our first sub 15
4:28:43
minutes Sol the kill 100% yeah well that's a nice trade back and they need it pretty desperately because it's a
4:28:48
collie that has its first item online super early sub 12 minutes good old sub
4:28:54
12 minute storm surge storm surge at at like 1135 or something like that is uh
4:29:00
quite powerful quite potent so in this fight Berserker is the Target right Gideon goes for the slide and grabs the
4:29:05
cleans K comes over here the kalista is out of the fight but Fisher actually unbinds a really awkward spot here and
4:29:12
the Cyclone is just hitting everybody in this one there's just no damage offered
4:29:17
back and then when we see the followup engage it is just a wash here oh man if Dudu was there just a little bit early
4:29:24
like life's hostile takeover was so good but if you had that public execution right over the top as it was coming
4:29:30
through yeah could have been so much better but still I mean Vegas can't be choose still a great fight here for DM
4:29:35
yeah dud looking kind of uncomfortable on this Champion so far this game really nice shock blast accelerated here by
4:29:41
kingan and just trying to clear the Wave Super far away from the turret there and King's like that's not allowed um I will
4:29:47
kill you and if he doesn't miss the shock blast he does so it's uh Cleaver by the way first okay so that's a lot
4:29:54
more damage I like that I'm into that I think you you're still allowed maybe what he was doing is like how much can I
4:30:00
snowball and still be relevant if I build a lot more damage or do I have to just try and play the weird sort of uh
4:30:07
tanky build um that we did see come out from Rich and we have seen quite a lot from solar Q recently yeah not entirely
4:30:14
sure see how it goes hosik is the Wukong here of course you do have a decent match up into the sichani we've spoken
4:30:20
about this many times before you get to shred a little bit uh and so you can try and get rid of her a little bit earlier
4:30:25
on but I think Gideon's probably still fine how this one's going especially with the Cs situation is now kingan
4:30:31
could be in trouble the Doo's revenge is Swift and it is dangerous um another Nim
4:30:38
strike does come in and dud dashing around will be a to pick up that kill so it takes them a little bit of time but they do manage to grab that kill in the
4:30:44
end yeah and there's no cross map available the fact that Bulldog is as ahead as he is means he just completely
4:30:50
controls Fisher in the side lane and even though there's a zigs in this game just really has not been getting damaged
4:30:57
onto the structures J unfortunately super unsuccessful in that regard as kingan just comes down here to set up a
4:31:03
ward in the river and is instantly punished by Yosi Cyclone comes out the nimus strike going to close the gap and
4:31:09
Dudu has just too many Dash Y and so that's that I mean as simple as
4:31:15
that you're coming up to see if you can catch him when he's trying to push forward push those advantages further he goes into the river and his Tombstone
4:31:22
was already etched at that moment when he dropped the W love that word etched just feels good I'll try to slide it in
4:31:29
when I can yeah yeah it's a great one absolutely all right Bulldog on a bit of a flank angle poosa gets into the pit
4:31:35
let's see whether he can steal this one away he's done these before but Gideon is going to be able to lock it down but now the perfect execution let's see
4:31:41
whether it's going to work he's straight into prison though not exactly optimal as it's going to be a cloud Soul oh baby
4:31:46
the excitement coming through from every angle but uh not in this team fight because in fact what really wasn't yeah
4:31:51
I mean bulldog Ed straight into an Ting Alis as Len just kind of walks it off it
4:31:57
was almost like a heist here um Gideon comes in secures the dragon and they just High tail it out of there there's
4:32:03
no punish to be seen and I get it for for Bulldog you want to hit any Target you can you want to get some value out
4:32:09
of your storm Razer early and uh not storm Razer um storm surge yeah storm
4:32:14
surge yeah one of those other stormies it's another it's a weather related item yeah um want to get as much value out of
4:32:21
it as you can and try to get something in that fight after you gave Dragon but he's unsuccessful good play from Nim
4:32:27
yeah this could be uh some feet of strength here for piosik he's able to
4:32:32
take this one down lens and Gideon wanted to do something about it but it is support jungle versus support jungle
4:32:38
with some shellfish in the middle boka going to come on over though and not exactly even this one out there is also
4:32:43
an essor up there so it looks like it is going to be that feet of strength being picked up by dnf so that's one a
4:32:50
piece only a turret remains between these two squads and I'm seeing a zigs yeah that's the thing that's really
4:32:56
scary but consider also that also aald yeah and there's a bottom turret that's very low because of the control Bulldogs
4:33:04
had in that bottom Lane so uh don't count those zigs eggs before they're
4:33:09
hatched those zigs satchels yeah don't count your bombs before they explode yes uh could be some Duds uh so far in terms
4:33:17
of damage to structure has been a bit of a dud for JE in this one even with the lane swap see he's dead even with the
4:33:23
kalista at this point in time and it's really the aalii that's the biggest problem for Nim when you look at the
4:33:30
Gold where that Herald goes though anybody's guess for now Wukong looking to head towards the bottom side of the
4:33:36
map and take out that weaken turret I mentioned uh before so what it looks like we're going to see yeah I actually
4:33:41
think that if he does just go down there race though yeah yeah this is this is really dangerous pios needs to get this
4:33:47
down no no no it's done yeah King is going to be out to take it the power of Jace will grab that first turret blood
4:33:53
and I think that's a blunder here for dnf I just I mean CU they had the herald yeah they had the herald so early at
4:33:59
least they're going to be able to get some damage onto this inner but that speeds the strength over the Noam great reaction from kingan he has demolished
4:34:06
he's Jace as you mentioned so he can press W and shoot real fast and that's exactly what he did and there was just
4:34:11
no answer there on the top side and the positioning of poos man he had to travel so far to set up the herald drop in
4:34:17
bottom Lane it wasn't an option mid because the mid turret's super healthy and there's a zigs with insane wave
4:34:23
clear that was in control there on top side didn't have control either so I think bot maybe they realized was their
4:34:28
best option a little bit too late had they been faster towards it perhaps they could have won out that race but yeah or
4:34:33
just throwing at Top Lane right uh kept kinging down uh as lens going to be out
4:34:39
to spot out pooshi gets that flash head about not exactly early enough though the warrior trick are going to come on
4:34:44
through and there's the handshake lens may just be dead here does heal trying to keep himself healthy The Bouncing
4:34:49
bombs and all of these minefields are real dangerous as the ulti not necessarily working Dudu dashing around
4:34:55
this fight they've got him right where they want him kinging going to be going down first as Bulldog diving forward
4:35:00
land's going to get Knocked Up In fact there's a triple the Hostile take over from Life on to everyone Fisher trying
4:35:07
to keep them into position but now it's Dudu looking to try and tidy this one and I think he's got the dashes to do it
4:35:13
at least the dashes to get towards the turret here Gideon going to be a to get away as is fer but it's a one fight for
4:35:20
dnf it's a huge win for dnf Berserker is trying to chase down fiser
4:35:26
here but isn't quite able to keep up with him at this stage in the game um perhaps with a few more of those Cloud
4:35:31
draks he'd have a better chance but either way is going to be able to crash his wave and will force a Teleport out
4:35:37
of fer does get back to get it well watch this old transpire here on the bottom lane or towards the bottom Lane
4:35:43
where lens actually wants to make a play here onto a Wukong just simply War trickst her away the followup just isn't
4:35:49
there it's quite a bizarre play here un really wanted to headbutt him back but something stopped him from being able to
4:35:54
get the right angle or something well even even if he does get the head butut the warrior trickster likely gets him out right and he had so it's just a
4:36:01
really bizarre call here for l a snap call to go for that one they didn't have enough control here they needed a lot more time and then the flash engage here
4:36:09
from life as you mentioned is just beautiful the Berserker comes over here and he's like if you guys want to stay
4:36:14
here and die be my guest uh and yeah L's Alis we've seen
4:36:21
the most incredible plays on him and sometimes you leave yourself a little bit head scratching face famine yeah it
4:36:28
is a bit of that oh it's voracious who would have thought as yeah
4:36:33
aon's been there for about 10 seconds see where the Nong shim are going to be starting this one up could be very dangerous and so fish is just going to
4:36:40
walk past and look for a minion wave won't be a to find it there's now a bulldog into some Mist here and Gideon
4:36:46
says I don't care he just gets himself out of the way understandable as well understandable have a nice day yeah um
4:36:53
I'm trying to figure out the ways in which Nim can start to win a team fight here because you know we talked about
4:37:01
how dnf need to snowball this game they've done a great job of it I mean I think this is about as ideal as it gets
4:37:07
I mean the aalii is massively ahead the ambessa was put behind early only slightly um and she still has two kills
4:37:14
like she's still very relevant in this game and they have been able to successfully set up really nice combos
4:37:19
with the Wukong with the ranata there's a lot of AOE here there's a lot of uh targets that are vulnerable like the
4:37:26
Jace in the backline who is going for the moram a second here um so he's not
4:37:31
going tank he's going to be very vulnerable like GI is he's a real Jace and neither of them have flash so some
4:37:37
things you have to consider enim really need to slow this game down somehow getting a dragon would certainly help yep Aon would also
4:37:45
help you could say especially for being able to get some of these Dives to happen it's interesting how we've seen
4:37:51
the Third Dragon sometimes go kind of unattended for a while because Aon is on the top side of the map really keeping
4:37:57
everybody kind of like on their toes like ooh do we really have enough time to take dragon and in this case I think they have enough information and um and
4:38:05
enough control over the top side where they actually can take the dragon then regroup here Noam just won't be able to
4:38:10
to take this fast enough at this stage of the game so they do their due diligence check it out set up Vision
4:38:16
then take the dragon and will now rotate back over D is trying to get a little bit of space here with this mid lane as
4:38:24
the ulti does come through bulldog looking to make his way up as life could be in trouble but instead they turn their attention towards the aalii who
4:38:32
going to be able to flash out of the way and oh no there's the mega Inferno bomb and it grabs two with the help of King
4:38:38
and shock blast it looked like he'd almost made the great uh The Great Escape but instead he was dead that is
4:38:45
going to be atakan taken here for Nong shim as well they got some Feats of Strength in their back pocket look like
4:38:51
they're on their heels in this game that is going to be a large amount of value that they'll be able to pick up although
4:38:57
they're not going to have their mid outter turret no certainly not I mean that's the consolation prize here for
4:39:03
dnf after this exchange but picking up Aon is going to feel nice it's not a composition that necessarily utilizes
4:39:09
the uh withdraw as well as some of the other comps but can give you some added safety and when you have the Yon you
4:39:15
know you're feeling like okay maybe this is my opportunity to really go in and make a big play here that was bizarre
4:39:21
yeah K actually teleported Top Lane instead of just backing you know he could have just said well I've got the
4:39:26
verious out of I don't care yeah he didn't want to waste it so this is you know a Fisher setting up a pick here and
4:39:33
the the team just faster to group punishing the fact that dnf were taking dragon on the other side of the map
4:39:39
bulldog with some cool plays here but ultimately just tosses his flash away and will end up dying anyways but that
4:39:45
was a really nice punish from Nim to set a trap there knowing that dnf were mostly on the other side of the map
4:39:51
setting up for Dragon so gets them the oton and let's see how to utilize this withdraw yeah it's working out quite
4:39:58
well so far at least for creating pressure around the map see whether they do do the thing where they'll just throw
4:40:04
their bodies underneath the turret to see whether they can get something as that is going to be a cyclone utilized fish are actually allowed to escape you
4:40:10
saw Yos move out of the way there um so not wanting to overly commit onto the Y
4:40:17
as there's a shuriken back flip I think he's going to have to take a bit of a recall here and there he goes so they
4:40:23
get rid of one of them yeah he does have teleport see if he wants to just head to
4:40:28
the Top Lane or if he's just 40 gold in a blood pedal in exchange for an out of turret W yeah not great um the trade
4:40:36
deal Mee oh wait two turrets actually yeah I receive
4:40:42
it's uh this deal keeps getting worse all the time Lando Lando got something to say about that man oh well this is
4:40:50
actually maybe three turrets Atlas well there's the glacial prison going wide let's see where the life can actually
4:40:55
find an angle here he just gets knocked up immediately but he's pretty tanky okay they're sending him all home it
4:41:01
looks like Gideon wants to go home as well he's like damn I'm so tanky but uh yeah they're all just going to go for a bit of a four turrets Atlas yeah um so
4:41:09
they throw themselves all at an inhibitor turret and uh successfully not
4:41:14
die but die yeah it's beautifully done it's a nice withdraw um Retreat uh after
4:41:21
killing three turrets now the inhibitor is open H is going to TP to the mid lane
4:41:27
oh leen's going to get the flash out of berserker has to invest his own as now Fisher looking for a bit of an angle of
4:41:32
kosi he's going to come down life not going to quite find it because fish is able to flash his way out of there has
4:41:38
dudo also dancing around this fight that hostile take over was not the one that life was looking for and pososi cannot
4:41:44
find the reset on the bailout and so he's going to hit the deck as well and
4:41:50
it's 25 and 1 half minutes that means The Baron's up and available and there is no jungler on dnf this is a bizarre
4:41:56
situation four teleports uh I believe in total committed to that mid lane fight
4:42:01
but Nim getting the jump on them having those set up first end up winning out
4:42:06
some low health bars means no Baron off the play but it's gu and Fisher who teleport here to kind of flank Berserker
4:42:13
and trap him sandwich him here in the mid lane and he's the first Target they find see Fisher's forced to then flash
4:42:20
here Bulldog shows up but there's not a great Target for this aalii and fosik is the one who actually ends up getting
4:42:26
punished here trying to keep Berserker alive and set him up to do that damage with the bailout he's almost able to get
4:42:31
something done there but not quite enough but does enough damage to her like I said the baron is denied a lot of
4:42:37
teleports are down but it doesn't necessarily look like it's going to matter in in this case is this game went
4:42:43
from having very little action to almost no time to breathe yeah um although 12
4:42:49
kills in 26 and 1/2 minutes isn't necessarily the most high octane League of Legends that we've seen but I'm glad
4:42:55
that it is at least picking up some Pace um I did like so I in the team fight was
4:43:01
like life's hostile takeover wasn't great in that moment I actually thought for the disengage upon the rewatch I
4:43:08
like unfortunately pios had already taken way too much damage and so it wasn't actually able to out so
4:43:13
I think I'm still definitely feeling good about the life R situation that we are seeing here I mean the tier three
4:43:20
boots have been done for J for a while he actually had top damage on the rift was shown just a moment ago the zigs was
4:43:26
a bit of a slow starter compared to a lot of the time what we've seen from zigs in the lck where he gets a ton of plates and or turrets early and is set
4:43:33
up that way he kind of has to build his own uh game this time around he's significantly behind in terms of Cs on
4:43:39
this kalista um but now with three kills actually takes a lead for the first time uh for Horizon Focus been done for a
4:43:46
while he is a big Mage uh big awesome dude and if he set up well here I mean
4:43:51
this is the scaling we've talked about for Nim super low range are dnf and you can teleport flank them you can trap
4:43:57
them you can set up a lot of scenarios where it's really uncomfortable for this kalista oh ulti going to come through here from fer really nicely picking out
4:44:05
Bulldog here even though he's in his shroud as that was a weird flash but it actually worked the sure back flip
4:44:11
keeping him alive for so long but there are a lot of bad guys in that area and it is going to be J that's able to lock
4:44:17
down that kill in the end I like the fancy footwork from Bulldog however he he still died so unfortunately it was
4:44:24
Port yeah second time for him unfortunately he's flashed to nearly live and then is killed by Bulldog a
4:44:31
moment later uh Bulldog now sorry not by Bulldog by jiu um du now has four kills
4:44:37
and they have their eyes on this bar the vision here they decide better of it as
4:44:43
Bulldog is respawning shortly I just feel like the location of the money is a
4:44:48
problem because J is well it's everywhere now he is the guy there it is also kind of everywhere you're right um
4:44:54
but the fact that suani doesn't have a big lead or something like that who cares yeah I mean it's it's a good point that you make though because earlier on
4:45:01
in the game it was a 1,100 I think which even got higher to like 1.4k lead for Bulldog he's now significantly behind
4:45:07
over this y he's been shut down really well they've done such a good job two levels behind they keep pulling him out
4:45:14
of these side Lanes uh which has been where he's found a lot of success where he put a lot of that pressure onto the bottom turret right and taking the col
4:45:22
off the map consistently really hurts her Spike that she had so early I mean she's just unfortunately not able to
4:45:27
make a big impact in this game anymore and now the Y is a big threat the zigs is fully online Shadow flame is done and
4:45:34
I mean n are just going come at me cuz you can't reach yeah and this is the problem that they were going to run into
4:45:41
right like the severe out ranging of nim is certainly a factor and dnf I think
4:45:46
they need to really hard commit on their opportunities if they can find them and
4:45:51
right now they haven't even been looking is what it feels like to me a lot of this game is going to come down to I
4:45:57
think for dnf now changing how they approach these fights cuz they've been trying to set up Berserker a lot he's on three items but I think they're going to
4:46:03
have to have a big flank from Dudu uh to really find success finding GI in the backline OR finding kingan is your best
4:46:10
path to success and I ideally je because he's really the one who's doing a majority of this damage he has flash right now though he has Satchel charge
4:46:16
he's just so difficult to lock down he's got lens as a bodyguard as well and I mean if you guys want to see how these
4:46:22
fights are going to work or potentially not work for dnf keep your eyes on Berserker on a lot of these team fights
4:46:27
see how many Autos he can actually get off it's not his fault or anything like that but he just is severely out ranged
4:46:33
and on three items as kalista when you have a massive lead you can do almost no wrong you just kind of run at them but
4:46:38
in this game where you're 1,000 gold behind the such a small Goldie but like you mentioned big Champions the zigs the
4:46:44
Yon online now the Jace has a ton of money where do you break through like what's the front line that you're
4:46:50
hitting you just can't quite reach by the time you're going in a lot of your front line is at half health because zigs has tossed a few bombs in and you
4:46:56
find yourself on the back foot we need pool base strategies the flanks have to be amazing or they catch Gideon out just
4:47:04
in the uh in the river but that doesn't actually happen Fisher going to be able to get himself back to his soul or body
4:47:11
that was Soul doing the fighting prior wasn't it yes uh but long I don't think are too
4:47:17
worried about how this game is going as far as scaling is concerned certainly doing wellish does take a little bit of
4:47:24
poke level 16 hit by Berserker here level 16 on J as well feels a whole lot worse um just with the fact that that
4:47:31
Mega Inferno bomb is going to be doing so much damage yeah especially with the items he's put together got an oblivion
4:47:36
orb now as well I do like that uh Tech from him a armu guard is picked up for
4:47:42
bulldog and with that armu guard setup I mean it might allow him to get into the back line a little bit better try to
4:47:48
kill J that's the game plan pios on the flank spotted yeah completely seen
4:47:54
that's going to be taken away fer is going to unbind the soul but as we know
4:47:59
uh P should so there we go they're just pushing the jungler out of the
4:48:05
area see life looking for an opportunity finds a handshake onto Gideon Berserker finally being able to actually do
4:48:10
something but unfortunately life can't quite get that fat call to go far enough and fer really needs like an extra
4:48:17
couple of teos on that Q to start hitting a few more of them and now bizer could take matters into his own hands I
4:48:22
don't know about this one however he is able to flash his way out the bail out's going to come on through does he have
4:48:28
the ren available he does not L gets a three-man knockup with that pulverize it's gorgeous and Nong shim now just
4:48:34
take the ad8 carry and they'll go about their merry way yeah remember in his interview earlier okay hold up life yeah
4:48:42
may just be not long for this world or perhaps with the cloud oh
4:48:47
oh Sentinel yeah he's on his team you in the interview earlier Berserker was like
4:48:53
I used to kind of make dumb aggressive moves but now I'm a smart player that did look a little bit like a tale of
4:48:59
frustration it it was it looked a little bit dumb at first but that's the kind of issue I was talking about you got to close the gap somehow he knows he has
4:49:05
bailout and I think that was the closest to a successful fight he was ever going to get he was like I'm taking this game into my hands and it almost was able to
4:49:12
to set them up a pick right it was fairly close but you can just see the problems of the composition in that
4:49:18
moment encapsulated his attempt there to to kind of just kamakazi his way through
4:49:24
but he is unsuccessful and that's a baron nor so watch this again like Berserker is just like okay he's going
4:49:29
to have to rebind I have an opportunity to Marshall pose off these minions here this is unfortunately the queue but when
4:49:35
this bailout comes through he's actually so close to getting this off on the
4:49:40
Gideon forces a flash out of him but I mean that that was about as good as we going to get everyone else is trying to fall up lens denies anyone getting in
4:49:48
there and bulock just can't hit anybody I mean it's a tank that was being hit there by Berserker so it's not like Bullock's going to go in there and blow
4:49:54
him up instantly it was too far away but I don't think it was the right call at the end of the day but you can see his
4:49:59
thought process there unfortunately just not successful and this composition has really reached its Twilight point I
4:50:05
think it's what it's kind of feeling like and Nim now with this Baron buff
4:50:11
now pressing down towards this inner turret on the bottom side inner on the top side of the map still up and available as well but it is a bare
4:50:18
inhibitor in the mid lanane so Nim can get two right here as Berserker taking
4:50:24
so much damage there's the glacial prison knockups are coming through though the Hostile takeover is so good and Berserker keeps himself alive they
4:50:31
take down the turet is now Dudu getting into that backline he flashes on top of CH that is so much money and Dudu may
4:50:37
have just saved it for the DN freaks King and going to be going down he cannot stand against five of them as
4:50:45
lens yeah headb p in his way to relative safety but he is the last man there kind
4:50:50
of like a mage blinking out of the dungeon he will survive but the rest of his team not there nope L will get away
4:50:58
and push that midwave but they weren't going to push to to hit mid they're now grouped on the bottom they want that inhibitor which is open and the play
4:51:06
here you know for Nim you you can see the concept of it right but unfortunately this ult doesn't really do
4:51:13
enough to Berserker by fer he's punished and taken out and then it's just a field day for dudo who's able to get to the
4:51:18
back line Satchel isn't enough he's able to flash on top of him and take out J and that's the damage gone here
4:51:25
completely as kingan can do little but look on alone as a Jace you need setup he did not have it his whole team fell
4:51:31
around uh him but that was a big big attempt from fer to get that backline
4:51:37
access to kill Berserker and to then follow up and win but a swing of gold as you can see as well the Red Bull Baron
4:51:43
power play for the DN freaks 2.2k not bad at all and they didn't even get the
4:51:50
baron so that is the turnaround and once again I want to bring up the fact that I think there's too many comeback
4:51:55
mechanics in this game of League of Legends W because it really did feel like Nong shim had a great game State no
4:52:01
I think this is fantastic what we've seen so far in both of our series is that it ain't over you still have to
4:52:06
play well in order to close these ones out absolutely and when come back to the range conversation
4:52:11
uh let's just say Nim especially fer um shortened the range between the T
4:52:17
Freaks and himself uh in that last play trying to make the aggressive uh setup
4:52:22
to grab an inhibitor if he gets that pick and they're successful with that play and G's bomb is more well timed
4:52:28
with him instead of being used so early maybe they're the ones walking away with an inhibitor at worst case scenario
4:52:33
perhaps even the win in the game itself but that overextension gives DM uh freaks a window back into this game
4:52:40
we're sitting at Cloud Soul point for them so that would be a huge Bo for them if they're able to get it especially
4:52:45
when you consider how well the Champions on their squad use it the ambessa that's always trying to close the gap the
4:52:51
Wukong that's going to be Ting and and running at you I mean it's actually incredible for this composition for them so if they could stick it out for 90
4:52:57
more seconds here they weren't able to get any Inhibitors off of that play but they delete the baron and they're in a
4:53:02
position now to where maybe they could get control maybe that cloud soul is enough to keep this composition relevant
4:53:09
for just a little bit longer I mean this is is our longest game of the day as well that we're approaching here 37 minutes and I think we've got a little
4:53:15
bit left to go and alost one was like really really long as well um but I think it was over in another 5 minutes
4:53:22
or something like that and we were heading towards like Baron number three and elders and things like this it was absolutely obscene and so now we're
4:53:29
still waiting on a soul 50 seconds until that cloud is going to be up and available DN freaks if they do get that
4:53:35
I think it really does spell a big turn right that extra movement speed like this whole composition is built around
4:53:41
kill J get on top of him and kill him and if you move faster you can do that faster and just completed his merel
4:53:50
Amicon so doesn't have a death cap but that'll be the last step if he does finish his build here right now holding
4:53:56
on to that control W in that last spot as vision is going to be so critical you can see every inventory is has got one
4:54:01
basically a few exceptions here life in trouble yeah could be although it does
4:54:06
look like he's posturing aggressively you can kind of feel it the bouncing bomb doing a little bit here as King in
4:54:13
also off to the side really wanting to create a fish in a barrel scenario man how did no one get hit by that kind of
4:54:19
crazy Berserker going in again all right King could be in trouble me Inferno not really doing too much as they take down
4:54:25
the Jace D just trying to get himself alive Bulldog diving into the back line as well the flash on top of the zigs and
4:54:31
the main man is down it's now Fisher that's in trouble as he has created enough space to knockups are good from
4:54:37
lens but they've lost all the damage and Berserker is still on full health
4:54:43
this guy's a Madman as Bulldog get on in there he should be able to take down fer here finding the fivepoint strikes and
4:54:49
unfortunately that Soul has to rebind even goes golden to get the style points bazer is going to grab himself a cloud
4:54:55
soul and this game is back around again yeah now there's no wav set up here for them to just rush down and start pushing
4:55:02
to to end the game or even to threaten an inhibitor just yet 50 seconds on fer though means that they will be
4:55:08
definitely looking for that as soon as they grab this bear and they grab grab Cloud Soul we talked about how important that is with the movement speed the
4:55:13
baron will allow them to even though they don't have great Siege and great range do a lot with this now this is another exact same situation what preser
4:55:20
did last time and if you're looking at that last fight going man this guy is is crazy like he's lost his mind like what
4:55:26
is he doing you can see how it works in a practical situation here where Wukong also helps him peel or helps peel for
4:55:32
him as he kind of tights towards the rest of the team he has no fear he knows how kalista works and when he's got a
4:55:38
rata attached to him and he's got this many items he just can do almost no wrong yeah that's bar it's so
4:55:45
beautifully done because there was no counterplay to that just none at all and he identified the fact that if we get
4:55:51
kingan on his own he's got Jack I've got I've got all of my things you will die even if you try and kill me I'll get
4:55:57
bailed out and you'll be dead he's super smart and this build is creative and maybe he was right I I really just think
4:56:04
like I gave him credit for like what what we thought maybe could work in the last fight but you can see in practice
4:56:10
here and I think people who were calling him out after the last one probably pretty quiet right now yeah I know I I I
4:56:16
love it because it's like this is what I meant by the way guys so we get the the confirmation that yeah know this is actually how this one works and I mean
4:56:24
he's he's had a a really high impact game here and he's never been afraid his
4:56:29
positioning has been aggressive and the man is just making waves in this one and now again this composition has a second
4:56:35
or third or maybe is it fourth now least on life at least um and with the baron buff they need to
4:56:42
crack the Inhibitors though they need to utilize this Baron buff to get this base open cuz they might not get another
4:56:47
chance at this well let's see how this one goes as life is going to join Berserker once again he's just buffing
4:56:53
up these minions sending them towards these turrets kingan finishes hole breaker so it's looking to be a bit of a
4:56:59
side lane threat himself yeah Gideon has got a large Helper but they seem to be getting through it as Fisher looking for
4:57:06
an opportunity but he's going to have to rebind so he does get back there a lot of pings towards do they they just not
4:57:12
they're not getting the inhibitor I mean they really need it so badly to set up this elder fight okay maybe there's a
4:57:17
chance here now on the bottom Lane but the team is not set up for this yeah still one and a half minutes as the ulti
4:57:23
comes through from fer but he's not able to lock onto Berserker here gets out of the way I don't know if
4:57:28
they're going to get it I mean they're going to get this mid turret at least that's gold but more than gold they need Super minions here I feel it's not
4:57:35
impossible to win if they don't get one but it would be so huge for them if they could secure it
4:57:40
yeah I think that like being able to break up the Nim composition right like so that they can't just bear down on you
4:57:46
with all their range I agree with you still I think that the amount of power
4:57:51
wrestled back here by DN dnf has been so good and they have the cloud Soul so triple cloud like they are running real
4:57:58
quick yeah Gio's wave clear is really making this so much easier for Nim to deal with and you know you can see he's
4:58:05
actually opting for void staff here as his final item rather than death death cap just because of the tankiness that
4:58:12
started to kind of acre here we are in Supreme Lake game right now so I think it's a wise choice you can see Berserker
4:58:17
is actually almost matched him a damage on a kalista that could barely reach that's insane uh I I I look at this
4:58:23
situation now as this game is probably going to come down to whether or not dnf can set up a fight and kill J or
4:58:30
Berserker can find that angle and get empowered once again to just blow up the front line while pososi keeps the other
4:58:36
players at Bay just like they did in that last dragon fight cuz it's it's it's not impossible by any means but Nim
4:58:42
the the scary part of this late game the first real scary part is over they weathered the storm they didn't lose any
4:58:47
inhibitor turrets even so it's an honest 5v5 yeah straight up yep and if they win
4:58:54
it they get Baron as well and so I mean it's likely game off the back of this
4:58:59
next team fight it's about how decisive dnf are going to be is Berserker going to be able to find that angle yet again
4:59:05
because he's got two extra lives he's got bailout and he's got G yeah
4:59:10
you lose a lot of steam when the ga is activated of course because you're in stasis and your team needs that damage
4:59:17
in that moment but there's a world where it could actually be super huge for him oh yeah um especially with how CH this
4:59:23
game has been the way the damage threats work for no shim I think for Nim ideally you want to be landing some poke before
4:59:29
Berserker gets anywhere near you you want to be utilizing that range of Edge and they are just going to hard camp
4:59:35
this elder early look at all the vision they're setting up they're trying to set up traps here and get every every single entry point set this opens up an
4:59:42
opportunity for dnf to try to S Side Lane here but kind of seen it every turn yeah I like Dudu heading up there and
4:59:49
threatening this side lane going to be able to probably take this one down he's got AIT bit of damage but instead going
4:59:56
to respect the fact that Nim could be lying in weight this game is so interesting because mean the drafts we talked about it from you know second one
5:00:03
of the game how they're so different and how they do totally different things but in this situation dnf they have you know
5:00:10
some sideling threats but it's not enough to go over and actually threaten an inhibitor after that Baron is gone
5:00:15
and that's why I was really harping on I really think they need to get this inhibitor now because no are like M you
5:00:21
could silent but you won't you know you could threaten my inhibitor but you won't we have two TS and we're just
5:00:26
going to set up a vision at every single entry point to this dragon Elder dragon's up in 38 seconds they're just
5:00:32
going to Camp it and say eventually you have to come to us you can't shoot far 7,000 more item value on the side of dnf
5:00:38
fresh off a back n haven't quite gone for a reset yet there is 27 seconds on the clock I don't think
5:00:44
they're going to be able to I think they just really want to have PR more than anything else yeah makes sense well the
5:00:50
hand's looking for a little bit of an angle here we'll see whether they do find anyone as pososi Creeps in to the brush o Berserker getting dangerously
5:00:57
close to kalista Auto Range Champions yeah banana brush so important here as
5:01:03
fer is going to unbind to the soul doesn't pull the trigger on an ulti or anything like that we've still got Flash's Galore across the rift and the
5:01:10
Elder is on the map all right there's the flash Cyclone right on top of jiu he's going to have to flash to get himself out of there now Gideon all on
5:01:17
his Lonesome but uh he's real tanky going to be able to survive at least for now 2K damage here for Berserker to
5:01:23
start this one off and they've started the Elder do having blue buff here from that Global blue is actually super huge
5:01:29
for him as well look at this from Bulldog this is real scary they've turned on him immediately he can go into
5:01:34
the Shroud but he's almost just dead but into the back line goes dooo he's headbutted out of there but everyone is
5:01:41
just piling on top the Hostile take over doesn't do enough but it does something
5:01:46
and dnf are just going to be flashing after them King and looking to go down and we thought that this was in the bag
5:01:52
for Nong shim and dnf said now hold my bail out we're going to kill you all
5:01:59
everything put into G there and it looked like maybe he was going to be punishing Bulldog but he steps One Step
5:02:06
too far forward he's the one who goes down zerker says I've lost interest in
5:02:11
killing Champions I'm killing the Elder yep and Dudu is just yeah going to be uh trying to take them down in their base
5:02:19
and that is going to be successful first inhibitor going to go down the inhibitor turret and the Nexus turret's going to
5:02:24
be following this dragon is angry and it's hungry and it's not going to be eating more for dinner tonight said it's
5:02:30
going to have to settle for an Nexus and a couple of turrets dnf man what a slobber knocker of a game
5:02:38
and they are going to be the victors here in just game one this was just game one I think this has been the best game
5:02:44
of the tournament so far in terms of entertainment value and the sample size is so much higher than if you had have said that in a previous series if I said
5:02:51
it after game two or three it would have been like w I mean I don't know but we've had some really one-sided games
5:02:58
and our last two have been very close but this was close in a very unique way I think dnf showcasing how smart they
5:03:04
are and how the the flank potential they have with this aalii with this ambessa
5:03:10
the amount of threats for the zigs you have to be able to find that angle you have to be able to have the punish and
5:03:16
it looked for just a split second like maybe bulog had made an error maybe he went too far maybe he actually try
5:03:21
trying to kill J just lost his team the game but his his teammates are ready to follow up and GI was obliterated once he
5:03:28
was gone Berserker didn't even think twice he's like I'm just killing the Elder game this one and uh bker tops the
5:03:35
damage overig he out damages a zig in a 46 minute game take my player of the
5:03:40
match Berserker that was pretty unbelievable this guy keeping himself relevant in one of our longest games of
5:03:46
the season so far and 46 minutes is longer than I was expecting I thought we were going to have like quick fire games
5:03:52
with all of these extra objectives that we have available the fact that things were looking like they were heading in a
5:03:58
snowbally direction this was back and forth and back and forth and thankfully
5:04:03
we've got another one on the table we're not going to see any of these Champions no more of the Berserker kalista this time around um um but man I just want I
5:04:11
want more of that Vibe right it doesn't necessarily have to be the same Champs the same drops just give me those vibes
5:04:17
and I'm so happy time for us to go to a short break when we get back the space going to be breaking that one down and
5:04:23
we will see you for game number two

5:12:00
after that last match the lck is truly back it was a slobber knocker Affair but
5:12:06
the DN freaks get their first Victory on under their new name and are up 1 Z over
5:12:11
Nim red Force welcome back to the space Deon alongside Chronicle noox to break that one down and Ox is Ox is going to
5:12:19
take up a lot of the segment I'm just letting you guys know it's going to happen but you it'll make sense in just
5:12:26
a little bit yeah it will uh if if you've watched the LSK before and you saw that zigel pick you kind of had a
5:12:31
feeling this was coming uh and he told us about 20 minutes in no guys it's overdone I don't want to do a zig
5:12:38
segment I I think you know we've done it too many times but then we got so mad that we're still going to do it but
5:12:43
first let's take a look at some of the other team fights uh because I we don't want to go too crazy on him just yet
5:12:49
because started out very well Nim showing again that OT is insane right
5:12:57
and yes there's a small gold lead here I want you to see what this one buff allows you to do and particularly when
5:13:03
you have a composition with strong s laner like y you have a zigs as well the
5:13:08
tower Tak potentially is huge and the response to a team pushing in Siege and like you have to fight them you don't
5:13:14
want to be fighting against this buff though and they they want to been able to defend their base But ultimately you
5:13:19
don't really gain much other than stop on the push meanwhile Y is pushing in the S Side Lane uh and the cost is just
5:13:25
so much in terms of structures so that's four turrets off of that single play and
5:13:31
in theory I think you look at the composition that was there for DN Freaks and it doesn't necessarily skill poorly
5:13:38
but there's a kalista which is very short range which we saw berser will be able to navigate and then the rest is very uh you need to basically get it
5:13:44
done on your first play when you go in which fortunately for them they were able to because if you don't get top of
5:13:50
that zigs in the long term I think you are going to end up losing out on those fights so that was Four Towers in that
5:13:55
one play this is our fourth match and how many uh ruus aons have we seen
5:14:01
Ox uh we've seen oh H non runas for vicious that's right not going to zero
5:14:09
zero of them Here's the final fight here 45 minutes on in we get to late game this is where Z supposed to do a lot of
5:14:14
damage kalista short range it should be difficult to get in yeah I want you to watch so J look at the aali so they they
5:14:20
decided to try and make a pick on the aali and we we'll watch just track the abilities that g throws this this is
5:14:26
really important to take into account for any zigs players any aspiring zigs players um coming in a second so look
5:14:32
for him the Q goes the E goes that's fine oh the W and you're dead literally like a second later just you know how
5:14:39
how much damage did that W do to aari not much immediately you die and you
5:14:44
know some people might think oh well this is a really hard comp to play into for zigs and I'm going to be honest it's
5:14:49
not that hard It's tricky at times but you outrange everything and your W is such a good safety tool do you know what
5:14:55
happens if a Cari Dives towards you you put the W between you and Ai and you're a mile away afterwards and I was like ox
5:15:02
what if we focus on doooo he had a wonderful game multiple great catches actually think did a really good job us
5:15:09
even more so than yuk who I think had a couple really pop of moments every single fight I think dud was on point with his ultimate absorbing a ton of
5:15:16
pressure uh but as as he naturally does um and and again I want to go back to
5:15:21
the point in time where we thought that we could talk more about other stuff because everything looked so good look
5:15:28
at this bomba Ox you're feeling great this was a point in time where I was happy you know I mean this is what every
5:15:34
zigs player wants th this is this is a fantasy when it comes in you syn up with a teammate
5:15:40
woo now I was a happier man then and and this was the point where I was like no guys we can talk about other stuff uh
5:15:47
and then when we got to the end of the game yeah cuz it was at this point Dan
5:15:53
where you're like you know his build isn't optimal but it's good it's good but not optimal and now time to talk
5:16:00
about it right I said okay like he what's what's wrong with this what isn't you know what it's actually he he ended
5:16:06
up building Moran Amicon it's missing the most egregious part he finished morom before he had void staff where's
5:16:12
the rabbit you never had a rabbit on right if you go LeAndre you try best Wukong even kalista built like a jack
5:16:18
show like the Andre just eclipses every other item like it beats Shadow flame for damage it beats Horizon Focus for
5:16:24
damage you need LeAndre is broken you should have built that but the void stuff came in after romicon and people were like oh zigs does no damage look he
5:16:31
can't that yeah cuz you built terribly that's how it's so e it's also I did go
5:16:36
a presence of mind which he was also uh he didn't even remember to mention but uh it was a personal issue Berserker did
5:16:45
play well his first game back in the lck But Here We Go game number two DN freaks
5:16:50
looking to try and get the win here will they be able to do it let's find out as we send it back on over to Atlas and
5:16:59
wolf thank you so much gentlemen and I am very sorry or we tried to ignore it
5:17:05
as much as possible uh here while we were casting because we knew our whole lot of time was going to be spent on
5:17:11
dissecting how that zigs managed to lose that game and I'm really glad that we did get to the bottom of it and that's
5:17:18
great to know I'm a big proponent of building LeAndre I was okay with getting the void staff but there wasn't a death
5:17:26
cap there wasn't a LeAndre and the I think part of we talked about Berserker
5:17:32
outdamage to zigs but as was pointed out and we didn't touch on it too much in game uh was really just the build um
5:17:38
limiting his damage the Satchel usage was a bit questionable throughout and Jew's had some good zigs games uh the
5:17:44
last year but this this was not our favorite and look early year Jitters potentially um and I don't want to take
5:17:51
anything away from DN freaks either because they had a pretty heroic uh win in this one nice comeback from them and
5:17:58
kind of Against All Odds we're able to despite a range disadvantage win uh and
5:18:03
I think a lot of that based on the plays we saw from Dudu a lot of it from Berserker you know being completely
5:18:10
Fearless in his kalista play and I'm just looking forward to more to be honest and luckily that's what we got
5:18:16
coming up exactly we've got game number two it is on the horizon and we'll see who's going to be
5:18:21
able to take it here because of course no more zigs we don't need to worry about that uh because this is fearless
5:18:27
baby and we just don't even need to worry few of the Bands might be getting looked at as well of course we did have
5:18:34
the auroras taken away the V the Scana the gante uh naus leono two of uh lens's favorite
5:18:41
Champions were banned in the second round if he does get his support logged in earlier on then maybe it's going to be a better experience for them but it
5:18:48
did feel like in that first first game the both teams got the archetypes that they were looking for right we saw it
5:18:54
the very beginning kalista and Bessa and the rata all locked in th that's a
5:18:59
phenomenal core as far as creating a short range brawling composition and then the zigs Yon sajwani like they were
5:19:06
saying lot of s Side Lane power and then that range that the zigs provides and the wave clear if that side laning is
5:19:11
something you're going to play through now we'll just have to see whether we're going to get similarly uh well-crafted
5:19:17
drafts moving into this game whether it once again just devolves into crazy
5:19:23
chaos that's the big question picks like the scarner the Cante still incredibly
5:19:28
relevant here uh Ash and varis also not seen in that last game so both available
5:19:36
until potentially banned in this first first ban phase poppy taken off the
5:19:41
board one more time so we're definitely going to see a different look than di versus poke in this second game no bread
5:19:50
Force have first pick so if they decide to say they want the ash or the varis
5:19:55
they just leave both open here in the final ban they'll ban the Jacks and they get to choose and this may mean that we
5:20:01
see Dean freaks similarly leave both open as well yeah the Jack span is kind
5:20:06
of curious means that leaving a lot available aora I think probably needs to be looked at right yeah the cassant also
5:20:12
a big one the Aurora it would be the most logical if you want to trade ad carries
5:20:18
here and uh corki once again will be taken away here from fiser fer has I
5:20:24
mean he practically was a Corky one trick all year last year oh man Cante going to be prioritized over Aurora and
5:20:32
I think it makes it an easy call to go Aurora in return here for Bulldog Bulldog has yeah he debuted the Aurora
5:20:37
in the lck right yeah and he's he's the kind of player that you're not you know when you see the aalii get locked in for
5:20:43
him you're usually thinking like okay that's a little bit out of your wheelhouse it's not that you can't do it but it's not your normal he was great at
5:20:49
Tristana was famous for it but was mostly a scaling Mage player Aurora kind of fits ail and knock turns up oh God
5:20:56
they could just lock in both of them well the nocturn is going to be the first lock in and I imagine Aurora comes
5:21:01
in after that and it's the first time we're going to see the combination utilized here in the lck cup as first
5:21:07
piosik does need h of weird stuff before he does eventually lock that one down there is his namesake um two junglers
5:21:15
and they do it the only other pick you'd want to get would be like an Oriana here but then you just give the Aurora over
5:21:20
so it just doesn't make any sense there's there's no other option here that's what we're going to see and uh
5:21:26
now things get a little bit more interesting here in terms of what we going to see fer play we could see an AP
5:21:34
jungle for Gideon and he could play ad here try to duel with this um with this Aurora or he can just lock
5:21:42
in the Victor this would be a completely weird look for Fisher cuz he's not usually the the scaling Mage
5:21:49
player type at least not here in the lck he's an a fury player yeah he likes to
5:21:55
play ad Champions most of the time well it's probably not going to be
5:22:00
nly don't mind the uh the maai but zenzo feels good and that is going to be the
5:22:07
lock in here a lot of brawling power with the Zin and the Cante means they can create a bit of a wall in front of
5:22:14
the uh the Victor as well feel a little bit better about than the Victor Jace shenanigans that we saw in our previous
5:22:20
uh series it's a really nice uh front line for a scaling mid laner later on in
5:22:26
terms of damage or it's just going to be Aurora top and you have Aurora nocturn and Oriana nocturn oh god well that's a
5:22:34
lot of combo not a lot of tanking um so the DM freaks really opting in for well
5:22:41
we don't need front line if they're all dead which you know I guess we can't
5:22:46
fault that the Ezreal band makes a lot of sense here because of you know the fact that basically what you want now as
5:22:54
n red force is a very safe Ed carrier that can do damage from very far away so that you can avoid getting collapsed on
5:23:01
by this incredibly strong set of combos that we could see here for DN freaks we'll see what else they want to ban
5:23:06
here um cuz Ezreal is the the safest pick that fits the bill and everything
5:23:12
here and I don't think you're looking for an ash in this situation uh just doesn't really make sense I mean unless
5:23:18
you're really looking to control level one but you don't know what your opponent's bottom Duo is just yet they'll ban it anyways cuz it's still
5:23:24
incredibly strong and it leaves it open for potentially game three yep and uh then the Varys is probably the answering
5:23:30
ban you could say it feels like it's sticking out like a sore thumb was banned very early on in fact in our
5:23:36
previous game it's I mean both of these bottom Duos can play anything weird and
5:23:41
crazy so you know we're thinned out in terms of 80 carries quite substantially but I like this it's perfect for the
5:23:48
comp we are diving yeah and now like with the poppy band away as well
5:23:53
absolutely genius there's nowhere to pick up something like AA to try and stop this Killer Instinct from going
5:24:00
exactly where Berserker wants it to and like Leona is up I imagine Leona for
5:24:05
life in this situation yeah imagine playing Lucian in 2025 well uh you may
5:24:12
make that dream a reality wolf I would not advise oh no I I give me back the
5:24:17
Lucian I want the Lucian back oh no well I think we might have two upsets today Atlas yeah um like we have already
5:24:26
explain we have seen Z is bad into into multiple dive
5:24:31
threats we already explained it on the space why weren't they watching they were sitting there they were sitting
5:24:36
there getting ready for the games I thought they'd be watching the global desk and look so theoretically you can
5:24:43
feather storm the you know paranoia shock wave combo so if it's just the nocturn and
5:24:50
Ariana it's genius as it turns out though there there seem to be a few other Champions though on the oh don't
5:24:56
complicate things wolf how dare you that is going to be life locking in the ra
5:25:01
and I love that uh Dean freaks didn't opt into going for I mean they they
5:25:08
could have gone for the Leona which would have been great into the raon also but they didn't opt to go for for anything super like standard in terms of
5:25:16
like just going all right well we got the Aurora we'll just get a top laner they double down they hyper index just
5:25:22
like they did in game one into their play style this is what I'm hoping to see for teams that we expect to be in
5:25:27
the rise group right going into the lck is just really leaning into your identity they're doing it already here
5:25:32
in Fearless draft on day one of the lck cup and that's exciting to see we already really know the type of team
5:25:38
that D freaks are oh yeah and we might even have one more game in this series to to really learn more but they know
5:25:43
the type of team they know that they know their identity they know what they want to do what they're good at what they've been able to accomplish early on
5:25:50
in this year in scrims and uh you just love to see teams that are like that hey that's where from he's from where you're
5:25:55
from hey that's where I'm from and I haven't been to Perth in a really long time so
5:26:00
welcome how's it going man hope you're having a great time here at low Park and
5:26:06
I hope perth's doing well as well it's been like so many years I went there for like one event called Supernova like
5:26:12
back in 2013 or something like that but that is enough story time it is time to get into this game number two nongshim
5:26:19
red force with their newly upgraded roster with kangan in the Top Lane in l h on the bottom side of the map can they
5:26:26
keep their dreams alive in the series let's find out
5:26:38
[Applause] all right here we are ladies and gentlemen onto the rift to see whether
5:26:45
the DM freaks are going to be able to pick up a victory or whether it is going to be
5:26:51
Nong shim holding on to this series bringing us to a six gamer on our very
5:26:56
first day the most League of Legends possible would be absolutely what we're
5:27:01
looking for I don't know I feel like dnf been real good today they really have
5:27:07
this draft might be like we might look back at this draft and be like Wow first
5:27:13
pick Cante really wasn't the play um I mean I'm I I looked at it when it
5:27:18
happened and was like it's not feeling like well at the time it seemed kind of less than ideal right but when the draft
5:27:25
finished you're like oo I mean they really got everything um like this draft
5:27:30
has so much power packed into it and everything works together like clockwork ah clock I get it cuz of Ariana I like
5:27:37
that yeah uh it all winds up as Berserker and life going to go a little bit aggressive here
5:27:43
against the classic Kaiser matchup and that is the Zia uh as the crash down comes out
5:27:50
immediately H taking a little bit of damage here as life utilizing that aftershot quite nicely the feather pole
5:27:55
not going to come in just yet that is of course not what you take level one life is known to put his abilities on cool
5:28:02
down uh at level one when his enemies are in range of them regardless of what he's playing I like that as well I mean
5:28:08
maximizing the value he should have flashed though and ignited he's already at full Mana you know like he didn't
5:28:15
even lose anything from that I mean where's our stat for like flashes per game and like ignites per game I think
5:28:21
that that stat really needs to be celebrated more it could maybe that that's the stat that Barrel could almost
5:28:26
always it's honestly a pretty interesting stat though when you consider that like you know a player who
5:28:32
might have very little flash usage could tell you a lot of different things about a lot of different people um yeah like
5:28:37
they need to flash cuz they're so good or like they often go like ghost ignite uh y yep yep y uh we'll uh we'll have to
5:28:47
keep asking for that one maybe next year yeah maybe it's Summoner spells per game maybe that's a that's a better
5:28:52
one uh all right dissonance not going to be really doing too much here to Fisher and both of our mid laners are staying
5:28:59
relatively low of course this used to be a very popular Lane match up it's now being kind of overshadowed by the Corky
5:29:05
aers of the world but it used to be Victa Oriana every game you know a lot
5:29:10
of CC's been added to the game since this matchup was really really um the
5:29:16
quite dull extremely common one and I feel like people still haven't realized that the Zia ult can only get you really
5:29:22
out of one you know ax gave me credit for complaining about picking Zia into kenon
5:29:29
because the ult still on the ground kind of same thing with Aurora yeah um and
5:29:34
a well the fact that you can just get the feather storm by pressing paranoia
5:29:40
is like another thing as well so I feel like you just kind of have to as Fisher might just be dead here Bulldog is going
5:29:46
to be able to get the flash at least command protect going to keep him alive as those minions got angry and he had
5:29:52
just enough Mana to do so Yos not even really needed here I think he threw out a dustbringer but that was about it yeah
5:30:00
going to be too significant cuz they're both just going to teleport back to Lane yeah but wait I was told that this is
5:30:05
why we had to change teleport cuz it just lets players just go back to Lane for free there's no way they'll still do
5:30:12
that well it turns out they did just Bulldog had ignite he'd be dead
5:30:20
at all right well um they are still going to be fighting
5:30:26
you can see the uh death raid doing some stuff here from Fisher yeah this this early game has
5:30:32
been pretty uh timid let's look at Top Lane more let's let's see some gr Ru aon's coming out this game wolf we're
5:30:39
charging up for it look at him stacking it up hey they are fighting a lot yeah King's just he's like I'm Cante come at
5:30:45
me keep hitting me I've got a a mantle uh we want gray attic man this time
5:30:54
please it's probably not happening and it's not happening it's like already confirmed not happening yeah
5:31:00
yeah I've committed to being disappointed in my brain but maybe if Cante takes like about a million damage
5:31:06
Lane harassment it could happen that's a lot of action that is a lot of damage how many times would you die taking a
5:31:12
million damage I mean I guess you could do the calculation couldn't you but we're not going to math on streams always always
5:31:17
dangerous Gideon going to push forward finds piosik piosik finds him now just going back
5:31:24
away there's not a lot of health bar here in this mid lane maybe that means that we're we're going to get get to the
5:31:30
ruinous boy the H coming up here Bulldog doesn't have teleport this could be I
5:31:36
mean with the teleport coming in here from dooo maybe we are going to fight but going to say maybe we're looking for
5:31:41
a bit of a later First Blood situation again yeah this is a heck of a rotation really making sure that they can uh grab
5:31:48
these grubs up in 15 seconds B be a to take that one away he is just hanging
5:31:53
out bottom Lane kingan's going to catch the wave doesn't have TP um that won't
5:31:59
do it no not quite reaching life just continues trotting
5:32:05
by and uh with I mean it's a big investment as Kos going to be able to
5:32:10
take the first grub so no Feats of Strength going to be taken down here and he can just flash out of the way if he'd
5:32:16
like to instead he decides to just go in and that seems like a good idea because Fisher is in a whole host of trouble
5:32:22
Bulldog going to be able to throw down the command distance and picks up the kill with a commander attack they take down the knockturn in the end as Gideon
5:32:28
has to flash to get himself out of the way and jiu's made his way in three versus three now but the ulti comes
5:32:35
through from Dudu gets the flash out from jiu there as well well and man it is chaos but it's working out uh for dnf
5:32:42
yeah in terms of flashes feels like a trade up here for dnf they're also able to get a kill on Oriana versus a kill
5:32:49
onto the uh shinha now they do end up getting a feet of strength even though they weren't able to get three grubs
5:32:55
because they got first Blood yes First Blood did come in yeah so that that's you know a big win here for dnf uh we're
5:33:02
hoping to get that plus the three unable to do so this fight is really Scrappy like dudo is not even here initially cuz
5:33:08
he's trying to clear this wave to get an extra Advantage there he gets six he comes down here and fer basically dies
5:33:15
instantly but Gideon gets a ton of work done to a nocturn that just isn't really able to fight that well early and spend
5:33:21
a lot of his resources helping to kill um that Victor so bit of a weird fight
5:33:26
there but ultimately still a big win for dnf because they got the more more grubs more flashes and also that first Fus
5:33:33
strength with the first blood and a kill onto Oriana I would say more valuable than onto the shinel yeah definitely and
5:33:39
a possible five grubs available if they're able to get that feed of strength by the next round of grubs it does come in Cloud Drake up and
5:33:46
available here for either team they are going to be able to get enough people down here to look for it looks like it
5:33:52
is not really a big Focus right now so we've just got bottom Lanes meeting up once again Berserker holding on to this
5:33:58
wave and we are just probably going to go back into a bit of a a l State once again for now
5:34:05
yeah we've been kind of lacking on the little States far a lot of aggression
5:34:11
yeah I'm kind of like I was a little bit scared I'm like well but that's our whole lck thing like how can how could people be like oh the LC casters are so
5:34:17
fun if we just don't get to have fun um yeah we're too busy like talking about the game yeah like the game and like all
5:34:23
the exciting action I'm like wait when will we get to talk about jrpgs and stuff and it was it was crazy as well
5:34:29
cuz I was really worried that we weren't necessarily going to get so much action cuz I was watching the LPL and it was like not exactly the most high octane
5:34:36
League of Legends that I had seen over the last couple of days as there's the shock wave combination but the
5:34:42
gravity field is in good position now chaos storm trade going to come on through there and Fisher doesn't even
5:34:47
need to use his flash so yes piosik and Bulldog managed to nail the combo and no
5:34:53
it didn't really do anything yeah I mean it gives Bulldog a little bit of a Health Advantage in Lane but that
5:34:59
probably won't necessarily translate anything and pik's ult is now down um whereas Gideon has his so perhaps
5:35:04
there's a world where no shim are able to use this timing to try to pressure on the dragon while Berserker is pushed in
5:35:10
looks like that's exactly what's going to happen so while it may have been an opportunity for Bulldog to try to push
5:35:15
further advantages it's ultimately going to be the first objective full objective that is to say going over to Noam still
5:35:22
have one3 of the spe spring off of this attempted play in the mid lane but otherwise it's still very quiet game
5:35:28
with not a lot of action it was like very uh short amount of action but no death and then it was just back to Tak
5:35:35
effect chilling yep lot of vision uh there for Nong shim as well DF not
5:35:40
really too many opportunities to try and counteract that so credit going to Nong shim there they had a plan they executed
5:35:47
and they get the reward so nicely done grabing grabbing themselves third of a fet of strength and getting themselves a
5:35:52
little bit closer to a uh hopefully infernal Soul um because then we' get
5:35:58
some Earth Wind and Fire which I think is a nice way um you know to continue this series
5:36:03
sure I mean everybody loves that yeah how do you feel about the new teleport
5:36:09
do you like the sort of like gliding on in there um there's some things I like about it I think it looks very fun uh
5:36:15
it's it's hard to get used to the timing like sometimes I I'm like oh I I need to go in now I need to wait a little bit
5:36:20
longer to get my like full health before I TP and then I'm just like sitting there cuz it takes so long I'm like oh I should have tpd a second earlier I like
5:36:27
that you can teleport to Wards again and and minions um pre1 that's very fun uh I
5:36:34
like the indicator on the ground you know I like that a lot so I'm I'm getting used to I think the parts I don't like about it are really just
5:36:40
growing pains for me as I adjust to it I think that makes sense how do you feel about calling at Turtle Port before it
5:36:46
gets upgraded that's cool I like that that's a cool idea all right I'm behind it we'll see whether we'll see whether
5:36:52
that drives with everybody else but I kind of like turtle Port uh before it gets Unleashed and then it can just be teleport from that point on sure as Nong
5:36:59
shim they've started off these grubs life getting some uh information there because they did just kill the control W
5:37:05
that he had put down they can be be there at a moment's notice the paranoia back off cool down once again I think
5:37:11
that piosik is looking for an opportunity here but it is Nim being able to lock down at least one of them
5:37:16
life goes in there's the paranoia they do get the flash out from Fisher gravity field not really doing too much as
5:37:22
bulldog has to flash himself out of the way the ulti from Gideon gets him in there and Bulldog nowhere to run and will be taken down goic the same fate
5:37:29
and this is one of the issues with this draft if the Wombo doesn't work you got nothing left yeah and you need you need
5:37:37
have your Aurora in position to really help Zone and and then you can actually win both sides of the fight while one of the carries gets pushed out but this is
5:37:44
going to be a plate going over the Fisher on top of three grubs going over and uh the dragon was already picked up
5:37:50
so this is looking great for n shim dudo oh dear you do not want to be in melee range with this guy who's going to go
5:37:57
all out thankfully he gets to just dip Between Worlds and he's going to be fine the ulti comes through from Doo but he misses the
5:38:02
Q got to charge things up and it looks like ulti for ulti is just going to be the trade no flashes no nothing and it's
5:38:09
just fine it's all right little bit of action but watch this Flash from fer
5:38:15
like he's isolated on the side of the fight so he looks like an ideal Target here but he's able to flash the fat wall
5:38:21
here and then the re-engage from lens is beautiful and both of you know bulldog
5:38:26
and life here just completely shut down out of the fight and then if the setup is better for Dudu maybe you actually
5:38:34
can win that but just nowhere to be seen and just go for for one big combo onto a player who simply flashes out of Dodge
5:38:40
and end up losing out as a result so two kills now to n shim two fets of strength
5:38:46
or 2/3 of the feet of strength I should say um the grub pickup and you know
5:38:51
we're still at a fairly even game State here but we're going to have to see dnf set up a little bit better than that and
5:38:58
if that's how they're going to fight really wants that Ward it's supportal combat yeah and he's able to take that
5:39:03
one down life going to be walking over a w of his own as we saw there but doesn't
5:39:08
actually sweep that one out I don't think no never mind he will and so like you say supportal combat indeed as spos
5:39:15
just does none of it where's do yeah like what and what's the outcome of this
5:39:20
like what are we what are we doing here is now King and no ulti but still going to be going aggressive here that was
5:39:25
weird didn't know that's how the interaction worked as Nim going to try and steal away a bramble B you can see
5:39:31
Bulldog going to get pulled over life is here as well Berserker he can kill her Instinct in lens finds the angle there
5:39:37
as life gets the magnet storm over the wall with the eathan rain and Berserker is able to lock down the kill onto the
5:39:42
Victor you can see now wants to find the opportunity he gets in there the feather storm comes down though does he have the
5:39:48
feather pull the answer is no has Berserker looking to try and dash his way out with that supercharge but the audacious charge is going to be better
5:39:54
and it's a double kill for Gideon he's now even further ahead in this game as Nong shim not going quietly into tonight
5:40:02
no certainly not and uh that's four kills to the xinia in this game he has
5:40:08
all four um they're under his name and on top of a very squishy kaisa is able
5:40:14
to get it done there was a really nice cool beginning to that fight it looked like dnf had the turn of the century
5:40:21
with how it looked like oh things are look a little bit rough for piosik the Oriana setup isn't great here look at
5:40:26
Bulldog you know he's already lost a third of his health and then it's a both a disengage here for piosik as well as
5:40:32
kind of a re-engage when he goes back in here he flashes over the wall Victor is
5:40:37
down and you're like okay this is pretty good but then things get a little bit messy cuz Berserker decides to opt in to
5:40:43
go over the wall J has his ultimate and when it's just kaisa versus Zia in that
5:40:48
type of interaction yeah I guess it is the counter you know in that specific case I think they could have just been
5:40:53
happy with the kill they got and walked away their Berserker saw blood in the water that's just the type of player he
5:40:58
is um but if in this case if he had a little bit more restraint it probably would have turned out better for them yeah I could imagine that this is uh so
5:41:05
far not necessarily been the Wombo Combo dream that uh the DM freaks have been
5:41:11
looking for is going to be an ocean soul this game as we have that feed of strength now completed so it is just
5:41:17
first turret for either team whoever gets it can buy some cool shoes which is
5:41:23
pretty dope his life is going to find the shattering strike towards leens magnet storm does nothing and he XG
5:41:30
players man there there's some beef between them there is certainly some beef they're going for like best XG
5:41:35
player award or something like like that and now rer liked me
5:41:45
better he came back to the LC for me well he's not playing with you well he's not playing with you either is yeah
5:41:50
exactly pretty sure he came back for Delight PR could you imagine like the the dnf or
5:41:57
nongshim like battle against gen that is going to be the biggest one that's where all of the beef really lies this is just
5:42:03
the initial taste test yeah I don't know there has been a lot of interaction between these two yeah uh this game as
5:42:10
Herold is up as well and lens yeah looking for Bulldog here gets Charmed up
5:42:16
and the chaos storm doing a fair bit of work but uh Bulldogs going to be able to walk away from it looks like Nim they'll
5:42:22
be able to collect themselves another one that is a fourth as far as these objectives are concerned it's not Earth
5:42:28
Wind and Fire so that's a little bit of a shame and the rift arel does go down that will be secured here by Gideon he
5:42:33
can put that down wherever he likes suned Sky almost has Cleaver completed as well as okay paranoia comes in
5:42:39
they're going to get the combo but can they get the kill that's the question the answer yes they absolutely can well
5:42:45
it turns out they can only kill Fisher this game but they've done it three times so it's starting to stack up you
5:42:50
yeah it's working I mean uh you know if you have a plan and you stick to it then often times things can go quite well it
5:42:57
was a really nice idea there though obviously D shim were trying to bail out after getting that Herald dropped um and
5:43:03
then you have the punish to come through here lens had a really success uccessful setup in the last exchange but then
5:43:10
there's that combo once again fer has been the primary target he's feared he is just dead nothing he can do even
5:43:17
Flash in there wouldn't have saved him now The Herald May guarantee that second feet of strength here yeah exactly can
5:43:24
use that to push towards any of these outter turrets and try and take them down that mid lane outer is looking juicy primed and ready here for Shell to
5:43:31
come down so far they haven't utilized it though you can see Gideon can park her here in this mid lane if you would
5:43:37
like to but instead he'd be holding on to it for the minute you mentioned in our last series like okay uh you know
5:43:43
the gold is where it needs to be this no weird situation where the jungler has four kills well this time we have that
5:43:49
situation it's not ideal for Nim I think this game is a lot closer than it initially appeared because of it is it
5:43:56
the worst though because I feel like a Fed zins out isn't the most terrible thing in the world I it's not Sani you
5:44:02
know yeah yeah yeah I think you'd prefer something like a vgo to get super fair cuz like it's feels like a legitimate
5:44:08
carry threat but zenzo I think can still really get some carrying done yeah like
5:44:13
you know he can utilize that gold to just drop a Herald into a turret and that gives you a feet of strength so
5:44:18
there you go gets another charge there as well Zer gets 25 gold but I'd probably take the charge I think
5:44:24
so um well that's that's huge that felt like a very uh passive I'm just going to
5:44:31
drop this and they're just going to take it situation and that that's certainly what happened he got the additional
5:44:37
charge as well so feeling really good about that is okay oh I've seen this movie before this time it's going to be
5:44:43
a slightly different version this one is a little bit colder and Aurora is going to be able to grab that kill so yep um I
5:44:50
think the dnf have given up on winning the game they're just going to kill fer as many times as
5:44:56
possible going to come on through yeah I think that lens thinks he's found an option here Berserker is in the vicinity
5:45:03
but I think kingan understands he's probably not going to be able to win this one out with uh Gideon still moving out of
5:45:09
Base okay well minus one gante teleport but little turret action in the bottom
5:45:16
Lane for Bulldog he's going to have his teleport back online pretty soon so as long as nothing bad happens here
5:45:23
feeling pretty good about how they were able to answer this teleport Fisher is going to actually come over here and
5:45:29
clear this real quick cuz he's Victor but that that wasn't the most ideal usage of teleport true I have some be
5:45:35
wolf yeah I think well let's go Grill it and make some amazing I think the new Victor mini map
5:45:42
icon looks too similar to Vol Bears what the the weird face thing yeah um doesn't
5:45:48
it look a bit like volibear if you like squint your eyes well you know I was waiting to to to use this for like a a
5:45:56
low State and I guess we're kind of in one yeah when did Victor become protos like like come on I thought he was just
5:46:02
like this mad scien is protos or is it ELO like is it like is it St or is it Warhammer no it's he's protos man he's
5:46:09
zol's cousin we who is Z's cousin apparently Victor
5:46:16
man I don't know oh okay it's just Victor okay mind like seriously all I can see is a
5:46:22
protos when I see him every time okay so what we need we just need the voice actor to do like my life for a and then
5:46:29
like it' be so good right I think it's the cross we all been missing need yeah yeah yeah we really need to like dig
5:46:34
into the meme it has to happen have you watched AE yet I haven't
5:46:39
actually that's why I don't really know a lot about why it's like this yet I've been waiting I've been prepping I've had
5:46:45
a lot of stuff going on there's a lot I was traveling I haven't seen it yet but I need to see it I haven't seen it yet I
5:46:51
watched I need to watch it again cuz uh it got a bit like there's a lot um as as
5:46:56
that show went on so it's not the easy watching you know you're not like watching scrubs or something as lens is
5:47:01
going to be able to watch out for the shattering strike and does make his Escape yeah arcan was defin not my like
5:47:07
the first season was definitely not my late um Night Watch like it was definitely like early in the morning and
5:47:14
I'm really hyped it like hyperfocused he said that I should have watched it cuz it should have been my prep for uh the
5:47:19
season that's true yeah she's she's a bit a bit uh a bit upset I'm in trouble um why you watch I watched it don't
5:47:26
worry I watched it don't worry um enjoyed it I actually thought it was fantastic spoilers
5:47:32
gon thankfully we can only read that wolf just don't read it out okay there just there's Arcane season 2 spoilers in
5:47:39
our prompto right now ladies and gentlemen that's what uh and we're doing our best right we're we're avoiding it
5:47:45
because much like wolf there are some people that haven't seen it yet all right hold up okay atakan has been
5:47:51
started Vision being delivered and lens is on a flank angle but it's so far away
5:47:56
for Bulldog oh Berserker is going to get caught out they all just dive on top of him there's the ulti and the Flash out
5:48:03
though and the chaos storm comes down and the thre man shock wave is gone once again fer is dead and this time
5:48:09
Dudu is on the perfect flank angle oh out of that guy he really does kill some
5:48:16
teams and it's going to happen once again as dnf they'll be able to take him down I thought initially it was
5:48:21
Bulldog's teleport on the flank there but it was actually dudo and he's able to after the fosic Bulldog combo there
5:48:28
the nocturn Oriana setup he's able to lock them down while they can't Retreat it actually ended up being very
5:48:33
beautiful here from dnf you have to trust that you're going to hit the combo in the situation you can see that teleport I'm talking about down to the bottom um here as Oriana shows up
5:48:41
towards the top side and Berserker flashes the wall here and then Lights Go Out life sets it up with the magnet
5:48:48
storm too and then dud here like oh you guys thought you were getting away you thought you were going to cut your
5:48:53
losses no it's even worse and they will walk away with a vicious Aon here and a
5:49:00
ton of advantages now across the board they should be able to also deny the soul uh here utilizing thisan at the
5:49:08
same time and so dnf they will move towards a gold Advantage for the first time it feels like in a long time in
5:49:15
this game as Berserker can just feel free to go aggressive is going to continue to do so lens has the battle
5:49:20
dance so he's going to be able to get himself out of the way as the rest of nim are all grouped up wanting to try and send dnf back home although it does
5:49:27
feel like a free ticket with this vicious arakan or just Aron in general I think one of the big problems I have for
5:49:33
the game State here for Noam is just simply like we talked about how all the money's on jincha but also the main big
5:49:41
damage dealer the safe damage dealer in the Victor is just so far behind yeah it's not feeling too safe as they catch
5:49:46
him once again down he goes and remember they get a free ticket home that's
5:49:52
precisely what they want life's going to die back in get the Magnus oh my God the damage is revolting Dudu is under about
5:49:59
seven turrets and he's just going to take the easy way out they take two with them they do no damage to the turret but
5:50:05
they have a great time yeah 06 and I I swear it's not even fish's fault yeah no it's a shutdown
5:50:12
onto Gideon as well I'm not sure who got the kill um but that's that's also big money that they pick up on this play and
5:50:19
it's just time after time after time they kill fer they focus him down who
5:50:26
gets that shut down looks like it's actually Oriana yeah so that's even worse and the life is just happy to to
5:50:32
toss his magnet storm out to uh to set up the return home and hey I mean they did all die right or
5:50:40
like pseudo die so that is like five pedals yeah kind of good you only give
5:50:46
away 40 like you get 40 gold per kill that's more than a cannon pedals worth of adaptive damage and a little bit of
5:50:52
experience points there you go I guess it's worth it Atlas uh I'm looking at the money at the top of the screen though and I'm thinking nah probably not
5:50:59
and uh we're going to see it again oh God this time it's the zire that's taken out J didn't really know what was going
5:51:06
on the were off and then his lights were out uh it's possibly Baron time I think
5:51:11
it's pretty reasonable to to do Baron here yeah I I going to give you that one uh-huh um yeah let's see the damage
5:51:18
taken I'm surprised fer is lower though he doesn't have enough Health to
5:51:24
take that much damage it's just like current Starcraft 2 balance Pros is underpowered it all goes back to that
5:51:31
all right Pik taking so much damage from this Baron as we can see dude are going to have to help out without I think isz
5:51:37
now kingan could be in trouble he eats a whole bunch of the CC but Fisher he eats a slowy wall and he doesn't really want
5:51:43
to the cast on doing a lot of work here but the magnet storm is going to do the same thing maybe an overstep though as he's taken out desker getting into that
5:51:50
back line Gideon might be going down again and yes he does there's no damage to take him out and it's two going into
5:51:57
the hands of the Kaiser and now kingan is surrounded by dnf Boys jiu trying to
5:52:03
make his way back and he does manage to get a few of these the feather storm comes through but oh the feather pull is
5:52:09
gorgeous oh then Bulldog also flashes but doesn't get the kill yosik has the ultimate and jiu doesn't have his and
5:52:16
he's dead oh but the feathers the feather's taking out okay so pushing solo the baron and it's worth it my guy
5:52:23
wait how did he mess that up how did he walk into those Bulldog man you flash and miss and don't get he really wanted
5:52:30
to put a command protect on pososi you know just in case the 10 Health Z is
5:52:35
going to kill him that's not okay okay Berserker is the first to die at this time around okay hold on I want
5:52:41
to watch this again I don't care about anything except like the ending like yeah this is cool it's like Aurora zoning yeah Fisher dies again yeah I've
5:52:48
already seen this movie he does a lot of damage by the way with the re-engage here from the hens that's what kind of saves this but I just want to see
5:52:55
bulldog in these final moments we're do there's like a dragon so I don't know if we will but anyway I'll have to go watch
5:53:01
it on YouTube later cuz he flashes and then doesn't get the okay we have to
5:53:06
come out of it a little bit of a shame as Fisher uh do we need to see I mean he's probably dead again uh okay gravity
5:53:13
field goes down that's is dead yeah dragon is definitely dead and it's going to be dnf that deny the
5:53:19
soul and so once again we are going to remain without an ocean soul theift gutl
5:53:24
is going to be taken so be takeen this we saw damage taken for Fisher I'd love
5:53:30
to see how much damage he's done this game he's on two items now he has the uh
5:53:36
upgrade ated boots um I don't know if he could really afford the tier three boots let's just say the current game state in
5:53:43
his economy at the moment but I think he really needs to to somehow stabilize in
5:53:48
this game if there's going to be a chance it's 4,000 gold lead slen is a No Man's Land he's in a bit of trouble here
5:53:54
does have a lot of Mobility as he is recan so able to get himself out but now at 50% going in going to be a bit of a
5:54:00
tough one as Berserker just happily clearing out waves K going to be a to catch that one
5:54:06
so we're still looking for a baron as dudo the fact that he's so safe clearing
5:54:12
these waves in mid really is a little bit of a bother here yeah it's very annoying it's very frustrating and every
5:54:19
time he hits it and Brocks at leandre's just taken away at the health bars a little bit yep he's also stacked a lot
5:54:25
of grasp yes he's very tanky seen still building full damage of course this way
5:54:30
you get demolish and fun things like that and you also just get a whole bunch of health so as you can see pretty
5:54:37
healthy it's fun when you have a ranged champion in Top Lane to just harass people and Bully them yeah everybody
5:54:42
loves that it's good to see that Dudu is like still continuing to follow in the Keen footsteps as of course you know the
5:54:48
DN freaks used to be the Africa freaks where you know Keen got all of his Fame
5:54:54
and Dudu really taking over that one and the both of them play a pretty mean Aurora I mean Nim are really standing
5:55:00
their ground here they're clearing this wave and they actually have a fast track to the baron I mean dnf this is not just
5:55:05
a free win you still have to fight you still have to set up those combos Dudu got zoned out by kingan and now there an
5:55:10
opportunity here I mean the combo set up for piosik and Bulldog but they have no vision there's a scary flank Ward here
5:55:15
as you can see the baron down to 50% it's going down so incredibly fast yeah the teleport is a little late you could
5:55:22
say as now pic yeah no opportunity still hasn't even pressed the ultimate button
5:55:27
and that is just highway robbery dnf I think really bot this and Dudu was
5:55:33
really well zoned out by King and Gideon there and once he moved away they were like all right cool we have Baron
5:55:38
there's no setup Vision here we can clear that out and then just rush it down is level 14 in this game and it
5:55:45
just matter it doesn't seem to matter would you say that they did not factor
5:55:51
in the baron play sure yeah yeah there's the first one uh of yeah I was I was I
5:55:57
was like do we do it on day one like come on it's like they have the whole the gr and everything yeah yeah no we probably shouldn't have's back like you
5:56:03
know let's be nice and all and I think just with the way that this game is gone and and the way Fisher has made me feel
5:56:08
I feel I felt like it was an appropriate time fer is like me in every Sol like uh I'm a bit of a passenger but
5:56:16
um I will absorb the cooldowns yeah yeah yeah it's like no don't worry guys he used his flash um yeah like every time I
5:56:23
die I like Ping the noct Oriana ult everyone's like yay we saw you die
5:56:29
it's fine uh this game is weird because I I think that while I still think dnf
5:56:35
are in a in a very favorable position no are you know sitting on on Baron here so that's going to lead to a lot of gold
5:56:42
which should level out the gold substantially it's still fairly close it's 2.5k between the two of them and
5:56:47
they're just one Dragon away from getting ocean soul which is pretty good for gante it's not the greatest into a
5:56:52
big Wombo Combo cuz you're not going to get time to heal but that's something and also like kingan picked up the
5:56:58
Mercurial snow pierces as well as you can see there towards the top side it looks a lot like a train yeah the shoes
5:57:04
and um you has a ga like his Z kind of been working out I mean it's four items
5:57:11
versus four items but it does feel like J is going to be able to sort of Stand and Deliver um utilizing that gbly it
5:57:18
feels like he shouldn't have been able to get to this point but he was gifted a few kills he's been able to farm reliably the fact that he has a lead at
5:57:24
this point after what Berserker was able to get done and how many proactive plays he had early I mean sitting on six kills
5:57:29
it uh it feels like it's just a miracle what no has been able to accomplish in this game TP at the ready they're
5:57:36
getting the pryo first here on this Dragon fer bought an arm guard right before this bit of a desync here on the
5:57:42
back timer but he will be able to get here just in time before the dragon does spawn I think both of these teams are playing a little bit nervous yeah like
5:57:48
when you see a TP like that and the rest of team is back and you're like all right everybody calm down I imagine fer is definitely feeling
5:57:55
pretty nervous at this stage level 15 really does want to hit that level 16 Mark uh we'll see whether he can
5:58:00
actually get some of that but right now just trying to stay in fog of War as much as possible I'm I'm just saying col
5:58:06
me and cix are watching this game real closely yeah yeah yeah you were talking about him being looking similar to zeror
5:58:11
he kind of wishes he could go stealth dude really does as right now he's right
5:58:16
in the middle of his team possibly creating a paranoia Target they can't group up too much it is very dangerous J
5:58:23
taking a lot here from on a really fantastic flank as well to set up a Big Al yeah this is such an important moment
5:58:29
here for dnf can they make the combo actually work as there's the paranoia biosic not going to be able to take the
5:58:35
dragon now leens trying to keep them all alive the feather storm has already gone down and Dudu just wreaking havoc in
5:58:41
that backline berser trying to do the same thing head down to the G goes jiu but this fight is so broken up it's now
5:58:48
Berserker against the world can he get it done Gideon says no you cannot as he flashes on top of him not going to be
5:58:55
able to do it that's a double kill and fiser is on the board and we might be going a game six I cannot believe no are
5:59:01
going to win this game I just can't believe it and it was a fantastic arm
5:59:06
guard there for Fisher bought some time GI did the heavy lifting he at the ga they had everything they needed for this
5:59:12
one fight for ocean soul that's where this where the real Tipping Point comes through I suppose that last big fight
5:59:19
earlier on too was a huge win for them to grab Baron and I guess they do it Atlas I didn't see it coming well life
5:59:26
is going to try and stop them and it's it's not quite going to work out here uh
5:59:31
Dudu not going to be able to do enough either and with the ocean soul helping they going to be able to take down the
5:59:37
Nexus Nong shim will even out the series we're going to go to all six and the
5:59:42
decider is going to be coming up and we are losing like 30 Champions it's going
5:59:48
to be messy here in this last one Le hens just he jumped out of his chair and
5:59:53
he wasn't even going to look at his teammates there was not a single high five that was not a single hype moment
5:59:59
and everyone just followed Len with heads down because they know there's going to be a lot of discussion in the coaching Booth but they were able to
6:00:05
stay they were able to get it done in the end the hens had some really fantastic re-engages and I do think
6:00:11
there was a lot of hubris let's say on the side of dnf really really aggressive
6:00:16
plays and some halfhazard engages that led to Big disasters and uh as the meme
6:00:22
goes they did not finish game two they did not finish game two thank you wolf thank you for joining me as far as the
6:00:29
uh the acronyms are concerned it's a fun one um this wasn't a fun game however it's a best of three it's totally fine
6:00:36
they can come back they can make something happen in the next one Dudu feeling a little bit robbed after that 36k damage um really kind of making
6:00:45
things happen but that is not what gets you uh gets you games it is killing nexi yeah I mean look at the very little
6:00:51
damage that all of the Nan players did but they did it at the end where it mattered on the critical objectives they had a dragon lead they're able to take
6:00:57
that Baron and that was enough yep crazy game we hit like a 6K gold lead for dnf
6:01:04
and uh unfortunately it was downhill from there these games are wild today
6:01:09
wolf it has been real wacky but it's now time for us to take a short break when we get back the decider between dnf and
6:01:16
Nong shim we'll see whether once again it's a reverse sweep or whether dnf can find the form in this last game we'll
6:01:22
see you soon [Music]

6:08:03
you it's the opening day of the 2025 lck
6:08:09
season so of course it's going to be a six gamer as it's all tied on up here in
6:08:14
this series Nong shim red Force find a way to fight back against the D and
6:08:20
freaks welcome back to the space for the final time today in a pre-show format
6:08:25
Deon alongside chronicler and ox and uh yeah we've had a silly series these
6:08:32
teams fight back and forth and it feels like whoever grabs the early lead doesn't really matter this really does
6:08:38
feel a lot more like solo qu games whether it's a good thing or a bad thing uh I I I'm I wouldn't be able to tell
6:08:44
you that depends on your perspective I guess but it is definitely interesting to see because in both games the team
6:08:50
that got out ofon and then got like at least three turrets off of it didn't win
6:08:56
which is which is impressive that's not a thing that that I was expecting to
6:09:01
happen and really for these two teams just dro the best possible team fight comp that you can get yeah it kind of
6:09:07
feels like atakan has like a hidden buff of giving confidence and the teams just become over confident and Flo but this
6:09:15
is when honestly Nong shim should be done this game should be over the shock wave hits three they try to commit onto
6:09:20
baz don't find him they get completely cooked with this flank coming through from Dudu on the Aurora and they throw
6:09:27
outat I'm like well guess it's a 2 but I was slowly
6:09:33
mistaken that's that's one thing like getting Aon in of itself is f but then they also do the thing where they then
6:09:39
go and push a bunch of turrets and I get wanting to get value out of your false
6:09:45
life but it feel like this time it didn't really set up for anything so it
6:09:50
was just kind of a a relatively even trade they kind stalled out they Dove mid they didn't get that many kills and
6:09:56
then the the reset time and they got like two kills everyone died and then there was enough time before Dragon
6:10:01
spawned that it like wasn't that much of a big deal I will say that uh this is
6:10:06
the first game that this whole team is playing in the arena and the audience knows when you get Aon you get uh the
6:10:13
revive buff you run it down down mid and try to get objectives everyone was screaming at every play they made with
6:10:19
the oton and let's see what happened here at 25 minutes there's the fight clear near Baron and we had uh an
6:10:26
interesting look at comms here yeah I mean this one was super chaotic um and
6:10:33
actually we see Fisher kind out pretty well here he did not have a great game it was a rough one for him but he did a
6:10:38
lot to buy time and jiu is actually respawning cuz he got taken out earlier than this H without his old you can see
6:10:45
that without that ad carry damage they're starting to struggle and it gets very Scrappy I got to say Berserker and
6:10:51
Bulldog are really giving it their all oh sorry Berserker and Dudu uh Bulldog unfortunately uh as as we're about to
6:10:58
see here tries to go for the flash tries to get the kill and then pay some very close attention cuz those feeds on the
6:11:03
ground he's trying to get the nocturn and he gets a free bonus yeah and honestly that
6:11:11
made a big difference you can see bazer in the chat figing him like what just happened like that caught them off guard
6:11:16
and as a result of that play it did make a sizable difference cuz you know the all of n were able to respawn get set up
6:11:23
in time yeah and from that play then we got the reset earlier the reset from
6:11:29
bulldog and you're thinking okay let's settle down Buffs over they had a close fight that's when the baron gets snuck
6:11:35
away Way by Nim red Force they then have Tempo that leads down to this Drake fight that ultimately ends the game yeah
6:11:41
and there's a decent amount of poke that has come down to do before this but securing the ocean soul you can actually see it makes a decent difference in this
6:11:48
fight the healing coming through they do a great job of peeling uh for when the ga comes out the chaos storm the Arcane
6:11:54
storm sorry is massive and then that final attempt to flash it again the the healing the little bit of extra HP
6:12:00
really the deciding factor so the Smite clutch in this one yeah you actually see it on lens there I think the most
6:12:07
actually ended up getting like two 300 health throughout the whole sequence able to get a couple of extra rotations
6:12:12
out and between these two teams our first series had games that felt very one-sided right like they were very it
6:12:19
was very obvious pretty early on which was going to win I still have not learned anything I think that both these two teams are still very clearly kind of
6:12:25
figuring out what works for them I think in the team finding Nim have generally looked okay but then when it comes on
6:12:31
their movement around the map for some of the setup they look really rough and then dnf feel like they should be
6:12:37
winning more than they have been yeah it's also what's so weird to me is both these teams have picked up some pretty
6:12:43
big players you know we have like piosik world champion we have lens as well who's one lck and is a great shot caller
6:12:49
but it feels so chaotic and Scrappy like despite the fact that we have these kind of star players who've gone places
6:12:55
before it still feels Scrappy and I honestly feel like game too this draft of DN dnf they had so much die potential
6:13:01
and yes Z can avoid die but we've seen it doesn't always work before there's multiple sources D was using his off
6:13:06
cool down the Victor got brutally punished they had Aurora and and still
6:13:12
like I feel like the draft and like a nocturn Oriana Aurora is a disgusting combination we even saw that like Aurora
6:13:19
nocturn combo used by geni last year I think the draft was pretty fine for them
6:13:24
and now they can't lean on those picks again so you know as much as it was a close game I feel like the loss with
6:13:30
such an advantage that they had and the fact they've lost momentum I feel like it is going to hurt a bit Yeah speaking spefic spefically about Victor uh fer
6:13:37
said this Victor is made out of my Tears because of how often he was dying that was translated for us earlier uh again
6:13:43
was picked on a lot here uh who else do you want to see in this next draft because when we looked at the previous
6:13:49
draft for the freaks it felt like you got the Aurora you got the knock turn you knew what was coming it's it's got to be team fighting right and the
6:13:55
scarner is going to remain banned like I don't think we're going to see that champion and we shouldn't because he's one of the few like top tier junglers
6:14:01
that is still available uh and we might get to the point cuz we're getting to game three Series where if you're able
6:14:06
to snag up a specific role early on and you can then with bands try to really choke it up for the opposing team that's
6:14:12
something that game three in a best of three is usually pretty early generally you won't see that until game four or
6:14:17
five but particularly this early in the split I think throwing teams off can be a Big Boon I think for me bar the zigs
6:14:24
in game one both of these 0 carries have looked pretty good when theyve been on picks that they're comfortable with so I think the team that enables them that
6:14:30
gives them agency will perform I think both of them are capable of carrying games if you give them the right tools
6:14:36
and remember they are playing for their group uh in the lck cup not just
6:14:42
themselves but for the group all these matches matter and yes we're still waiting for the teams that went to Worlds we're still waiting for the big
6:14:49
guns here in the lck but those those teams are still trying to cheer for everyone you can see chronically this is
6:14:55
how all the fans are feeling right now for both those sides cuz they don't want to fall down earlier and that's a lot of extra pressure right you're not just oh
6:15:01
there we go we're just you're not just losing your own series you're also losing for your team you
6:15:07
can't be letting down the gen's and the hanas it's not just that as well but if if your group loses geni H they'll
6:15:14
probably be fine cuz they'll be at the top of the group if you're at the bottom of the group you might not get a chance to fight again you know so it's
6:15:20
definitely a concerning Factor yeah well Nim has the opportunity to make it two Z for their group will they be able to do
6:15:26
it or will the DN freaks tie things up let's find out as we go to the final match of the day as we send it on over
6:15:32
to Wolf and Atlas thank you so much gentlemen yes there is a lot on the line not only is it just a
6:15:40
victory for either of these teams but it is also Baron versus Elder is it going to be a clean sweep for the Barons or
6:15:46
are we going to see the elders make their way back I think Baron won the first series did they not I think they did uh it's hard to keep track uh with
6:15:53
who's on which team but right now hoping for a tie up that makes things more fun uh no it's uh DRX is Elder so they want
6:16:02
all right never mind so it is Elder that's already up 1 Zer and the DN freaks wanted to even out even it out
6:16:08
with a uh Baron if you're wondering what it means if your group wins it means that you get no one gets eliminated in
6:16:15
your group and you have a higher chance of of skipping plays basically so yeah uh and going straight to the playoff
6:16:21
braacket if your group loses the bottom team of that group will just immediately be eliminated and then you have to play
6:16:27
through the playin and uh you get straight into the playoffs with the top three teams in the winning group it's
6:16:32
actually like kind of a big deal it's pretty huge this is also pretty huge uh
6:16:37
which is the draft between these two teams we saw the uh the space go over it there are now a lot of Champions 20
6:16:44
Champions that have been removed we're going to remove another six before we get into picking them and uh let's just
6:16:50
see what's left up and available looks like DN freaks are like well we're just going to like there's no
6:16:56
supports left with band Leona what are you going to do yeah um is it just going to be Leona and uh Nautilus perhaps
6:17:04
Leona Nautilus and they just uh say well yeah there we are so Leona not let's see what the hens plays it's it's really
6:17:11
interesting to of all the players in the LC to be like you know what I bet L hens can't play a lot I was going to say like
6:17:18
I just really hope that we get the Elise lock in I'm going to need to see it the vi is going to be taken away here Gideon
6:17:23
could of course like play the Elise you know she's got a cool new skin and stuff it's like really fun um but also lens
6:17:30
has been an elite support player since the dawn of time Rumble still going to be banned away here permanently banned
6:17:35
throughout the series so far Cori also has been hitting the deck quite a lot that might be the final ban here for
6:17:41
Nong shim unless they want to get rid of things like the poppy that can be quite annoying I mean Varys and Ash are still
6:17:47
up right so those are big picks I think that we could see Rise up to that first spot losing his Kindred interesting so
6:17:55
we might just trade Ash varis so 80 carries unlock the question is what are
6:18:00
you going to play with uh said 8 carries cuz there's a lot of fun stuff left available like you could play enchanter
6:18:06
supports you can play like Bard is is still here Braum is still here for early level one Shenanigans and you do have um
6:18:13
the blitzcrank the pike uh these types of things um no re for a misfortune so
6:18:20
not as common now corki has been banned every time and Fisher's like thank God and she I'm playing it sorry man I think
6:18:26
you're going to just go 0 60 oh no what is what can Fisher play to stop himself
6:18:32
from you know dying all the time maybe oh yeah maybe Triston should have been Kindred you know you just put down Lambs
6:18:38
or Spite and then you definitely can't die there you go yeah sure at least for a little bit um I wonder like are we
6:18:45
just going to see he's actually going to play mid corki and they're going to grab NY wow NY Cory does not make me happy
6:18:51
however they're going to lock it in well I mean corki could be playing in the bottom Lane still cuz like you said there's no or like you're implying
6:18:57
there's no CC setup with the cork so Jack's going to go over oh BR there's
6:19:03
that Brum like I was talking about the level one is super powerful and it's strong into corki specifically as well
6:19:08
in the bottom Lane so does feel like a really nice setup here for the DN Freaks
6:19:13
and uh this would mean that it is mid corki yeah unless it's mid ezu uh which
6:19:18
could be another thing suppose that that you could be right I would that wouldn't fill me with joy either no no there's
6:19:24
only been a few players that have made mid Ezreal work um and it was not this year yeah I mean showmaker did okay yep
6:19:32
but otherwise the pick has been pretty mid um so to speak well B um
6:19:38
yeah uh spans yeah let's see what they want to take away from Bulldog like azir
6:19:44
is still available and has been very heavily prioritized here in Korea we saw it once in the
6:19:50
LPL at least the games I've seen yeah do you think that maybe this ja could be a flex is there a possibility no I don't
6:19:58
think so all right so I mean I I guess it's technically possible but I really don't think so
6:20:04
um no pii le in yeah he has lent towards that one of course when he was in na
6:20:10
playing against T1 in the world championship that lease in game was so good are we just going to keep Banning
6:20:17
leen's supports here in the bottom Lane well and now that you picked Braum I think you kind of want to right cuz uh
6:20:23
it's not necessarily these I don't know gagy ones that you really want to be maybe like Karma question yeah like
6:20:30
something like that I actually think that Ezra AMA could be really powerful yeah I I I would be kind of a fan of it
6:20:37
um it doesn't Empower NY very well but still a strong pick here yeah you do
6:20:43
need setup CC that's a very good point ital is coming out of the Jungle so it is Lee and Vigo that are both going to
6:20:49
be banned away you can see uh yosik's like oh man why me as that is yes five
6:20:55
junglers that have been banned wait how many junglers five 6 7 8 9 are there any
6:21:01
cheeky flex junglers no so nine nine jungl have been B you go I wonder what
6:21:08
he's going to end up going with here because he has a lot of wild picks uh as
6:21:13
I suppose that might have been a support band towards that maai there for L hens oh and actually these bands here puts
6:21:19
that's 11 right cuz you got gragas and Malcolm Y and Rumble 12 Leona jungle was
6:21:25
the thing that one time is it just going to be Nar here I think it fits the bill but it's
6:21:30
not a lot of setup W that's fun that's a that's an old King in favorite yeah just
6:21:37
eat some oranges and BK no never mind that's a Scion Scion ital is is pretty decent yeah that does stuff I guess cuz
6:21:43
your ult can lock somebody down if you can hit a big Q you can you know get speared after that it's a very nice
6:21:49
front line for three heavy damage threats later on yeah I I actually think
6:21:55
this pick is quite smart here H let's see what is going okay
6:22:00
iburn is a consideration they they could ion trist they could actually do that that I think
6:22:06
they might I mean it would be no magic damage really um but I guess ion does
6:22:11
augment you with a fair bit of magic damage I guess you want something that can burn
6:22:17
through this s like tiia could work here too Arrow into shove yeah and then you
6:22:24
get LeAndre you burn oh smolder okay we're just going to comfort
6:22:31
picks now at the end of this aren't we yeah I think that's totally fine all right what's it going to
6:22:36
be I just give it to me L we need it I mean they need something to set up the N
6:22:42
I guess yeah land cocon it's non committal Mo oh he it's a blitz spring
6:22:49
never mind okay so this is this is still a fun one still one that uh lens is extraordinarily good at gives them some
6:22:56
setup but I feel like it is like it's feast or famine here on the side of Nong
6:23:01
shim and the DN freaks they have the uh insurance policy I feel like it's very
6:23:08
difficult for the late game of of nim red Force to find success from behind
6:23:15
into Dean freaks' composition I would have said the same thing about games one and two with the scenarios we had and
6:23:21
the game got pretty crazy but when you look at ior and brush control the scaling of smolder which is you know
6:23:28
vastly going to outpace ultimately what Ezreal and Cori can do they really need to make sure they don't botch getting to
6:23:34
the two item spikes for both of their Morana Champions and then they need to be able to to ride and Coast that into a
6:23:40
really significant Advantage because as we've seen with iburn for all time you get advantages especially with the Deep
6:23:45
wards that we have now four Health on the ward you're just shoving more and more and more Vision if you end up being
6:23:51
behind against a team and it's like chem Tech Soul you're really doomed um so the
6:23:56
scaling aspect here is not it's not like the the composition of nim has no scaling but it is certainly going to to
6:24:03
fall off when we reach a certain point we've been having longer games today I'm going to have to lean towards Dean
6:24:08
freak's comp I think it's strong early with the ash Brom I think it's extremely strong late from ahead with a small Lo
6:24:14
yeah I would agree and I don't think I mind too much about the lack of engage um just because smolder just tends to do
6:24:22
a whole lot of things as the game goes on but we'll just have to see how it goes because honestly it's been hard to
6:24:27
predict today let's get into it
6:24:41
oh Junction fans pretty loud here today as we can see already the Braum Ash team
6:24:47
looking to invade early does make a little bit of sense yeah but uh well respected looking
6:24:56
to cut down the forest with the Lumberjack Scion skin I respect it um berserker's just Tak Tak the
6:25:05
scenic route to a lane swap it looks like I do kind of like that Berserker is kind of their only engage because it
6:25:11
felt like he was that only engage in game one as well and the way he did it was to just jump forward a bunch of
6:25:17
times I mean when you consider Jax as a pseudo engage it's not and he's not even going to Lan swap either he just really
6:25:22
wanted to get somebody's flash at level one I mean look at where lens and gu are they're like let's take the very safe
6:25:29
path to the Lane uh but yeah the ways in which you can follow up on like Arrow
6:25:35
into a route from piosik and then set up a Counter Strike I mean there are ways y
6:25:40
Broms engage is not our favorite but it it certainly can um be well when it's with an Ivan right like if you actually
6:25:47
land the trigger seed then you can get a bro ultimate into a pretty good position with the uh the extra Mobility that you
6:25:53
kind of get there so I don't mind it life just going to be moving up towards
6:25:58
lens who throws out a hook and doesn't find the Target and that is not a great start but
6:26:05
often times you need a few calibration hooks yeah ASA peanut I think he's still
6:26:10
cting PE peanut is still calibrating now however um I could imagine that once the calibration is complete everything's
6:26:16
going to be fantastic we'll see how long it takes lens uh to get the calibration sorted as it is off cool down once
6:26:24
again well uh life he just likes to use his coold Downs at level one like I said and so far so good he's adding some
6:26:31
extra poke damage and the ash level one ending up being strong again we'll keep track of Bulldog's Stacks with our new
6:26:38
UI it's much easier to see like in the past of the lck we be like when will they click on it um but now we can just
6:26:44
see it in real time which is really nice uh cion could save off a lot of pressure in this matchup but isn't going to be
6:26:50
doing any winning and no it's more of not losing what you want to be
6:26:56
doing a bit of a demolish procu there from Dudu who is just going to wander behind the turret I feel like this is
6:27:02
his natural habitat though right like on split Pusher something like a Jax that can really affect the late game in more
6:27:08
of a sid Lane capacity feels pretty D esque yeah feels very dind esque as well
6:27:13
but digress yeah I think that one of the things I really love about this composition for dnf is that the Jax does
6:27:20
a great job of buying you time in a mid game oh almost almost not able to find
6:27:26
the Smite but still just going to be uh peacefully moving on over and having a conversation with some of these uh camps
6:27:34
yeah well when the Jax gets to you know threaten side lanes and and force
6:27:39
reactions it just means smolder gets to keep stacking and the more stacking he does the more of a threat he is later on
6:27:45
and there isn't a great way to lock him down because he's pretty mobile you know he has his flap as well so he can get
6:27:52
out of almost anything that they can offer like you can avoid a blitz crank Q you can avoid a Scion knockup you can
6:27:57
avoid a scon ult so I actually really do think it the smolder pick is one we haven't talked about much recently it's
6:28:02
really fallen off it's one that was super super popular last year in the lck but and it's been nerfed a lot but it's
6:28:08
still quite strong it still scales incredibly well and it it really does feel like the perfect pick I feel like this is kind of been the the best game
6:28:15
three Tech we've seen so far I love the identification of the
6:28:20
fact that these games are going longer than we kind of expected and I like to think that rapid star also thought that
6:28:26
and he's like well I mean Bulldog's really good smold player let's just go do that again uh we saw it in kpup as
6:28:31
well like there are quite a few smold games but that was on the previous Rift right it was a slightly different
6:28:38
experience as all right got some plants going down dudo gets himself a shield it does not really a whole lot uh but
6:28:43
that's fine just trading grasps as bless you Bulldog Bulldog is one of the smolder
6:28:50
enjoyers yeah certainly is I thought it was I really kind of thought it was going to be Tristana um just with how
6:28:56
much he loved Tristana uh last year and TR ion was one of the bigest combos so
6:29:03
it sus poosi as well and I I do think this is kind of how Fearless is going to go for us in the lck cup is just when
6:29:09
you get down to Brass tax it's like all right well I like to play these Champions let's
6:29:14
go and that's what I want to see you know sometimes we just have to stay too meta lens yeah going to come on over and
6:29:21
look to punch piosik here he punched it there you go spear is going to connect there as well pios going to flash gets
6:29:26
out his shield The Flash Forward from Gideon that's first blood as Bulldog if he gets a kill here it could actually be
6:29:32
really dangerous despite First Blood going on over but no he pounces over the wall and he gets himself out of there
6:29:37
the flap comes in Oh The Flash Forward and bu collects it is it worth it we'll
6:29:42
have to find out in future see whether that flash can be punished yeah I feel like uh I mean it's definitely worth it
6:29:49
The Flash and it almost feels like despite losing first blood it's a trade up here for dnf because getting this
6:29:56
smolder accelerated and getting him to a more stable place feels amazing with
6:30:01
what this draft is trying to accomplish because you know it it's not just about
6:30:07
the the first Blood like you need a second feet of strength in order to get the upgraded boots and the other the
6:30:14
other two go hand in hand I feel like first blood is it's not as important as I thought it
6:30:20
was going to be in my mind because I feel like you can lead some objectives into a Herald and then get first turet
6:30:26
right I feel like that is sort of like the way that it kind of works and so first blood is not entirely necessary as
6:30:32
far as that is concerned but it looks like they are going to be able to grab their first objective of the game as well so Nim looking to really accelerate
6:30:39
that one as Berserker takes turret shot putting a lot of pressure on the je here as we can see yosik's coming up
6:30:45
yeah oh no good old surprise party ion well he's getting Zs with a grump
6:30:51
instead yeah well he's getting zoned off of these minions uh as a result of that so even though he doesn't die he doesn't
6:30:57
have to flash or cleanse or anything like that it's going to be Berserker grabbing a plate here and the Cs Advantage for this early game Ash
6:31:04
yeah is just incredibly huge here I mean he's sitting at 456 the gold Advantage right now and then going back to this
6:31:09
play here I mean this was you know we talked about how we're looking for something to set up the spears well a rocket punch I suppose will do and then
6:31:16
he gets the grab right afterwards K has to flash away Bulldog does so much damage he also by the way gets a ton of
6:31:22
stacks in this exchange gets his flatback online goes over the wall here and flashes for the Q just narrowly able
6:31:30
to get into Q range he is on the edge of it there yeah love the unbreakable going up immediately afterwards as well so not
6:31:36
going to be punished or anything like that the flash about a third of the cool down a little bit more has been used up
6:31:43
we'll see whether Nong shim can get some sort of uh punish play of course Gideon doesn't have his flash but Fisher does
6:31:50
uh in this mid lane so you can see Bulldog having to play pretty respectfully here Fisher's like you can't have this cannon yeah well and
6:31:56
then he gives it to him come on Fisher yeah wanted to continue the shove as all
6:32:04
right looks like there's not going to be a whole lot of jungle here for pososi as the bottom side really does look like it
6:32:09
belongs to Gideon Fisher cheating over towards the rest of his teammates makes sense but I think gives away uh the play
6:32:15
here as life moves up knows what's going on he could be in real trouble that's the hook it's going to connect onto
6:32:21
Berserker he has to flash out immediately and stand behind the ward here for life gets him out of Dodge so
6:32:28
holds on to the flash on the Braum side of things but that's a real valuable one with Berserker now not having that
6:32:33
opportunity yeah still I mean he can just return to Lane and keep putting the pressure on so it is high value but it's
6:32:39
not as high as I think Noam would have liked they really wanted to take him out here to give Jew some refree oh Arrow
6:32:45
going to connect onto lens life will be able to find that Winter's bite so L going to have to flash out as well in
6:32:51
the nick of time because those cust blows were coming through mom gets mad Fisher moves a minuscule amount of uh
6:32:58
distance to the right and that is the hard cter Bulldog uh was considering just taking a turret shot but he's like
6:33:05
I don't have any minions there's some bull walkking and stuff like that I'm not going to mess with it uh over here I mean this is a really nice with L come
6:33:14
on come come on say sorry that's stop stop stop um that was a nice hook though
6:33:19
very hook indeed I think he was saying that to himself was he yeah yeah beautifully done so uh lens
6:33:29
congratulating himself and then telling everyone that it's really not something we should do anything about so I'm a
6:33:34
little bit if I if I had to like take a a little closer look at the game State
6:33:39
you know um with like a magnifying glass not a microscope we don't have to go that deep but just like let's just say
6:33:45
eyesight's not that good I'm kind of like wait where are we so maybe you're taking a look at it with your reading glasses yeah yeah I suppose you could
6:33:51
say that sure or like you know putting the zoom function up a little bit on your browser I see the gold lead is is
6:33:58
very know favorite except for the two Champions you should be afraid of uh for for uh yeah freaks especially that
6:34:05
smolder guy and it is like as far as gold lead is concerned it is like zero pretty much it's like 100 and it's
6:34:11
dipping back and forth uh so you're right I think with the Ash and the smolder both being ahead that makes the
6:34:17
gold that dnf has a little bit more valuable because when you look at the Scion lead it's not significant but it's
6:34:23
there it's just not um it's not going to really stop the Jacks from being jacked later on so I think no should need to be
6:34:30
super proactive here the problem is they're running a composition has two two item Spike Champions that are just
6:34:37
not anywhere near their spikes right now so how this works out is is going to be really tricky and I think lens has to be
6:34:43
hitting Hooks and he has hit so many but they haven't led to Big eliminations they've led to Summoner spells but that
6:34:49
alone isn't enough I think they need to figure out how to use lens to generate some gold here for these carries to accelerate the two item spikes otherwise
6:34:56
uh you know DN freaks are kind of chilling right now I mean bulldog is sitting on 82 Stacks he just picked up
6:35:02
his Essence Reaver and he's just smoothly heading towards a mid game that he's going to feel very confident with
6:35:09
yeah I would agree and you can see that dnf are going to be able to move forward and look for this one as okay Len's
6:35:15
going to get caught out knocked off by the kitchen sink but the BR just explodes okay trade of supports but
6:35:21
where did life go yeah he's gone he's really gone but I mean this is a trade
6:35:26
up for dnf because they got Berserker the kill oh no going connect onto Gideon
6:35:31
Daisy getting mad and going to chase that cat into the brush looks like Gideon's going to have to get out of
6:35:37
there as oh no my money's on Daisy for this one the explosion of that Shield The Flash has to be invested not even
6:35:43
able to pounce over that wall as all right Kik is kind of in no man's land spear is going to connect somehow one
6:35:49
more Arcane ship going to come on through but kingan he finds the flank angle the slowest flap of your life
6:35:55
there for Bulldog ain't going to save him and The Lumberjack to the rescue
6:36:01
Will mean objective number two here for that's right dnf didn't get any of these grubs so it's going to be six grubs for
6:36:07
Nim so denying all of the grubs from the Jacks as well as getting that second objective for Feats of Strength that you
6:36:13
mentioned now they just need to get this Dragon bottom side and they get Feats of Strength so this is a huge turnaround
6:36:18
here looked great for dnf but chasing a bit too deep there especially piosik I have to say on this Iver backfires in a
6:36:26
big way because the beginning of this is great it's easy you know life's like cool I'm coming in here he's engaged bra
6:36:31
with this ash Arrow he's very happy with this and Bulldog is getting stacks on stacks on Stacks in this fight as well
6:36:37
so he's just sitting here going all right cool this is great with me GI a little bit vulnerable here but then they change targets on Gideon he gets rooted
6:36:44
but he's nly so he's super mobile and then they just Chase way too far instead of just saying all right let's set up to
6:36:49
control this objective and this is where things get a little bit haywired pii's on the wrong side of the ri then they
6:36:54
double down on trying to save him and it's just unsuccessful with a Teleport coming through here did he have flash
6:37:00
that whole time I think P had flash that whole time just didn't really find an angle and he he ja was waiting for him
6:37:05
to show up and knew he was missing backed and then teleported in as well if I'm not mistaken so he also lost his
6:37:12
teleport now let's kills to a Scion so game State here is still not horrible
6:37:18
for for dnf but this is a still a huge win because the grubs now allow fer to just delete turret plates here and a Jax
6:37:25
without these is just so neutered compared to what he could be to late game and with six grubs like I mean I'm
6:37:31
saying that Canon's even a split Pusher that and going to be building up a whole of
6:37:37
tanky items and Gideon looking to steal away is going to him though as the blast cone will get Gideon into the wrong
6:37:43
direction Kosik will turn up lens trying to offer something as well as the arrow connects and that is the kill onto the N
6:37:51
Daisy comes out now we getting serious here as she punches jiu one time and
6:37:56
then uh backs away yeah well that's another pick here and dnf have just been
6:38:02
so proactive with the composition that's not necessarily uh you so early game Focus I
6:38:07
mean Ash is so good in the early game at level one with Braum and stuff like that but they're turning this into a pick comp as we approach the mid game and all
6:38:15
the while Bulldog is just laning against the Scion which is uh pretty hard to miss um with your Aus and and your
6:38:21
stacking so he's feeling pretty good about it hit that 125 break point so
6:38:26
feeling very good about the current game State and I think Nim you look at the
6:38:32
again the two item spikes for fer and jiu they're so far away they both have their triforces their tiers are stacking
6:38:38
and there will be a moment where they're sitting on those two items where they can compete with the smolder but they really need to maximize that window
6:38:45
incredibly well yeah and that's what I'm most worried about here Atlas I'm a bit worried about it as well although I'm
6:38:51
looking at you know bulldog and the fact that he's stacking pretty quickly doing okay I feel like they are kind of
6:38:57
intentionally not worrying too much about the Feats of Strength because they know that they have a scaling composition so maybe they're feeling all
6:39:03
right this was a great moment though this is showing what dnf composition can do because if they do manage to find
6:39:08
someone out of position they get it done and I mean it's a good attempt here because you're NY versus uh ivn so you
6:39:14
should be able to to you know try to abuse I's clear timings and get into his jungle and start to punish and and and
6:39:21
use your fast clear speed to take some of those camps away but unfortunately uh you can get punished you know if you get
6:39:28
caught like that I mean the Jack CC the the ash CC we talked about it earlier like how much cc is in dnf it's a little
6:39:34
bit awkward but they're utilizing it incredibly well and consistently well throughout this early to mid game yeah
6:39:40
and I feel like it is like the the followup ease that you have with something like an enchanted Crystal Arrow like it is such a clear go button
6:39:47
and everyone knows that it's going to press the let's kill more immediately as soon as that one comes in so can
6:39:53
certainly work speaking of which The Flash has to be invested and you'll get that every time I don't think valkyri is
6:39:59
fast enough or unless you see it a little bit earlier fish going to be able to make sure that he
6:40:05
gets out scotf free and after the game that he had previously on the Victor you cannot really blame him as all no J that
6:40:11
was not the Arcane shift you were looking for concussive blows comes down the UL is perfect sometimes life comes
6:40:17
at you fast my friend and J is going to suffer the brunt of it as Spears coming on in Gideon going to have to get out of
6:40:23
there kingan might be able to get first turret which is going to mean Feats of Strength Galore here fim as the rocket
6:40:30
uh the The Rock what is it called it's the the the the hook yeah rocket grab right rocket grab why did I not remember
6:40:37
what grab was my brain only has room for so many things apparently and the ivone
6:40:43
is going to be able to take down the cloud Drake Cloud Drake still in there as it turns out who would have thought
6:40:48
yeah um first dragon of the game by the way oh wow yeah and that is also every
6:40:54
is so wait hang on they denied the cloud Drake yeah uh so there they go they
6:40:59
didn't manage to get first turret though so it is all three they almost got like all three R they were very close but got
6:41:06
two of them though so Nim going to be able to complete it it would have been like cuz it stops counting them right
6:41:12
does it stop counting yes it does yeah so this is about the best you're going to see as far as uh getting all of the
6:41:18
Feats of Strength yeah I mean they still have a gold lead here they got that turret top side but remember two kills on the Scion is where a lot of that gold
6:41:26
is and I think this game state is very unfavorable for Nim unless they can find some some consistent picks here it's a
6:41:33
gold lead for Fisher technically speaking but uh the the cheating of gold
6:41:38
and and how the how valuable it is is going to happen here very soon for Bulldog when he starts burning People's Health out including this tanky Sion in
6:41:46
a few moments time here maybe a pick here yeah lens does he get the hook no he doesn't but man he gets a Flash and
6:41:53
now the followup is in Kosik the one that flashes this time but unfortunately Bulldog didn't come with an extra charge
6:42:00
and so that is the turret going down at the same time dud going to try and trade on the other side of the map but man the
6:42:07
proactive play here from this Nim composition is really working beautifully it really is I mean they are
6:42:13
getting some punishes here super bizarre the way that that was handled as Yu unfortunately here um Arcane shifts in
6:42:22
he just has I mean there's a control ward in that brush so he had some limited information but it was a very
6:42:27
greedy choice and he was punished for it promptly and then he's like okay I'm I'm going to look for it I'm going to look
6:42:32
for it and yeah there it is think he knew that
6:42:39
the flash is down there as well so he can get himself out but really nicely done collecting The Flash response there from uh from
6:42:47
Bulldog it's a little bit odd but does not end up getting out safe Daisy wasn't
6:42:53
enough to turn that one around either unfortunately you can't block the S with a d yeah bit sad so I mean looking at
6:43:02
this still winable for Nim and it's kingan who's kind of kept them in this
6:43:08
and I I think that like this is still like Nim need to keep up this pace if they keep up this pace it's feeling real
6:43:14
good they're a minute away from potentially and uh atakan extra few turrets to really push this snowball
6:43:21
forward of course it is a place we have seen games thrown before even in this series so they do have to be careful
6:43:28
there are more opportunities to push a game forward if you do have a foothold I wonder the okay so fer got his second
6:43:34
item now I wonder how much gold J has right now because if he can also get Morana here that double item Spike
6:43:40
before the uh you know 225 is hit here for bulldog and get Aon out of it like
6:43:47
that fight they win that one then they're they're in the driver seat again completely in this game and J is so
6:43:52
close to Max stacks on his tier as well so as soon as he completes this he's going to be he's got to be so close to
6:43:57
finishing it you know he did buy boots uh so maybe that's going to make it a little bit more I see but he's pretty
6:44:04
strong he is also 30 CS behind so missing a lot of that farm so maybe he needs a little bit more time here so he
6:44:10
doesn't have it just yet but doesn't mean that dnf is going to start it up before he gets it and he not in a
6:44:15
position to do so Dudu is wishing so badly that he had grubs but I don't think he needs them to take this turret
6:44:21
out he has teleport and onim are going to try to take this Harold yeah so the herald will be
6:44:27
secured dud is going to split push to his heart's content though it's actually kind of big
6:44:33
the fact that dud can actually be useful in a sid Lane really be helping out because if Nim are forced to group up to
6:44:39
make their composition work then it can be a problem is all right life just going to tank it up don't hook Brom he's
6:44:45
got a big door he doesn't care Doo finds a flank angle and they're going to lock down the Sion who takes a lot of Killing
6:44:53
In fact maybe too much killing and finally he does go down Berserker with that Q activated doing a lot of damage
6:44:59
as you is able to keep himself safe and the zombie is not going to do enough at all and dnf come alive here at 20
6:45:06
minutes yeah I just I don't fully understand the thought process on this one from Nim but looking for a pick
6:45:12
starting to feel the pressure they had just taken the herald they weren't fully grouped for a pick there and Braum is
6:45:18
ready for the reengage so like look at where corki and naly are right now on
6:45:23
the mini map when this is happening Gideon Gideon comes down here but you hook the Brom you're already so low bu
6:45:30
has life actually with some great movement puts himself in front I think it was once again lens going for the ash
6:45:36
but wasn't able to get there you got to be so careful about making moves like that when you don't have full control
6:45:42
now that the herald doesn't necessarily get the value they were hoping for and
6:45:47
we'll see if they find a good angle for period basically in this game as you can
6:45:52
see the gold lead back now in Dean freaks but it's again more about the number of stacks on Bulldog more than it
6:45:59
is about the gold that's the big concern here the ash is already well and truly online on Two and a Half
6:46:05
items and still no Mor here for JE yeah not quite able to get that one done I
6:46:11
don't think he's actually being backed has he oh he did he bought his uh he finished the cor field so unfortunately
6:46:17
just didn't have very much money yeah he's I mean he's super low Eco with the lack of Cs I suppose is the main thing
6:46:22
here has doesn't have any kills there's the herald drop here feels so against the play doesn't it with the
6:46:28
herald going down in favor of nim like you'd expect them to have a bit more control dead lens is running away
6:46:35
Gideon's just going to be left out to the Wolves will make that the dragons his mom comes down and eats him almost
6:46:40
out yet kingan what's he tanking for nobody else is sticking around and he is
6:46:46
just going to be left out as dnf I think it looks to me like Nong shim have just
6:46:51
kind of ran out of URS they've ran out of you know what to do I mean that's the Bulldog finishing his Stacks as well I
6:46:58
think that's the game well very likely off of that play and and they Dro heral
6:47:04
and it's just completely ignored and man life has had such a fantastic and fun game here on this Ram he just doesn't
6:47:10
care about anything and the alss we're seeing for Bulldog have been phenomenal yeah and we have to go back to the first
6:47:16
game as well life looking real good life almost being able to steal a red bu kind of hilarious as Aon is going to be
6:47:22
secured here by dnf and and let's give Berserker credit where it's oh 100% his arrows have been so good this game and
6:47:29
with how good Berserker was in the first game would he get player of the match right now he's 100% my vote something
6:47:36
crazy changes and and yes Bulldog is going to do the big boom boom but I'm not I don't think I can be a boom boom
6:47:41
goer here cuz he's been so empowered by that Arrow it's just the arrow and there have been so many of them just
6:47:48
completely ignore the the heral cuz they're like doesn't matter about our mid turret we've already gotten past the tough part Bulldog's already stacked so
6:47:54
we just don't care and out off this fight and hitting cion a lot he does finish those Stacks in this moment and
6:48:01
now everything gets so much harder it was already Tough Enough yeah now they have an extra life it's you know hextech
6:48:08
dragon is up here but it's the second dragon of the game with 24 minutes in like neither of these teams have any interest League of Legends now is so
6:48:15
crazy with the fact that yeah we're 24 minutes in with two Dres no one's no one cares about Drake anymore as Berserker
6:48:21
and Bulldog both doing a lot of damage this game kind of amazing that uh a uh smolder is topping the damage at 24
6:48:28
minutes you feel like that should take a little while longer to come in but that is is just the game State yeah and it's
6:48:37
Mountain soul but I don't think smolder really cares no with his uh percentage
6:48:43
base burn I think he would like to have it himself yeah that could be pretty huge he does have a two dragon lead the
6:48:50
question is do we get to four dragons in this game yeah um cuz yeah it's a smaller game but he's already online
6:48:57
quite early and his teammates are as well and the Jax has three kills and doesn't have any grubs but car's less
6:49:02
about that than he did earlier on Baron spawns and dnf are like it's mine yeah
6:49:08
let's just take it on spawn of course spawning 5 minutes later than it used to as Berserker he's got some volleys to
6:49:16
keep them out of here lens certainly does need to be respected somewhat for these hooks that can bring a priority
6:49:22
Target in but as you can see here Nong shim not pulling the trigger just yet and it's dnf that are going to do so fer
6:49:28
immediately going to get M as lens at least gets that one done I don't know about that one Doo his mom comes down
6:49:34
but H still going to die mom does so much damage and look at this with the ivone this Jack is just Immortal both of
6:49:41
them going golden Gideon going to get eaten by a dragon you can see Bulldogs going to be a to take him out dogs
6:49:47
versus cats I guess it's going to be Bulldog that comes out on top and this one is okay that's a fully charged Q remember none of them can die ladies and
6:49:54
gentlemen they've still got out of car they have the withdrawal so it doesn't matter like I mean Dudu saved his uh
6:49:59
life or his withdraw by going for the uh armu to keep himself in the fight so he
6:50:05
don't want to waste time teleporting back in he had teleport so if he did die he could have just come back he is going to come back right now and uh you know
6:50:12
at this point I think bulldog's like I would like some more yeah they know exactly where J is as dudo comes on over
6:50:20
the door just eats the true shot barrage this Brum has been such an incredible pick and they get in there you can see
6:50:27
kingan trying to utilize that ultimate to lock them down as Len's not going to be stealing that one away that's going
6:50:33
to be the baron secured by piosik kingan is now a zombie as Bulldog just trying
6:50:38
to Flap his way away and will be able to do so the Sphere not going to connect jiu able to offer back a lot of damage
6:50:44
here as Dudu does need to be a little bit careful as the auu just barely not able to get him as oh the arrow for the
6:50:51
snipe doesn't quite get in there but the damage has been done the baron has been secured and Berserker is already utilizing it in the mid lane Bulldog's
6:50:57
about to have his ult back too it was a real world where maybe something uh could have happened there with could
6:51:02
have looked for a snipe there on those retreating no members but I mean with
6:51:08
Baron up they already got 3,000 gold nearly with it it's just what do you do in the situation as Nim you're you're
6:51:14
struggling as lens because you can't get an angle to grab the baron and Daisy are working against you fer is in is in no
6:51:21
man's line he can't actually get close to anybody to hit any priority targets they all have res anyways and the ult
6:51:27
from Bulldog have been so clean so high value in these choke points all game long this is that uh
6:51:33
hourglass or rather the arm guard I was talking about like a temped fate with the fact that they used it in such good timing yeah and then you know you're
6:51:39
sitting here going what do I do like I can't I can't do anything there's there's nothing here there's no tools
6:51:46
there's no n there's no Smite but we're still trying to to be around this smolder and it's a bad time well lens is
6:51:52
going to get a hook onto a Brom and this time he's dead um nicely done so they
6:51:58
managed to take down life for 40 seconds that might stop this push I feel like the Brum is extremely valuable for this
6:52:04
composition they've already got 2600 gold on the Red Bull Baron power play and so a lot of the damage has been done
6:52:11
but that will put a dampener into it a smolder just gets stronger and stronger though it it slows the game but it
6:52:18
doesn't it doesn't make things any better unless you can get really a team Fight Win somehow you need to to get multiple members yeah and I leen's
6:52:25
grabbing a smolder is just optimistic at best when
6:52:30
this braah has been doing such a good job when Daisy is so frustrating to deal with when he has flap and he's fairly
6:52:36
mobile he can get over walls he can just stay away from you and still be such a pain to deal with I mean he can utilize
6:52:41
minions to increase his range he can utilize kingan to increase his range and just keep queuing you and harassing you
6:52:46
we've just seen that in the lck when smolders get online pretty you know
6:52:52
relatively easily without any problems you don't come back from that we've very rarely seen comeback games I
6:52:59
mean G was like I once I got online with smolder the game in for like over an hour not to mention the fact that
6:53:05
Berserker can do things like this now that he has the big old Shield life diving into so many people but look at
6:53:10
the value of the door it is disgusting how much this does as lens yeah that
6:53:15
rocket punch not doing too much of anything and now Dudu feeling Immortal himself as long as he has that gentleman
6:53:21
tree around him and he's going to go golden there utilizing that zus repaired his arm guard quite nicely but the
6:53:27
turret is getting angry and finally he is going to go down Bulldogs are full health though and N shim I think they're
6:53:33
losing an inhibitor turret at least because Berserker is just by himself in the bottom Lane yeah he just doesn't
6:53:39
care they don't even have grubs but we're at the point of the game where these turrets just don't last long down
6:53:45
goes one inhibitor and a second inhibitor turret will fall I mean I
6:53:50
suppose there's a world where maybe they could defend this if Berserker was more vulnerable but he's got flash yeah life
6:53:56
needs to really save him here though cuz there are a lot of people coming that's four uh I think life might be dead and
6:54:02
cker is also dead hook so double kill there have a jiu it is going to be an inhibitor in trade for it they didn't
6:54:09
get that inhibitor in fact did so that was possibly a little bit of a misstep there is a mountain dragon up
6:54:16
and available I suppose you know the series is just going to be messy no matter what is
6:54:22
there any game stage that is unable cuz I'm starting to believe that
6:54:28
there is you mean like there's there's there's definitely a way that dnf could throw
6:54:34
this game and still lose yeah I'm not ready to get like all religious like
6:54:41
you you know my mom would tell me like anything is possible and I just roll my eyes like that's kind of how I feel but
6:54:46
let's see let's see I mean look I I thought there was no world where they didn't get both Inhibitors and at least I'm in good company with my uh my
6:54:53
somewhat spiritual take on how this game could go um I don't want to watch this again
6:54:58
but we are yeah do ever extended a little bit and then with we're going to get a bit of a fast forward and then
6:55:03
life from Berserker are just going to die yeah there's no collapse here um to
6:55:09
try to cuz like Jax is dead so there's just not really a whole lot of heal for Berserker and it was it was a good
6:55:15
punish play there from the side of nim and uh L's hitting the hook everything
6:55:20
lines up he's got his mes completed he's got an Elixir he's ready for the team
6:55:27
fight on this Baron like the okay is it possible is atlas is Atlas on to something here like
6:55:34
anything is throwable well life is going to show them the door and he's going to get hooked in and he's going to die atas
6:55:41
I need to stop telling life how valuable and cool he is cuz it seems to have a negative impact on how things are going
6:55:48
for him in the game yeah um we we call them cter curses don't we we certainly
6:55:53
that's usually the accepted term in our industry for this type of moment where you praise someone and they immediately
6:55:59
are either punished or make a mistake they were called in 2025 you know cuz we hadn't hadn't quite get got there yet it
6:56:07
was uh just carler in our group chat I'm pretty sure on the day well uh Baron is up in 15 Nim do
6:56:16
have cryo Lio respawn in 5 seconds they're trying to just threaten the back
6:56:21
door uh but I don't know they're a little bit split here looks like front door to me sure I I mean yeah but you
6:56:28
know what I'm saying yeah well Daisy's getting amongst it and King is just holding the wave as
6:56:34
best he can no more Baron available as you wow okay pldog they need to avoid
6:56:41
everything Bulldog does that's really important and like you say life is just going to get into position once again he
6:56:47
can soak a hook but he needs the rest of his team to be there to follow up if he does indeed do so I mean they can just
6:56:53
say all right you do Baron we'll do Baron for Nexus trade D's trying to set up for it clearing these waves super
6:56:58
minion wave is very uh fer is taking % of his health bar for no
6:57:03
reason just going to just going to say go away Fisher and um now the baron pryo
6:57:11
belongs to the DN freaks okay oh L hands I thought he was going to do it I thought he was going to
6:57:17
go in as life is going to get snagged by a spear oh it could
6:57:23
be they don't go for it this this composition doesn't have a strong tank
6:57:29
dnf so they're so scared of starting Baron somebody getting hooked and them getting like you know isolated Crow oh
6:57:34
Arrow going to connect there on J but he does get cleansed immediately now Dudu diving into that backline fer in a bit
6:57:40
of trouble dud goes golden Gideon now he's going to get cleansed as well goes golden as well and now J's running out
6:57:47
of button that he can press aring ship Flash not enough as dnf closed in and
6:57:53
with the jungle and AD carry both dead King is going to try and hold on to the wave to keep this game alive it is not
6:58:01
going to work out down he goes and it's Bulldog that's gifted the prize of the kill money it's completely unnecessary
6:58:08
because they're about to take down the Nexus okay uh Fisher doing the fakeer threat and valky is is way to taking out
6:58:15
that super minion but another wave comes through here leens grab one of those minions away buy some time all right
6:58:23
next is turret number one going to go down lens's not going to be doing anything Fisher as well grasping at straws to say the least and that's a
6:58:30
bare Nexus that is going to be a game win for dnf able to keep things
6:58:36
interesting as far as our groups as well Baron won Elder one at the end of today
6:58:43
but I think you could argue that these are two upsets here today considering the caliber of players that we see on
6:58:50
this nonm roster as well as bro and how good they looked uh it's a crazy lck cup
6:58:57
so far yeah this new patch is wild you just don't know what to expect it looks like no team is is fully prepared for
6:59:05
Fearless draft at least of these four that we've seen so far I mean you have your own style and I thought that the uh
6:59:12
smolder pick was a really nice touch but I feel like we haven't seen too many master classes like that one just yet
6:59:17
it's a lot of comfort that teams have gone back to and so it gets really interesting and it gets really volatile
6:59:23
uh in these game States so yeah dude do hitting that DN logo DN fans are shy but
6:59:31
but happy for and uh they're trying to get used to it you know like the qu freaks last year weren't necessarily uh our top teams but
6:59:39
right now this squad is currently leading in the lck cup yeah with the victory here with this win we are tied
6:59:46
Baron and Elder both at plus one so it's dead even going into day two and you
6:59:53
love to see it competitive groups uh competitive series terms of the score
6:59:58
line not to mention in terms of the games as well we've had long games and back and forth yeah and the amount of
7:00:04
times Feats of Strength have come in and then the team that didn't get them has just kind of crushed just like we just
7:00:10
saw uh has been much higher than I was expecting so I'm I'm feeling real positive about how the game state looks
7:00:17
uh moving into the rest of the week because these games have been crazy I loved it yeah I I have to say I was most
7:00:23
impressed with Berserker today on the DN freaks I did give him my vote uh even though Bulldog did a lot of boom boom
7:00:29
damage and it was a team effort and piosik set him up really well uh and life had a fantastic final game here I
7:00:36
think the arrows were really the big story here for me in this one and then obviously his performance on kalista
7:00:42
earlier on in the day which saved them with with what seemed like an unwinable game yeah was uh enough to give me his
7:00:49
or for me to give him my vote it's the power of Na Talent man got Berserker coming on over we got Mark coming in as
7:00:56
well and dnf off to a one and zero start in the lck cup I think it's just it's
7:01:03
proof right yeah sure I'm going to I'm going to give it to it because they
7:01:09
played exceptionally well feel like Berserker here in this moment uh King out very nicely but honestly it's the
7:01:15
way dnf sort of recognize what their composition does and then play to it almost to a t like to a fault right you
7:01:22
saw in in their very first game Berserker went for that play because he knew that the kalist to jump forward
7:01:28
keep jumping forward is the way that we're going to be able to win because don't have a lot of answers to if that
7:01:34
uh the ren set comes in after the bailout I will you know I I will address
7:01:39
the elephant in the room we had some some rough drafts today uh we we had actually almost every game there was a
7:01:46
rough draft uh on one side or the other we also should address that you know NOA
7:01:51
made some big mistakes in this game the N plus no real setup in bottom or in mid
7:01:57
didn't really hit the mark for us didn't have a huge impact except stealing some camps away so it wasn't the highest
7:02:02
level we will see but we'll see that in the coming days as teams get used to this patch and you can see how hyped these guys are for closing out what was
7:02:08
an incredibly tense Series yeah not to mention the fact that the more Champions that get involved right the more we're
7:02:14
going to see teams practicing different picks right so they can have like these extended Quivers that you're going to
7:02:21
need in order to win in felis so Bulldog 36k damage absolutely massive fish are
7:02:26
doing a decent amount of poke this game as well but honestly for me uh I'm with you wolf I think that Berserker played
7:02:33
absolutely amazingly even in a more utility uh type style here that we saw in this last
7:02:39
game na Talent dude na Talent sure yeah uh not Korea talent that like gets sent
7:02:46
to Na and then comes back later na Talent no no no I think the life started last year wasn't that right not like a
7:02:52
player who won worlds and then went to Na and then came back it's definitely it's na that does it yeah the the
7:02:58
hyperbolic Time Chamber of uh of North America um but whatever happened I think Berserker has been absolutely fantastic
7:03:04
he was good in Challenger went over to na we didn't know whether we'd see him again but he comes back joins danan
7:03:10
Freaks and looks pretty good whilst doing it and in fact this roster in general is uh is really really fun and
7:03:16
he is going to pick up player of the match as you can see here 52 and five on the kist I think the most impressive of
7:03:22
his games but even on the Kaiser he found some angles despite the loss yeah I mean they arguably could have won game
7:03:29
two and should have won game two yeah and uh had an impressive kalista and kind of helped turn the game around for
7:03:36
his team in game one there were definitely some some votes you could have gone you could have gone support I think he arguably could have gone mid or
7:03:42
top so it it's just a team effort but Berserker to me was the big standout yep
7:03:47
absolutely fantastically played there by Berserker and now we get to chat to him so he is here for the
7:03:56
translation thank you very much guys this is dear for the P interview translation joined by B on the side of
7:04:03
group de who secured a victory in the second match of 2025 LC
7:04:11
cup you just won your first match of L cup and became the player of the match
7:04:17
congratulations how do you feel this my first stage in the L and I
7:04:23
thought that today's first match would be really important and coming into LK I really
7:04:29
wanted to have play matches and play games that I just
7:04:36
don't regret and I think there are a lot of moments where I died but I didn't
7:04:42
power away I think I just stayed grave and kept playing my
7:04:54
game from the first match it was quite neck and neck so how did it feel playing
7:05:00
on the stage really honest all three games today I didn't
7:05:06
really think that it would get dragged out this long but it was our first match of the
7:05:11
season and I think everyone's just a little nervous and I think next time we'll be
7:05:18
able to be more capable of snowballing the game and then pulling off cleaner
7:05:26
games and after Dean freaks picked Ash BR bot the enemy locked in blitzcrank so
7:05:33
how did you react to
7:05:38
this St was implemented seon and it's because we were Banning we
7:05:46
ended up Banning Leona Nautilus and that really left no options I think that's just
7:05:53
something that he had to play maybe some comt and despite you being the backline
7:06:02
you positioned to always go in first to make some feisty place so what is the source of this
7:06:10
aggression I guess you could call it
7:06:16
agression other than kaisa there were a lot of the a lot of the Champions that I played today were
7:06:23
just playmaking Champions that I can just play without a
7:06:28
team and I think I'm pretty content with my performance today with those
7:06:36
Champions I think it's just rather than responsibility I'm just doing what is
7:06:41
what my job really entails me to do you guys had a really clean bot Duo
7:06:47
performance today so how would you rate your Synergy with life we've been practicing for a while
7:06:54
now so I I would say that we're at 60 to 70% of our potential Life as a player as a is a
7:07:02
very fun person so I enjoying my time playing with him do you want to send any
7:07:07
message to life I think we lost a little bit of
7:07:13
focus at the last game so we ended up getting picked off but let's just get
7:07:18
back on our feet and do even better next time and your next opponent isia please
7:07:23
share your resolution DK has aiming and I consider
7:07:30
aiming as one of the top 8 carries in the LC and being able to face such a great 8
7:07:37
car in the L so soon makes it even more fun and that's the end of the interview from B and back to the space thank
7:07:47
you thank you very much dear for that wonderful translation as it is the D and
7:07:53
Automotive freaks getting their first Victory here in the lck cup and making sure the score is tied between group
7:08:01
group Elder and group Baron welcome back to the space Deon alongside Chronicle oox as we take a look at the player of
7:08:07
the match votes and quotes between everyone go ahead show what you got here
7:08:13
and oh only one denter here on the English analyst desk there it is that's
7:08:19
right opposite votes here hey there we
7:08:25
go I was actually contemplating this a lot and I went back and I stand by it I think Dudu in all three games when you
7:08:32
look at the team fights played impeccably I think he was one of the big reasons why they would get won game
7:08:38
number one he was able to get on gu consistently and uh I think in this Jack was a little bit less flash but even the
7:08:43
catch that ended the game was him so I think he played a really good game but it's fine sometimes you got to take the
7:08:49
hit yeah I just believe in na Talent you know uh thank
7:08:55
you I can't believe I got 10 out of 11 and I'm still not the biggest idiot on
7:09:00
the death that's a true American Patriot right there representing the LCS well form of
7:09:08
the LCS yeah LCS Talent North America Talent Uncle Sam would be proud I am
7:09:13
proud I'm so happy for Berserker in his journey and the first step here with the
7:09:18
Victory and then you can see quotes that we had from our uh fellow Korean broadcast Giga Chad 8C Master Cass I
7:09:27
love this they're all leaning into it what else do we got we over some of the other quotes that we had for them I'm
7:09:32
waiting for cl ah I was hoping for cloud Templars again Cloud Templar really is kind of the maybe we can get it later
7:09:38
kind of the goat he was my favorite comment earlier on and uh I I got to say particularly with dnf even in this
7:09:45
series I think looking a bit shaky when it comes to the performance of bulldog and fosik in case piosik and Bulldog
7:09:51
really shouldn't be too much of a surprise uh seeing life Dudu and Berserker all this
7:09:58
consistent is a is a really good sign going into the rest of the week yeah I mean it gives a lot of Hope honestly and
7:10:04
I mean the whole series this game as well was quite Scrappy there's a lot of back and forth I do feel like uh MIM
7:10:10
didn't really help themselves uh I think a big factor for me was the blitzcrank pick made almost zero sense into this
7:10:18
team um and we saw that it went down instantly it traded for the brao that was fine this flank though from King was
7:10:24
big this was kind of the start and the end of really the successes for Nim yeah I do like King and just embrace think
7:10:31
that he should just play tanks cuz I think that most like is the case who I want to call out is GI cuz I think as
7:10:36
well as Berserker blate I think GI unfortunately and this is kind of something that started in 2024 really not able to kind of keep up
7:10:44
the level cuz in 2023 J was one of the ad car that that was insanely insanely high on and I think that he also
7:10:51
warranted that and I feel like second half of 2024 he already start started see shift and we're seeing it here as
7:10:56
well the Arin shift forward he had halfway through that ended up getting him killed while still blowing flesh and
7:11:02
cleanse that's the kind of mistakes you can't afford to make yeah and again if we're thinking back to uh game number
7:11:08
one on the zigs uh Dan literally created a segment to talk about how difficult
7:11:13
that was let's take a look at our final highlight from this game here at 20 minutes into the 22 minute team fight in
7:11:19
mid lane yeah and we're kind of seeing the issue with the the blitz you just grabbed the broom um doesn't really work
7:11:25
that great and then this composition with the smolder with the Ash with the Ivan you just just kind of Chase targets
7:11:32
down and just consistently pump damage into them it's very hard for this poke composition to deal with uh I think
7:11:39
maybe if you had a different support maybe if you a bit better at keeping some space it could work a bit but it's literally just a death ball composition
7:11:46
from uh the DM Freaks and they piled it really effectively you can see Bika positioning in a way where he's pumping
7:11:52
out damage make sure he's out of range of the knockup moves back in and then it starts getting Channel again and it
7:11:57
feels like he's just not even putting a single foot wrong lens and uh the rift heral driving those those things are
7:12:04
usually a recipe for disaster and here's another highlight of it well also Gideon unfortunately I think started the okay
7:12:10
but n is the type of character where we always talk about the N pal you need to really be able to never make a mistake
7:12:17
and there he was just like he got or or uh Brom CED and and then Ash Ed from
7:12:23
melee range so yeah we've got a couple more of those translations on berserker's uh performance we we can't
7:12:30
even fly them because Cloud Templar said I literally SED my pants looking forward
7:12:36
to his future performances and pony said an ADC who knows how to push forward finish them off Berserker so uh he made
7:12:43
quite the impression named yes right and this goes back even to 2021 when he was
7:12:49
on T1 uh has always been very aggressive so it's really fun to see him back all right let's take a look at the predictions after our first day because
7:12:58
that's right only one of us on the English broadcast got it correct everyone else went 0 and2 there is only
7:13:05
one and after finishing last place in predictions last year I'm currently in
7:13:11
first place I can't wait but at what cost do you gone I I can't wait for KT to lose to bfx tomorrow and then beat
7:13:17
Hana that's going to be great that's right I'm basking in it because last year did not go so well and we all had
7:13:24
an unironic bro pick not our fault that we got it wrong and then the North American talent that's right Uncle Sam
7:13:30
was happy and so were my predictions let's take a look at the standings here after the first day of the lck cup as it
7:13:39
is the DN freak sitting on top of the group as well as DRX on the opposite side and Baron and Elder tied up after
7:13:46
we had uh you know I I think what we assumed were maybe some of the lower end
7:13:53
matches going head to-head and if you go with the predictions it's supposed to get to 22 tomorrow because T1 is heavy
7:13:59
favorites atas the only one who went for DK uh obviously with now barrel and Shi coming in and then on the flip side
7:14:06
everyone predicted KT so might end up with the same score now both DK uh and
7:14:12
KT have a tendency to be a bit swingy in how they perform so we'll see both in
7:14:17
positive or negative sense so we'll see how that ends up playing out tomorrow I mean we definitely need to see more from these teams to scope it out but I
7:14:23
remember I was kind of leaning group Baron especially with Bros Casper performance but now like they've traded evenly and if you look at the three
7:14:29
teams that haven't played from each side bfx are kind of standing out as maybe like the the weakest there so you know
7:14:36
if we see these teams trade games a bit more I I think gopala could pull ahead but they have an aalon fah who was
7:14:42
really good for team mid when they won the season opening got to prove himself to Uncle Sam well we get to see him
7:14:48
tomorrow as bfx take on KT and then a big one the debut of Doran on T1 up
7:14:56
against young talent in shiu and plus Kia a huge huge match tomorrow in the
7:15:03
second one and every single match counts as we are stepping closer and closer to
7:15:09
the end of the lck cup but we just started 2025 lck is now underway thank
7:15:14
you so much for walking or watching as uh again it has been a lot of fun we'll
