welcome ladies and gentlemen to the lck cup the final game before we get into
27:02
the playin stage it's very very exciting and this last one still actually has a
27:07
few stakes in it as uh bnk FX unfortunately unable to pick up a win
27:12
thus far in the tournament and nongshim certainly trailing behind their team Elder Brethren that's right and for the
27:19
DN freaks they are waiting with baited breath their fate is not in their hands
27:25
it's actually in the hands of nongshim if Nim wins then they get a chance to play in the play ends if bnk win it'll
27:31
be them instead the reason why of course we bring up the standings is because they're not actually in Nim's group so
27:38
Nim is guaranteed playin by default because their group group Elder has their bottom teams going into playin by
27:45
default so weirdly enough this means that the standings here for the group Baron are kind of up to whether no wins
27:52
or not so you can see that reflected in the standings here bnk needs a win here to pass D and free
27:58
win with any score put them higher and that would knock Dean freaks out if Noam wins however that would put BN k at 05
28:06
and they would therefore be eliminated from plays exactly so still a lot on the line here and of course bnk going to be
28:12
playing for their tournament lives as you SE wolf it might mean that they'll have a little bit more fire in their belly than nongshim who would only
28:19
really have fire in their belly because of the delicious noodles that nongshim have been cooking up for them um I think
28:26
still definitely going to be coming out swinging here and wanting to pick up an extra win to give them that momentum moving into the playing stage and as you
28:33
can see here this is what wolf Illustrated just before and uh it says
28:38
it pretty plain as day if they win they're going to advance to the playing stage and the DN freaks will be
28:43
eliminated and uh if Nim win then it's Dean freaks that are going to be heading towards the playin stage so we'll see um
28:51
of course must feel feel good for b k furx to at least have their fate in their own hands even
28:58
did leave the organization that's correct um this is the matchup that we're most looking forward to here diao
29:04
versus go2 Challengers players who came up through the same time frame even though Diablo was younger didn't play in
29:09
the lck last year now he's had his debut to promising ad carries du with a pretty eclectic Champion pull some really great
29:15
scaling picks like his famous smolder dible more flashy like smash uh a little bit more Unchained of a player can get a
29:23
little bit crazy sometimes loves his Zer loves to go in and be aggressive as kaisa as well so I think we have two
29:28
different play Styles but two different very talented players are definitely going to be the key ones to look forward to for this match up this afternoon yep
29:35
I do think that there is a little bit of opposing momentum as far as the play recently for both of these players we
29:41
have seen J be like a huge pop off player this guy has carried games where
29:46
we didn't think that they were carryable um but it just hasn't happened so far in 2025 so we're waiting for it we're
29:52
waiting for those moments and in fact like his damage share compared to other 80 carries is like bottom three bottom
29:58
two something like this at the moment in the lck it's disappointing to see and we're hoping that we do get the GU back
30:04
that we are used to seeing because this guy has been a carry monster in the past and he's so adorable we want to see it
30:11
we want to see him happy want to see him come out swinging someone who has been swinging has been kinging highest damage
30:16
for any top laner in the league percentage wise in comparison to the rest of his team and uh it's been a lot
30:22
of uh how's the lck put it a lot of burden on his shoulders yeah I mean we
30:27
had him the only top laner to pick up a player of the match as well play that Gangplank series which is where a lot of
30:33
those numbers uh come from but I think what's so exciting to me about this matchup is you have two teams who
30:39
haven't really reached their potential right you have Noam on the other side who has a really cool roster you thought
30:45
gu and lens would be a match made and Heaven king and the veteran coming through and then you have B and K who I
30:50
think a lot of people were super low on this roster coming through saying with the caliber of players they built with this roster with they would be weak but
30:56
they almost beat gen they've been almost able to get so many of these wins I think they've overperformed our expectations but haven't been able to
31:03
actually close these series out sitting at a zero and four after performances we saw from them in week one and halfway
31:09
through week two you would have expected they would definitely be in the play-ins but they need to win this match up
31:14
tonight to make it happen so again two teams who haven't quite lived up to what we expect from them and uh one of them
31:20
will come out Victorious tonight for Nim no Stakes here but still you want to get that win you want to the best seed
31:26
possible you want to come with that momentum into play as well yeah and you don't want to feel like a fraud heading towards plays and I could imagine that
31:32
being bottom of your group being way away from the next team as DRX sitting on 3 and2 right now in the group and Nim
31:40
1 and three so not even able to catch up to the fourth place and a DRX that is a
31:46
team that hasn't looked all that good anyway um it's going to feel good if they manage to pick up a victory here
31:51
but we're getting ahead of ourselves we've got a match to play out and they're going to have to put their money where their mouth is one very important
31:58
thing for being K enjoyers is the fact that they have blue side they haven't been able to pick up any victories at
32:03
all on red they've been able to steal away three of them on the blue side in game twos never have they won a game one
32:10
um but blue side is certainly a a better opportunity for them so I think that the the deck is stacked in their favor right
32:17
now but that will mean that if they lose this game one I don't think it's ever going to a game three yeah I will tend
32:23
to agree with you on that we've just seen blue side gener be super dominant here in LC K cup and so having that
32:29
extra first pick is so valuable right now plus even the reply picks you have on B2 B3 give you good answers often
32:37
times to the the picks on the red side because in that first Fearless draft specifically everything is open so you
32:42
have the most chances to actually get the first pick and then two great responsive picks and deny them from your
32:48
opponent and deny them for the rest of the series as well so there's so many extra layers in Fearless as to why I think blue side right now in terms of
32:54
draft strategy has that extra Edge there's DIA the man of the afternoon we'll see if he
33:00
is going to be able to stack up against this guy GI who's not a veteran I wouldn't say just yet but definitely has
33:06
a lot more LC experience yeah it feels like he has got to veteran status though especially because it was so publicized
33:13
what that Nim roster was able to do in Challenger and then that entire team came into the lck so it sort of felt
33:20
like they were an lck team for a little bit longer if that makes sense um so G
33:26
certainly feeling like a bit of a household name here in the lck and now up alongside lens's St still trying to
33:32
figure out how he can be that big carry machine because one of the issues with playing alongside lens we've had a lot
33:38
of players deal with it over the years uh is that he just kind of leaves you to
33:44
do your own thing and an independent ad carry is hard to find you know often they do need a little bit of help uh
33:50
getting stuff going in the early stages of the game um and you I think it's a it's probably a bit of a learning
33:55
experience uh and the difficulty curve can be a bit odd when it comes to playing alongside Leen so hopefully in
34:01
this game he's going to be feeling a whole lot better as Ryu there um looking a little bit fatigued looking like uh
34:08
like it's been a rough time and he was pretty hard on himself you know blaming himself a lot for some of the award
34:14
drafts that BN K have found themselves uh facing off against so we'll see how
34:19
uh he actually manages to get into this Champions s this time around I think one of the big booms that bnk have uh here
34:25
moving into this one is that the midlane matchup I think does favor vicka quite a
34:32
bit I think even though he hasn't seen those big wins those big results just yet as a mechanical player against
34:37
Fischer who just really isn't that guy and comes online a lot later if you can draft something for uh you know via here
34:44
give a good counter pick to fiser then you're going to end up having a uh a good time at least in that lane which
34:50
has been so important so far here in lck cup mid it feels like for the last two years has been such a pivotal role in
34:56
getting you that map control yeah well here we are into the draft let's dive into game number one and see what's
35:01
going to be banned away no surprises on the red side as scanic kalista have just needed to be banned um this is where you
35:07
get somewhat flexibility uh something like you know yesterday it was Ash that
35:12
needed to be ban away uh banned away but I don't know whether that's necessarily as high priority maybe something like an
35:18
aurora could be removed uh from kingan and Fisher kingan actually been putting up some numbers on that champion as well
35:24
so removing some flexibility could be a good idea we'll see what they do decide to do is Rumble another king and aimed
35:30
ban and a good one too I wonder where are they're going to take this I mean Ash is still a strong pick far still a
35:36
strong pick you have uh the ability to just grab ambessa here all these picks will shape your drafts in different ways
35:42
so again that's the power of blue side here Nim have it and we will see what
35:48
they will opt for lot of consideration here the vi was banned by them and Aurora hasn't really been I mean before
35:55
okay there's the Amba instead but Aurora was one of those that in kespa cup was always in that spot in the first week of
36:00
lck cup was almost always in that spot but has really fallen off here quite a bit actually um towards the end of week
36:06
two and now in our final week of the group battle stage Jace is one of those
36:11
other picks that's also been super highly prioritized by our top teams that they could have gone for but we'll go over to BN K instead we'll see what they
36:19
want to grab with this could just be a strong jungle pick even something like ailia would make sense although it's not
36:24
really Raptor's thing ooh poppy going to be HED here and I was kind of pranked wolf because with the fact that it was
36:31
written as BK FX versus Nong shim on everything I assumed that it was BK that
36:36
had side selection that's not actually the case yeah Nim actually so that's why Nim are on blue side cuz I was looking
36:42
at I'm like wait they chose red are they insane and then I double checked and they do in fact have side selection for
36:49
this one I knew something wasn't wasn't right but I was like I don't know I missed something as well so apologize to
36:54
everyone but uh no no it was just that it was that's that's how it was publicized and it's a it's a little bit of a predetermined thing and like
37:00
there's some coin flipping going on figure out who gets side selection so just clarifying that one at least is loed and that does reverse everything we
37:08
said about BK having that Advantage so it makes it a little bit tougher for them here starting on red side but at least here into the poppy if it is in
37:14
fact going to be poppy support feels really nice but you don't know what the bottom matchup is just yet so this feels
37:19
almost like a trap here for no to lock this one in this early without knowing that match up and knowing that Raptor
37:25
could potentially be playing this poppy could also theoretically even be going tops as well so um probably not into the
37:31
amb doesn't sound like a fun time but either way this elase pick is very dangerous and now bnk have the
37:36
opportunity to try to set up a bottom Lane that's safe against this and also their Top Lane because it'll likely be a
37:42
lane swap the top laner has to laying against that at least can sub something more safe as well so like the Jace could now go mid um just as a result of this
37:48
Elise being shown this early not to mention the fact that it's a Kaiser as well so a lot of magic damage not really as worried about the damage profile if
37:55
that champion has been locked in opens ACH do as far as that draft is concerned and R you're going to be happy about
38:01
that because they were you know a bit shoehorned in previous drafts and so probably going to be feeling a lot
38:06
better about how this one's going the Caitlyn ban is so easy here it's so obvious because the Elise is already
38:11
loged in the Synergy with the Cocoon into trap we've seen so much you crush the lane swap you know you crush the
38:17
lane day Lane swap you you crush the top laner like you win everything so um that one they're not going to allow through
38:22
the Lilia I was mentioning earlier I think is a really wise ban here for nonam red Force as well consider we may
38:27
have that J mid double ads means he want some more magic damage even though you have the kaisa he's got great setup here
38:33
as well in this draft already you can set up shock blast set up a kaisa ult with the sleep so a lot of long range
38:39
plus the engage of the kaisa feels really good with that pick Ezreal similar situation even though kaisa has
38:44
kind of been air quotes a great response like a great counter to um the Ezreal I think it's really good in this draft for
38:51
Noam red force a lot of power with the Elise to let's see what the final ban is going to be um they might stick to some
38:59
of these AP junglers but I don't think you necessarily need to I think maybe getting rid of something that's just a
39:04
bit more standard could be an option here as they're taking their time air going to be taken away from vicka instead moving towards that mid lanane
39:10
so now an opportunity here I expect a jungle to be locked in keep that mid lane Top Lane as flexible as possible I
39:18
agree Wukong is a strong option here really punishing into the Elise and can
39:24
be quite strong into Sani as well so yeah the sh really strong it's not necessarily the peel for ad carry Wukong
39:31
that we've seen a lot of the time um where you keep that late game ad carry alive the front to back team fight kind
39:36
of gets protected but it does fit the theme of a little bit more aggressive play around this poppy where's the nil G
39:44
where is it he was the Neer guy remember um of course I we haven't seen that champion I don't even know whether it
39:50
exists anymore uh in 2025 but there's the this one does yeah oh no no
39:58
oh God I mean I guess if you really have the perfect scenario you could set up a
40:03
a feather call um the blade call with the Cocoon and stuff you know there's like some Synergy maybe yeah and and it
40:10
was also Zer Elise and Zer Elise doesn't feel very good so maybe that's a thing
40:15
so we're going to lock in the Aurora um still flexing actually uh you saw Fisher having a bit of a giggle and that means
40:22
that uh yeah maybe they're not even entirely sure who's going to be playing what just yet I think I think you could
40:27
play Gallo here actually uh it's not a lot of damage but it it gives you a really nice response to the Aurora and
40:34
you can match the Aurora no matter where she goes in that flexibility uh Victor I like a little bit less there's a lot
40:41
more magic damage via is not the type of player I associate with control Mages
40:46
and slow controlled gameplay and just kind of being a front to back AP carry
40:52
type player uh he has done it in the past but it's not really been what he's known for he's more similar to closer um
40:57
who he replaced on this roster uh who plays a lot of melees plays a lot more explosive picks but at the end of the
41:03
day I look at these drafts here I don't think either team ended up with a draft
41:08
that is super strong in its own isolation but I like what bnk put
41:13
together here and how it's going to set up team fights the poppy could be quite strong could be very powerful in the early game can help control objectives
41:20
and when you get to these messy team fights with these two teams that just aren't known for clean team fighting I do feel like B and K can counter some of
41:27
shim's craziness that they like to pull off you know you pull out the Elise it's leens I get it you know but maybe he
41:33
gets punished a few times I feel like there's a lot more opportunity when things get a little bit messy on the bnk
41:38
side if I look at either draft though like I said moments ago uh I don't feel like either of these drafts are even a
41:45
tier necessarily it's a very much these players are playing what they want to play not what the meta dictates is
41:50
necessarily the best type of draft we could have had here yeah there is some salvaging to to be done here and as I
41:55
think more about it I think the zeri would have been almost grief into the into the poppy because we've seen
42:01
poppies just snatch Zer away from Victory so so many times our best ones
42:06
of course have been able to win games but the zire certainly escapes that heroic charge uh problem a little bit
42:12
more effectively and there's a lot of Zone control against this composition which doesn't have a whole lot of range
42:17
outside of Victor and Jace being able to get some poke in an interesting one on both sides jump into it
42:24
[Music]
42:34
all right here we go ladies and gentlemen two Arcane characters and Mega Man on the side of uh bfx is very
42:41
exciting and so we'll see how that top side is going to go with you know space Vin and Poppy yeah it's pretty cool if
42:50
it was something like Caitlin at least here in the top side you know I feel pretty rough for Clear if he ended up in
42:56
that matchup but they are going to match the swap they have a ward as well they haven't seen the Elise just yet
43:02
obviously but they can reasonably assume um especially because they didn't see a big group up on the top side that any
43:08
information is being hidden lens is going to go sweep to you know say oh okay they don't know for sure but they
43:13
also don't know that yeah it's just Dia and Kell on the other side and I um I can't remember the match the the
43:20
interaction but I'm pretty sure steadfast presence blocks elise's spider for cube I actually don't know that but
43:26
I feel like it should yeah cuz it's like a mini Dash forward as uh clear is doing that I'm a top laner thing I I want
43:33
level two so I don't die immediately as I go to Lane and uh we've seen this every single day thus far I like to
43:40
think of that spider move is like a bite and not a dash but it it does Propel you
43:46
forward like a dash I just don't know how it's coded you do lunge a little bit Yeah but uh it's just been uh it's been
43:52
a while since I've seen the matchup so uh maybe our scholar on the desk will be
43:57
able to let us know we might see it right before our eyes as well uh in this Lane at some point they are standing
44:03
next to each other you do have a point see what Kell's going to be able to get done on this poppy has had some good poppy games in the past but sometimes
44:11
when he's on proactive Champions like this he can freeze not necessarily uh have those proactive plays on lock but
44:18
we'll see how he does go Nim do get the wave pushed up and at least they do have a lot of control here in this early
44:24
stage of the game as even the Poke is landing pretty nice as throws out a few of these cues we will have a bit of a
44:31
microscope on in this series because as highlighted earlier on he's the one that
44:36
needs to be stepping up for nongshim they're going to make some waves moving further into this tournament and into
44:42
the lck I think in this draft too it's quite challenging to get a ton of value
44:47
out of Zia you know great into the kaisa of course but into Victor you're going to be you know you're not going to be
44:54
able to outrange him or anything like that and he's going to be layering a lot of damage and you have to deal with Wukong Cyclone which you can't really
45:00
ult because he will just persist in his cyclone and knock you up anyways so you can buy some time you can buy some space
45:06
but it isn't always going to be guaranteed safety against this jungler so uh he has a tall order to uh to kind
45:13
of play this one out properly as you see Jace is on a big win streak here notice is played by a lot of uh strong players
45:21
as well including Morgan yeah it's certainly been the big winning Pick especially this tank Jace
45:27
as was piloted expertly by Doran uh yesterday Doran makes me believe in tank
45:33
Jace like actually at first I was like this is stupid this doesn't make any sense and I watch Dorne play I'm like oh my God it's broken Dorne is like he is
45:41
bringing back these low Eon top lanes and making them look successful it's
45:46
like it's been sort of a thing that's happened so so many times we haven't had the expert you know we haven't had the
45:53
qve right the QV has been gone for too long and Doren is now that guy
45:59
especially on okay that's just First Blood Kell's dead well there was the interaction wol I also said that there's
46:06
a chance you could set up the feathers with that and uh you know she was like challenge accepted um big damage onto
46:13
the poppy just isn't that tanky at this stage and uh down goes Kell so big win
46:20
there in the 2v2 and at least is always going to be strong into melee supports you know we've seen it into specifically
46:25
Leona a lot just Crush ring it because if you're melee and you get caught by the Cocoon and then you're rooted and
46:31
yeah bit late on the steadfast presence but uh not much really that could have done there and that is that so first
46:38
Blood going over uh to the Elise in fact in this case and we have to remember as well that lens is the most experienced
46:45
uh support elas player we have in the lck and he probably is in the world he's been playing it before it was cool um
46:51
that was what he was known for coming into the lck on Griffin in 2018 was
46:56
playing singed and playing El leise in every role um but mainly support uh so
47:03
back then it was weird and now it's just normal um and so lens's just kind of
47:08
getting patched in a little bit here which is to his benefit of course did debut the pick here in the lck um but
47:15
now it's been played by absolutely everyone and I think Carri has probably had the most impressive games on it thus
47:20
far but uh that little gank there in the 2v2 very very nice as far as a start to this game and you could have opted in
47:26
into playing Jace hold up okay uh he's doing it again yeah Kell is going to
47:32
take a lot of damage Dia as well as je is just going to chase him down the ghost has been used doesn't have the
47:37
blade caller but they just got back yeah well this is a disaster now it was oh
47:42
God lens is just not letting them go home as there's the flash lens might have bit off more than he can chew still
47:49
burning down but Gan over here Raptor also turning up but not actually able to affect the play slen is going to get
47:55
scared off you moving on on over now as Gideon a lot of Health available but they don't have control a cocoon is up
48:01
and it lands onto the monkey repel out immediately is Kell cannot find it but
48:06
they eventually will get that spider because what goes up must come down and gu is just going to dive on top of dible
48:13
there it is flashes into the brush but there is Vision there already and Nong
48:18
shim are all over this early game yeah I could see the thought process behind what bnk were trying to do there they
48:24
had Raptor coming up but you know even in a good isolated match of the Sani it's tough when you're not level six as
48:31
a Wukong to make big impactful plays there they already had the Health Advantage from that previous trade the catch on to lens was one thing right
48:37
okay he overextends you go there but then committing further in was a bit of a problem unfortunately I think Raptor
48:43
felt priced in cuz he made the big rotation over but they end up losing out on the 3v3 in a big way and this time
48:48
the kaisa picks up an additional kill last time around it was just lens who got that one so or sorry the the uh Zia
48:55
excuse me picks up a kill and and so you've got an ad carry who's accelerated now in a matchup that you were already
49:00
kind of crushing and do naturally Crush so things are looking not so good here
49:05
for bnk in this early game watch this again diao is super low so is lens right but he's a support in this case he's
49:11
going to be the one to set the engage because he has repel he can avoid so much damage in this interim so yes he
49:16
does ultimately die but he buys a ton of time and then Diablo kind of panics here as well flashing into this brush he's
49:22
not going to change that one even if there isn't a word there cuz they'll just walk in and see him but but I think just hoping maybe he could turn
49:28
something around and I don't even know whether it was necessary but it was a very sexy flash over the void Seeker as
49:33
well uh from J to make sure that he is definitely not dying in that exchange yeah maybe if he gets hit by that and
49:40
then he flash in the brush and there's no Ward maybe there's a chance maybe like if the plasma gets proed obviously
49:46
Dia's going to be doing a whole lot more so making sure that doesn't happen but I don't know whether that was all that close in that uh scenario but
49:53
hindsight's 2020 was very well played here by J and the best thing is is that he's showing that Killer Instinct and
50:00
that is precisely what we were asking for at the beginning of this game you love it when a plan comes together as
50:05
kingan dashing around not going to be bothered by this steadfast presence as Kellen will be able to clear out that Ward and now Raptor able to slink in
50:12
unbeknownst it's tough to dive this Essa with flash and all oh but Gideon's coming in oh no the Wukong gets trapped
50:19
in the prison but kingan still likely to go down the public execution is unfortunately not going to get seen by
50:25
anyone and BN K they get out of the woods but that was very funny at the
50:30
beginning of that fight I feel like that still wasn't like the right move from bnk but they got lucky okay King is a
50:35
little bit too far away from the turret fer is going to be fine here we'll get out no problem now raptor is going to be able to looks like take this blue buff
50:42
away although yeah ulti comes on through as another dive and another death as the repel gets him out of there fish are
50:48
going to be flashing that's the right flash however not going to be good enough as Vick going to secure it with a
50:54
chaos storm probably would have been good for that that want to go over to Diablo but I think that via certainly in
50:59
a position to carry now as well yeah if he had teleport too maybe he could come over here and clear up some of these minions and stop this push but it's
51:05
going to be a lot of plate gold going over so this game is is kind of off the rails already here you mentioned bnk
51:12
having a lot of opportunities of this draft in chaos I think they were gifted that kill on to kingan and obviously
51:18
with the extended fight there via picks up one as well but they left clear isolated in that bottom Lane he didn't
51:24
want to Lane into the El knew it would get Dove but after they got Tempo top side they could then Focus him down on
51:30
the bottom side and so he gets pushed out there tons of plates go over so their Lane swap where they've matched
51:36
the lane swap basically uh where they also swapped I guess I should say still ends up leaving clear out to dry here
51:42
because of that topside exchange he gets cocooned he gets bur down I me Le just does so much damage and she's so good in
51:47
this meta because she can avoid a lot of that turret ramp with her repel over here Raptor looks like oh he's
51:53
overextended but he actually still is in position to help up here and with the longrange Killer Instinct with just
51:59
enough Mana Dia is able to help VI get that kill I thought for sure the kill would go to diao I think Dia possibly
52:05
could have even got it with the Q um but Vick didn't want to risk it gu also probably via wanted the money um and he
52:11
does manage to get it there so things are just uh not done I've seen this
52:17
movie before as kingan not going to find the ulti once again but this time he's not dead dashing around will be able to
52:23
grab himself a shield as he makes his Way South wood but raptor is going to be there the Smite comes in good Flash and
52:31
king that's some fancy footwork yeah all D finishes off the turret bottom side
52:38
had a rotation over from clear to Mid Raptors not Raptors the uh grubs are up in 10 seconds here so he he felt like
52:44
okay we got to make something happen here top side I need to rotate over but it leaves the turret open and now they not a position to actually start these
52:51
Raptors up because kingan survived this gives time for rotation to happen so everybody's up here set up for this
52:57
Raptor contest for Nim and Raptor sorry I keep calling it Raptors cuz Raptors is in the game raptor is in the game but
53:03
the grub contest uh comes over from Nim and Raptor will just have to leave he is Wukong he doesn't have to flash or
53:08
anything like that but they get nothing on the map oh man and this is also six grubs going over to an ambessa
53:13
composition um not to mention that you know Aurora actually does decently well in the S Side Lane with you know how
53:19
kind of elusive she can be so Nong shim certainly benefiting a whole lot also
53:25
that is going to be Feats of Strength now secured for them uh at the same time as they were able to grab that turret on
53:30
the bottom side of the map upgraded shoes all that good stuff as Kell I don't know whether he's allowed to walk
53:36
up here clear and Raptor are making their way in but in this 3v3 it's going to be tough with a fourth though maybe
53:42
an opportunity no blade caller here for jiu as he's now looking to get himself out great cocoon from lens who does have
53:48
to flash gets but does get himself out of there dible also going to be our Killer Instinct in in order to make his
53:55
way out an awkward verb knock not going to lie as uh Gideon is going to be on
54:00
this Ward I feel like we've been waiting for some replays for a while but we can't get to them because there's just
54:05
action all over the place and Kell is also just going to get prisoned and now
54:10
he's in trouble the Cocoon Point Blank Range onto Raptor as he throws down the
54:16
Cyclone but Lans is going to find him still the second Cyclone's going to take out the elite keeping verdict says no to
54:23
Fisher and Raptor even survives a couple of feathers yeah you know I actually still will defend almost to the death
54:30
like Len's choice to actually cocoon Raptor there because he had pable it actually seemed like a super sick
54:36
instant decision by him where he's like okay we kill both of them this way and this is the safest possible uh thing to do cuz your instinct is always going to
54:43
tell you like oh kill low Health Target let's let's cocoon Kell there we guarantee the kill but maybe he gets interrupted by the cyclone and then Kell
54:49
gets away just barely and then you know obviously Raptor has the advantage in the fight but because he doesn't kill Kell the ult goes off and raptor is able
54:57
to just narrowly survive there so lens sacrifices himself unintentionally uh in
55:02
this exchange this game has just been so wild obviously like this is the most recent replay Gideon catches Kellen and
55:09
then look at the Cocoon swamp here onto Raptor but he still gets the Cyclone off and can Flash over the wall and then
55:14
lens goes to chase him but gets hit by the second part of the cyclone and then Kell has a steadfast or not the steadfast the uh keep verdict to knock
55:22
the Aurora away so Fisher can't clean up the fight it was actually really well played there by but I also feel like the
55:27
still had the right idea defend him there and the execute was so close to just killing him right like uh it like
55:33
it says it's an execute it should have executed wasn't able to do quite enough damage and uh so lens looked a little
55:39
bit silly in the end but this is what you going to have to do right like we've seen uh so many of our eles just play
55:45
fast and loose because you kind of have to that's uh how the champion works in the support role your base damages are
55:51
quite High uh as Aon going to connect here as lens once again demonstrating
55:56
exactly what we were talking about it's uh it's fun to play a leas in situations like this because yeah you'll never One
56:02
V one kill VI in this situation but as a support with low Eco you know you're like well I can actually take a ton of
56:08
his health away um Alona can't do that so I'm going to take every chance I can get on a proc electrocute every moment I
56:14
can he has zazo in this game as well so that all that extra damage coming through and maybe that actually gives
56:19
him just an extra Edge Fisher that is in this sign Lane to maybe get something done just looking for these angles
56:25
constantly that's why we seen such high death games on Elise where the Elise still wins because she's often
56:32
sacrificing herself for the greater team fight yeah and uh an interesting thing has occurred here as well DIA has gone
56:38
yal first which is something I haven't seen just yet seen a fair bit of Kraken Slayer if they want a bit more physical
56:44
damage but yal is a new one has been buffed on this patches now Fisher looking to try and survive here that is
56:50
a nanian ultimate from Gideon and a very dead Fisher but still Poppy's going to be on the floor so one for one not too
56:57
bad there for Nim as they are pushing in this mid lane at the same time D not going to let diao get in there without a
57:02
fight but it is going to be that midwave cleared out and kingan is just continuing to split push eclipse is now
57:09
done see what he's going to be able to purchase for himself as he does go home only a wave ahead of his Jace
57:14
counterpart in clear yeah I think that you know there's no plates anymore obviously and they're not going to be able to get this mid turret so a trade
57:22
up here for bnk because Victor picks up that second kill versus you know support grabbing a kill on the other side or
57:28
kill onto the support on the other side by the Sani and you know the the the time in which you get with that turret
57:34
in the bottom side you know King's going to have on the ambessa that sort of stuff matters uh way less when you're
57:39
not actually killing the turret you see on the mini map he stops channeling his back he's like okay that's kind of a disaster over there but I'm going to
57:45
keep pushing but he still gives all of that farm to clear because there is no turret there clear can actually go get
57:50
all of that so know it's it's still a gold lead here for noin but small little edges that b andk have across the board
57:57
remember that a lot of that gold on a Sani versus a Victor the Victor's gold is going to be way more valuable yeah
58:02
very true and I think BK furx might be able to get themselves a Herald because
58:09
they have so much Vision towards his top side however it is now just getting cleared out and um Nong shim are just
58:15
going to walk up and start it so often times you'll see teams do a lot of work
58:20
when it comes to setup uh as Kellen is going to prove that you do in fact block the spider Q by pressing W that is going
58:28
to work out very well to avoid him taking too much damage there although it doesn't do a whole lot to a high Health Target is now Raptor looking for a wrap
58:35
around wants to stop kingan from being able to get in here but the public execution is a real dangerous one Raptor
58:40
just walks in and hits a highway robbery kingan can you find an angle as kingan's just going to move him out of there but
58:45
uh he's going to be dying Raptor now going to get imprisoned and he is the
58:51
one that Drew the Short Straw as he doesn't get over the wall there not quite an option so the rest of bnk going
58:57
to look to try and push this midwave out lick their wounds a little bit and say at least we got the rift Herald even if
59:03
they weren't able to pick up the eye yeah and I mean there's three outer turrets Still Standing where it's going
59:08
to be uh potentially useful and uh watch this one more time Raptor comes over
59:15
here use Warrior tricker just to steal it Gideon actually gets blocked by Kell a lot of resources being put into this
59:21
Poppy and consistently fight is a little bit scary I think if B and K were actually better set up for this fight
59:26
it would have been way better for them Unfortunately they didn't have any PRI so even though a lot of that damage and resource were put into Kell they end up
59:34
winning the fight swimmingly but don't end up stopping the Smite from going over his Kell yeah lens going to just
59:40
say all right well if this is the the situation I will try and offer some damage back kingan moves up they're not able to actually kill the pesky spider
59:47
as oh L that was so cute going to stop him from being able to take him down by
59:52
blast coning him away and now the permafrost comes in Kellen just going to get wrath by the winter and will be
59:58
taken down where he stands this poppy not necessarily working out for b k thus
1:00:04
far but that was very sad for Kell yeah really nice move there by lens to kind
1:00:09
of just isolate him there blast cone him into Oblivion is it crazy but I think that lens is pom so far I think so he's
1:00:17
my front runner I know it's a 303 zyus public execution onto vicka he's going
1:00:22
to have to flash but that's not going to get him away from this ambessa Raptor chasing him down clear is going to very
1:00:28
awkwardly teleport in but will be able to grab a kill on to this ambessa repel
1:00:34
gets lens out of there and dible now just standing awkwardly behind the turret uh raptor is going to move in and the Cocoon is going to miss and that
1:00:41
will mean that dible takes down the spider b k they managed to grab that one is now Kell's dead again J going to
1:00:47
collect another kill and he's continuing to push here in this mid lane they have six grubs so I mean the push of the Z is
1:00:53
actually relevant plus fiser here in the top side really working on this turret it's a lot of relevant damage being done
1:00:59
even though it's a trade up in kills in that play bottom side so no really just trying to brute force their way into
1:01:05
these macro trades which I think ultimately can work out for them especially because the Zia now has four kills and we're looking at like Victor
1:01:12
versus Z in this game it's a low econ Aurora so far we've seen so many big errors made in this game by B and K
1:01:19
where otherwise fights could have been a lot cleaner at least in this situation they do have the teleport so you do see the gang come through or I don't even
1:01:25
want to call it gank but the response come through here from clear to help bail them out he picks up a ton of gold diao can fall up from long range and
1:01:31
unfortunately one of elise's strengths is not being tanky another one is not really defending turret Dives all too
1:01:37
well cuz she only has one cocoon button and way lens doesn't actually uh count
1:01:42
that kakun as a Miss cuz he still got the cleanse yeah regardless of whether it went completely the wrong direction
1:01:47
or not uh so count it sorry ladies and gentlemen if you wanted to Flame lens for that one you cannot he got the
1:01:54
summon he still is definitely leading P for me um we're not done just yet and
1:01:59
there I mean I feel like a lot of the time with how is this how is this still voracious yeah well it's it's calculated
1:02:05
at 14 minutes right so yeah I guess at least unless they hadn't changed that um
1:02:11
assuming they haven't changed that which I don't think it was in the notes there were a lot of things that Aon changed but weren't in the notes let's just say
1:02:16
I don't really know exactly what they changed to make it better is Kellen Ken really needs to press dead presence a
1:02:22
bit FAS to this yeah he's a little bit slow on it today but I I feel like a lot of these fights for no have been like
1:02:27
one step forward and then one step back it's not two steps back but I'm like hey maybe a little bit cleaner and you guys
1:02:32
have a bigger lead uh a lot of the lead is in those turrets that they have with the six scrubs they picked up you know that's pretty huge for them and now
1:02:39
they're just going to start oton here because there's no pry here for bfx whatsoever no one's even nearby and how
1:02:44
do you face check like face checking an Elise is so frustrating they're going to put down this control W that's going to
1:02:51
try and get them in there as this is going down very low can Raptor get the steel that's the question because you
1:02:56
cannot fight them after they get this buff keeper verdict comes down but it's too late the Cocoon is going to block
1:03:01
hel in there as well as a public execution oh no insult meat injury as
1:03:07
bnk not only lose Aon but they also lose both their jungle and support and Nong
1:03:13
shim are going to be able to continue pushing with an inability to die yeah no this is that that is probably the the
1:03:19
straw that breaks the camels back here for being and this camel was already walking with rickety knees wolf I you
1:03:26
know I thought maybe we could see in a fair fight B and K stand up to noin but it's just not going to happen anymore
1:03:32
and the funny part about it is both of the solo laners were just not involved in that exchange at all like clear went
1:03:37
for a hex gate uh flank on this Jace tank Jace he's like maybe I can get it
1:03:42
done you can see vickle on the mini map when you'll be able to look at if we have a replay he's like I got teleport but I'm that's a zero sum game I'm not
1:03:49
going in there you could see him like walk towards he's like nah I'm I'm not showing up to this one I'm sorry you
1:03:54
guys I'm not going to oh man nothing's going right this means J might die as
1:04:00
okay CLE does get the control Ward down that means the Cocoon is not going to spell his death and so we already knew
1:04:07
there's no vision stuff like that look at Via on the mini map oh that cocoon man like he's like he's walking up and
1:04:13
he's like nah I'm not going I'm not going and Jace also you can see clear is
1:04:19
like I'm flanking and he's like actually no I'm uh I'm not I'm not joining uh I'm I'm going to work on this mid turret so
1:04:25
so uh it was just not a fair fight they just didn't have Vision it was a good read from Nim knowing how much control they had over the map how many turrets
1:04:32
they've taken off and now you know at first it was just gold only they had from the turrets but the extra control that gives them on the map is is immense
1:04:38
and now that they have the oton buff on top of it they can rip the last few of them away and they're going to push hard
1:04:44
here into the bottom Lane and look for potentially a dive on the clear yep clear is going to take a bunch of damage here from King and shields up most of it
1:04:51
and will continue to try and get some pressure down as there's the public execution clear here manages to go to
1:04:56
the skies and speaking of to the skies keep his verdict sends away the ambessa but they're continuing to fight here oh
1:05:02
chiu that's that Killer Instinct we wanted to see two kills ripped away from
1:05:08
bnk and then he just withdraws goes back home as Fisher now it's his turn to pop
1:05:13
off underneath the inhibitor turret and now it's just via left standing that is sakon value if ever I've seen it it
1:05:21
certainly is uh they don't get the inhibitor turret nor the inhibitor but
1:05:26
they did get a lot of gold and now they're even further ahead in gold and uh so I think that was a pretty
1:05:31
efficient usage of the autocon buff it was if it was previous patch you'd feel even better about it but still I think
1:05:37
well worth it getting this kill uh rather getting this turret and then getting several kills here with a really nice engage yeah there's a keeper
1:05:44
verdict that knocks the ambessa away but kind of really helps uh kingan out in this case actually since he was in the
1:05:50
dangerous spot anyways and then um yeah that is that is so satisfying watching
1:05:55
to make that decision and then fer here too he's like no one's getting out alive including me but uh little bit of a
1:06:03
overextension there you could say like this is one I think the space will be a little bit less enthusiastic about but everything up until that was pretty
1:06:09
great well uh lens has found vicka and there's another cocoon God this guy is
1:06:14
very good at support at lease it's like he's been playing it for like 11 years um as n shim continuing to push forward
1:06:22
lens as well like in a lead yeah finds that one with that Ward over the wall
1:06:28
and dible takes 50% of his health bar there goes the inhibitor turret and Nim I mean their wallets are so incredibly
1:06:33
huge they are just kind of dropping it on them now uh but still they're doing it with style I mean he's got storm
1:06:39
surge and an armu and a needlessly large Rod he has so much money he's basically a mid laner yeah yeah it's it's actually
1:06:46
insane like and this is I talked about it earlier how as a support you have you get to have that impact you get to have
1:06:51
fun you get to hurt people um on this Champion but when you're this fed you really hurt well they're looking to try
1:06:57
and kill kingan here Kellen will die if he tries to Coral him any more than this uh and you can see kingan realized that
1:07:04
public execution going to go down let's see whether the world champ can make his way out and ladies and gentlemen that is the World Champ difference white right
1:07:10
there doesn't have to be just wolf click that has it as now Nim push in the mid lane they're going to take another
1:07:17
inhibitor and this game is basically over wolf yeah I think it has been for a
1:07:22
little while but it felt like maybe when they were like 3,000 gold behind like oh there's a team fight that could happen
1:07:27
if they get to fight on even terms but no just never let them have that fight they've never given them any space any
1:07:33
vision and as you can see here I mean once again B and K are completely blind trying to kind of Lea Frog their way
1:07:40
closer to the baron this is going to give Nim a free reset here they have hex Gates they get over very quickly and
1:07:47
this is just via trying to farm could have waited for the minions to come to him but he lost some gold he was very
1:07:52
greedy here and he is punished by the spider well hen is Spider-Man Actually
1:07:57
he actually is it is very true uh Elise is spider lady and he is therefore
1:08:02
Spider-Man uh yes I think that's Cannon uh so vicka is just going to try and repair this bottom Lane that's not
1:08:08
really going to work Nim have a free Baron if they would like to get it Gideon also winning a 1 V one against
1:08:13
the Wukong is a sign of poor things to come espe I mean this uh this sichani is
1:08:19
so big wolf we were talking about the fact that like he's getting a bunch of money early and how that's not a good thing I'm kind of feeling like maybe it
1:08:25
is is the first cocoon is going to miss there and that might spell the end of lens he repels raptor is burning and
1:08:31
Elise just flashes away L just he just walks he's got those tap Dan and shoes
1:08:37
on and he's feeling good about it as J throws out the feather storm that stops the elbow from killing him for a while
1:08:43
does mean that he does go down but B K I don't think they're winning this one public execution just for fun but King
1:08:49
and gets that Shield stays alive and Gideon is never going to die again this game his health bar is too big and
1:08:55
Fisher is done stopped a baron that's the good news hey nailed it there you go the bad news is you did not stop a six
1:09:02
scrub Aurora from wiping out majority of this Nexus turret you see kingan's got
1:09:08
the teleport in as well and they are looking to end this one right here right now yeah that is uh game one in the
1:09:15
books here for Nong shim probably the most cathartic game for any Nong shim
1:09:20
fan if you are a noodle boys Enthusiast this is a good sign for things to come
1:09:25
because this is jiu looking back on form this is fer finding some angles Gideon
1:09:31
looking really really good man this is the nction we were promised this is the nction with the upgrades that we saw on
1:09:38
paper in kingan and in Len's being insane this is what we were expecting and finally we get to see it even though
1:09:45
I think they definitely could have shown a little bit more restraint at times their aggressive approach to getting the
1:09:51
top side control to getting the uh Z into that lane with the Elise into the
1:09:56
Jace grabbing that turret grabbing basically both of those outers super early and pressuring mid constantly gave
1:10:02
them so much pry on objectives and they played a really good macro game through that snowball and made it very difficult
1:10:09
for the Victor that had money through some of those kind of wonky exchanges like where he's looking to fight VI like
1:10:14
I'm actually kind of accelerated maybe we can fight maybe in a longer fight with a good Wukong setup I can do the damage we have the kaisa we have that
1:10:20
Mobility but they just never got to set up those fights cuz they couldn't see and then Kell kept getting picked because he had to face check and there's
1:10:26
an elisee there and then you can't Side Lane into this anymore the ambassa threat is always a big problem and I
1:10:32
said I thought bnk might Excel because of the chaos of this game it didn't really come to pass what the heck Gideon
1:10:40
top damage well a little bit behind vicka but otherwise yes on his team on his team yeah that's absolutely insane
1:10:47
I'm just I'm so impressed this hot steel Sani situation that is that is out of
1:10:52
control so vickle yeah got a lot of damage on his side but it wasn't able to win out the game a fun first one though
1:10:58
in this best of three we'll see whether bnk FX can make it interesting and take away game number two we're going to go
1:11:04
to a short break then Deon and the boys have the space and we'll be there for game number two see you soon

1:17:37
hello everyone and welcome to the space for the final day of the lck cup group
1:17:43
stage I am just normal degon here also known as Daniel and joined by our two
1:17:50
fantastic analysts it is the Dan analyst and Val analyst welcome
1:17:57
gentlemen he's the danst and he's the v v danst that's CU my name is Valdez get
1:18:04
it and that is Daniel Ox Harrison Val danst and danst uh we are that's a good
1:18:10
point the superlative for most analysts that is about to happen right now we're
1:18:16
about to analyze everything with our brains and our names that's a good point so just
1:18:22
remember to set the stakes from this last match it is bnk furx needing a victory to make it on into the playin
1:18:31
stage and Nong shim will save uh the DN Automotive freaks with the victory there
1:18:37
they are up 1 Z in that last one let's take a look at the draft and here we go it's time to analyze
1:18:43
everyone yes put our analyst caps on I can only do that cuz I'm analyst today
1:18:48
cap um I really dislike this poppy pickup here um maybe there was intent to
1:18:55
flex it maybe there was maybe there wasn't but they end up putting the support into the Elise just a terrible
1:19:01
time like Elise is has long has longrange cocoons you can stun without really getting up close to the poppy the
1:19:06
poppy completely flopped you're not really disrupting the engage coming out from the elas cuz you just you know beer full combos you without getting into
1:19:13
melee range doesn't have a dash you can really interrupt H and you don't have great setup for the Kaiser either it's
1:19:19
it's so conditional like if someone's against a wall then you can slam them into it but you're not doing with like a naus or a railwood so
1:19:25
I think it just made Lane really hard and this game kind of just exploded from bot Lane um you know we also saw the
1:19:31
Sani which we kind of missed yesterday just didn't see it really at all Gideon had a really strong performance uh you
1:19:36
know despite the fact Raptor was making things happen Gideon just kind of power farmed ahead end up doing most damage on
1:19:42
his team just cuz he was so fed with a hard steel so yeah a lot of things I I
1:19:47
think the the poppy really stood out to me as like being a weak point in the draft and then the game just kind of bled out through bot yeah for me if
1:19:54
Kellen was playing it really well and we were talking about uh champion pool issues as well with Kellen maybe he's
1:20:00
like okay this is one of the things that I can play and also kaisa poppy is something that is being played a lot
1:20:05
nowadays so we can make it work with a lot of practice but they were not able to like the Zia pick here though that
1:20:11
was actually pretty good from the side of Antion yeah some would say maybe that Poppy in the elase was a bad trade
1:20:17
something that they maybe can like think about for their first round pick next time let's take a look at the Highlight
1:20:23
number one here and it was Zia popping off early thanks to that first round
1:20:28
pick at least I mean he's got 100 zero to level three there's not anything you can do at least if you playing something like Leona you can press W and be a bit
1:20:34
tankier uh and then in this play A lot happened before this you know we saw Kaiser get chunked we saw Alise get
1:20:40
chunked but so much skirmishing power coming out here Gideon manages to take out the Wukong and then jiu playing this
1:20:46
one really well getting the kill on the Kaiser yeah the other part of this as well is that you know we've seen a lot
1:20:52
of support Elise it is kind of uh fan month pick right now A lot of people are playing it from support um lens is one
1:20:59
of the guys that actually is extremely well practiced on it and I think he did a fantastic job of showcasing that today
1:21:05
he hit every single cocoon basically he was always rep playing at the right time and he got his team especially is AD
1:21:11
carry very far ahead and the thing is cuz they went bot and they killed a Jace and got a bunch of plates there they got plates top like J got five plates he had
1:21:17
a 2,000 gold lead at 14 minutes uh you know you can see it in front of you when
1:21:23
this happens in the game it's just over it's so hard to come back from this when you're playing especially into a pick like Isaiah where you know there was
1:21:30
nothing that really outranges her and she has the safety that of her Al it just meant that like you're kind of an Unstoppable Force already at 40 minutes
1:21:37
into the game yeah made it very very difficult uh for him to play but it then led to our second highlight here at the
1:21:44
heral fight with that gold lead uh things just don't get any better for being K yeah so the thing about this is
1:21:50
is very desperate right they're behind already their ad carry as we mentioned just in a really rough spot and they
1:21:55
just try to force it the steel is fine you know if you're sending Wukong in that's fine but Kellen face checking the
1:22:01
brush straight into Elise dies again it's just free and yeah they got the rift T but they're not able to pick up
1:22:07
the eye and the the fight itself is just such a disaster that we had to get this highlight because this was the end of
1:22:13
the game this Rift tur TI uh fight was where actually nongshim just put the nail on the cough yeah and I mean you
1:22:19
have such a strong front line with the fact that you have this Sani so tanky level up on Wukong just from the power
1:22:24
fing and then you have Z just doing a million damage so you know I I think there's a lot of things that kind of
1:22:30
went wrong in this game but I think really you need to think about how your Bot Lane is going to interact picking
1:22:36
poppy that early in the draft when the at least is able to be count uh come in as a counter it's just it's never going to workn yeah but however bnk FX have
1:22:44
yet to have won on the red side good thing for them they move over to the blue side what do you thinking priority
1:22:49
wise in terms of the draft here Dan alist I mean honestly I just think inure you have a better bot Lane match up you
1:22:54
know uh Kellen is a player who's had some champion pool issues in the past but we know he's obviously lent on stuff like rard before just you have to really
1:23:01
think about how we going to interact in the 2v2 and if you end up in a situation where the 2v2 is rough you really need to work hard to avoid matching into that
1:23:08
whether it's by Lane stops but you know I I I think especially to a player like lens it's kind of a complete opposite
1:23:14
where Kellen was you know very proficient on a small pool and lens has such a wide pool he can work on all
1:23:21
right well there you have it we'll see what bnk FX will be able to do for their next game to get into the next game
1:23:27
let's send it back on over to our casters ATL and wolf thank you very much D valden
1:23:35
analist that was absolutely fantastic I for one very much enjoyed the name tags
1:23:41
was very very cool um one thing that I didn't think got mentioned enough was
1:23:46
the sichani damage I wanted to know how and why he was doing all of it hard
1:23:51
steel uh was a big part of it I think but but yeah he just and also I guess winning he was he was winning and like
1:23:59
he just constantly he was never the focal point right no one was shooting at him cuz they needed to kill the real PRI targets but they couldn't and so all the
1:24:06
while he just kept hitting people over and over and over again it was a lot of hitting people yeah he had a lot of
1:24:11
aggressive fights in the early game too which stacked up sani's damage uh more than she would normally have in the early game cuz she was constantly
1:24:17
involved in a lot of those tussles top side one thing I think we could say pretty comfortably about that last uh
1:24:23
game was there was not really a great Lane to be in especially with Kellen playing aggressively and kind of walking
1:24:28
into lens's cocoon range you were never going to win that one you wanted to make sure that Jace wasn't going to get completely blasted but then after you
1:24:35
lost top side he got blasted anyways we need to see a better Lane setup here in general for bnk going into the second
1:24:40
draft they have blue side and we'll see what Kell wants to go to cuz it's been mentioned a lot but he was definitely
1:24:45
the weak Link in that first game yep it's not been the first time for this guy as well he certainly needs to catch
1:24:50
a break here in the lck cup we'll see whether this game number two is going to do it for them blue side and game two
1:24:56
two very good signs um because it has been this this situation is 100% of
1:25:02
their wins they've managed to do it three times thus far against teams that have been pretty good uh here in the
1:25:07
Elsa cup so this is their chance this is their opportunity and I expect this to go to three games let check out this
1:25:14
draft to see how it is going to happen as yon and Rumble both taken away from fiser and kingan certainly two of their
1:25:20
best performing Champions as the obligatory bands come in from no kalista's still there obviously Ash varis is still um both of those
1:25:27
Champions are still available they weren't played in game one so priority may change towards ad carries here on
1:25:33
blue side for this one as looking at another ban here see what they do lock
1:25:38
away the rumble is gone already Cante could be the angle here they're fishing for with that Rumble ban and the Nar ban
1:25:45
it's like clear's like ban Cante or we will first pick it and as a result noore
1:25:51
probably ban it then they'll get their pick of either the ash or vars if that's the angle they want to go for problem with that is the other one is is open on
1:25:57
the other side so varus will be the preferable pick for Dia in this case if the gante band comes through which it
1:26:02
does so my expectation is that's where we're headed here with this first pick VI however also available yeah VI and
1:26:10
Zyra are the two Champions that snuck through the uh ban phase based on what nongshim took away on blue side last
1:26:16
time so this does make a fair bit of sense uh the Zyra band is just because Raptor has been gravitating to it uh in
1:26:22
uh you know previous meta and has been very very good at the champion Gideon not really too phased
1:26:27
though they're just going to install loock the Zin and there is the Ezreal as well keeping the color coordination you
1:26:33
like to see it I think you really need to grab either the ash R varus here as bnk to the ash can follow up on the V
1:26:40
ult really well varus is great into Ezreal so you can kind of win the the mid matchup when they move out of lane
1:26:46
and then Farm in mid and you know you can also crush a top laner with the varus as well or Ash so either of those
1:26:51
feel like a really strong point you can grab in this trap the azir is solid here too has some great Synergy with the vi
1:26:58
very strong mid jungle Duo but I really I I don't want to see another Kellen lock in here the poppy was a little bit
1:27:04
early was a little bit out of place last time around and I think giving diao the power in this part of the draft before
1:27:09
they lose any ability to crush that Ezreal is definitely a big angle to take here on blue side yeah um could be just
1:27:17
a varis luck in but uh instead then considering for a blind ja yeah I'm a
1:27:23
bit worried about that one as well and I was thinking already that the air looks reactionary right like it looks like uh
1:27:29
we can see the zenzo Ezreal composition we've seen this with AIA so many times
1:27:34
let's take it away from them so that they cannot add that to the comp but then you miss out on that incredible
1:27:40
Synergy that you can get from a tiia from an Ahi from a LeBlanc from so many of these Champions that can pair
1:27:47
alongside the single Target lock down of a so much as fer just Cycles through a bunch of stuff and then locks in a
1:27:53
gargoyle that's going to feel absolutely fine alongside the aeran lane and will then be able to augment the zinz out
1:27:59
going in over and over again the thing that's great about the Gallo as well not only is it flexible theoretically you
1:28:05
could play it on the top side of the map at the same time but it functions as a way to amplify kingan's ability to carry
1:28:12
and he has been carrying on this team it it's it's so true it really plays very
1:28:17
well into the AGG the gang blank exactly I was going to that was the next thing I was going to mention right onto your point but also facilitates uh keeping an
1:28:24
already safe backline alive against by azir and the Jack so the ezil is such a
1:28:30
great pick here and they're they're looking to potentially ban I think that that varis away in this situation and
1:28:37
see if they end up locking that one away they already took away the rata which can be problematic into this type of draft going for the Zer instead
1:28:44
interesting Zer does follow up on that type of aggression very well very much Dia very much A dia Champion as well uh
1:28:52
especially playing it in uh like a lot in Challenger that was sort of one of his things so just taking away Comfort I
1:28:59
guess on both counts they got rid of the the rumble already the Nar is gone gante is banned so you know you're feeling
1:29:05
pretty comfortable about your setup for the Jacks right now regardless of what king is playing the GP is gone so that
1:29:11
part is good but you know will you be able to get the same sort of control in the bottom lane or in the lane swap
1:29:18
against set top laner the varus kind of fits the bill for me in this situation I think Ash could be quite strong with the vi set they have too both are good but
1:29:25
based on the bands here it looks like they just don't think Diablo is going to do it and this is uh this deters that V
1:29:30
pick but also like look at this as far as a we're going to drop on top of you and murder you composition Misfortune is
1:29:38
exactly not what you want to be playing right now you want to be playing something with a thousand dashes
1:29:44
unfortunately there aren't very many of those left available and diao's still going to lock it in oh this is I mean
1:29:49
look okay there's the Shen lens is just he's he's just letting us know by the way I'm the Shen guy too I was expecting
1:29:57
Shen or uh Yumi because both of them can just drop down with the Galler yeah well
1:30:03
here's the thing so I if you look at BK's draft in isolation it's a pretty strong draft it's got a lot of engage
1:30:09
it's got easy kind of guaranteed fall of damage with Misfortune it's got late game scaling with the air it's got a lot
1:30:15
of great Parts here and you look at the other side you're like okay there's not as much late game damage the problem is that you know any single Target whether
1:30:22
it's the misfortune who's very vable not mobile and is you know stationary while channeling her and the azir who's pretty
1:30:29
squishy it's really easy for Camille to lock down the azir and then get Shen ulted and then get gallo ulted and it's
1:30:36
never going to be a surviving azir it's never going to be a surviving Misfortune but you can also just kind of focus on
1:30:42
the azir instead and go Misfortune isn't going to do that much long-term damage when we're going into cleanups in the
1:30:47
fight she's more of a bullet time Combo oriented champion in this draft with the real and I just feel like this time I
1:30:53
really really like Nim's chances I mean their drafting is not as standard meta
1:30:58
just like it wasn't really in game one but it's so specifically good into what bnk put together and bnk don't have hard
1:31:07
Lane pressure really anywhere the azer can get a small Edge the Jax is going to be fine but I was really hoping for
1:31:13
something to punish this ezal before it hits its two item Spike and I just don't think they have that I don't really see it either I think so much is on Raptor's
1:31:20
shoulders like this guy has to get around make this buy work in the early game otherwise the combo is going to be
1:31:26
scary let's get into
1:31:34
[Music] it all right lens gets to say trust me
1:31:40
I'm a doctor which is absolutely terrifying if you know anything about how leens plays the game and uh Kellen
1:31:47
he is going to learn as he does spot all of nim making their way over thankfully isn't going to move any further for but
1:31:54
information given over to Nim about the location of the bottom Lane and as I say bottom Lane they are in the bottom Lane
1:32:00
that does make you know no Lan swap just yet so outside of Korea we have a few of those like doctor dramas that are pretty
1:32:06
popular like house and and scrubs there's probably a few as well in Korea that was quite good
1:32:13
um Dr Foster but in Korea we have about like 72 uh medical dramas and I feel
1:32:19
like it's a huge opportunity for maybe a Shen medical drama maybe the second of Arcane will actually be just a Shen
1:32:25
medical drama Koreans will watch it man I promise you and it's not no not even the second season because you know how
1:32:31
they're doing like different like uh story lines and like going into all sorts of different things you just run it alongside yeah you know and you could
1:32:37
have kenon there as well there's a whole skin line right a Carie there um like the nurse's kie skin is is a real thing
1:32:44
oh man that's so cool there is a there's a medical drama that's ready to go they could add so many other Champions to the
1:32:50
skin line as well those SK so well I mean I'm just saying riot I mean we got to get this email yeah I talk about
1:32:57
writing emails all the time this one has to happen uh lens and this is not a whole lot of power in the lane um
1:33:04
necessarily but uh the Shadow Dash is very very strong if you can connect it
1:33:10
another thing I want to talk about in this draft cuz we've seen this matchup between uh the Jax and the Camille so
1:33:15
much and it's volatile in what it means for the game so often because whoever gets a huge lead has the S Side Lane
1:33:21
power and both these Champions are so incredibly powerful insides but even if for some reason
1:33:27
kingan ends up falling significantly behind in this game what he has is two Global Champions that can impact that s
1:33:33
lane so even if he's behind he has the ability to to be kind of amped Up by lens and fer in this composition so it's
1:33:39
hard for clear to really push that Advantage even if he gets a significant lead here so they even kind of have that
1:33:45
backup angle for the Camille if the Camille gets ahead it's a disaster cuz she has back up when she's killing that
1:33:51
lane and pushing even harder oh okay doesn't have Aftershock for a few seconds asen's just lying in wait level
1:33:59
two gained here by all of our bottom Lane players as D is going to be able to even out the trades both of them eating
1:34:06
through their potions but BK standing the ground ground just fine only a few CS in it and not really too much to
1:34:13
worry about double up not really doing too much there to lens either so as far as this bottom Lane is concerned a lot
1:34:18
of what Shen wants to do is affect the map later on it's not necessarily for the lane you pick this Champion but lens
1:34:24
has made it work a lot of times in the past he's in fact played 30 games of shen support th far like a lot he loves
1:34:32
walking this champion in he's a big fan of it I feel like if
1:34:37
uh there was a you know silus um angle for support for him there was Shen on the other side be like I'm playing syus sports so I get that Shen oh he would
1:34:43
love that yeah he just Loves Shen alting and uh he's got good decision making
1:34:49
nice buffer on the counter strike there from kingan his matchup is not going to really explode until we see junglers up
1:34:55
here yep as a lot of like you press your e button I press mine which is uh sort of the mine game with this particular
1:35:01
matchup always being a fun one and always being like what feels like the ultimate skill matchup for our split
1:35:06
pushes of the Top Lane is Jax vers Camille yeah JX Camille Jack Fiora these types of match ups you really enjoy um
1:35:13
but you have to play it so carefully cuz one error and you're just like I'm not playing the game anymore nope uh and as
1:35:19
soon as one of them gets ahead it becomes a big problem which is again why uh so much is on Raptor's shoulders
1:35:24
right like if he is going to affect any Lane I think Top Lane is really really important but getting vicker ahead like
1:35:31
that could be another pressure point that bnk can manufacture for themselves but I think so much about this relies on
1:35:37
them doing that is yeah it's uh that's that's not no longer the World Champ difference there that is that is that is
1:35:43
that is uh King and proven he's still just a guy I didn't want to cut you off there but I was like I think someone has to make some sort of comment about this
1:35:50
don't worry twitch chat is right there for you don't worry that's a that's a minus quite a few different numbers uh that I assume are in the chat yeah it's
1:35:57
okay it happens to the best of us yep um J back down here towards the bottom side
1:36:03
and Nim with a little bit of a passive lead at the very beginning as the first dragon going to be that of a mountain
1:36:09
see what the next is we did get two chem Tech uh Souls yesterday uh for what felt
1:36:14
like the first time uh all tournament which is kind of crazy we've had a lot of infernal and hex tech it feels like
1:36:20
and not enough Cloud we did get one yesterday so I'm not too upset we had a
1:36:25
hex tech in game one so see what ends up transpiring here as we do have is J
1:36:31
going to be okay oh yeah he is uh as almost in leaf strike range so not going
1:36:36
to be punished quite for the Arcane ship forward good spacing the question is what do bnk get on the cross map here
1:36:43
you see Kellen wrapping around he's level three though and that's a the problem is is that with a Gallo he can
1:36:50
always just be there I feel like it's a bit of a cheat code here for and like when hits level Stand United is
1:36:57
going to provide even more support and you can sort of cheat your way around the map he's so close to Six as well
1:37:02
here just a few minions away and I don't think they can make this happen in time he's he's so confident too he's like you guys cannot do this he was in t range
1:37:10
that double up actually picks up the Agro and then kingan immediately lands the hook shot it's getting more and more
1:37:15
dangerous as Nong shim moving over like a unit so so fast get on these grubs so fast on the rotation you know no punish
1:37:22
there on the bottom side now oh God lens K is going to be able to sweep him
1:37:28
so there we go but lens once more there's a Shadow Dash Flash and they all pile on top of raptor he's taking down
1:37:34
dible going to have to cleanse as king and says you're not taking part in this fight and it should be three grubs going
1:37:41
over to Nong shim as well they'll take the first blood at the same time and they didn't have to use the xtech
1:37:47
ultimatum they didn't have to use the Gallo Al y they've still got that combo of buttons as clear wants to try and do
1:37:54
something leen's just going to dash his way over the wall and that is going to be that so there is the full round of
1:38:00
grubs that is going to be two objectives in quick succession here for Nim and they are just picking up where they left
1:38:05
off I mean fantastic rotation of play three grubs means 2/3 of that objective feat of strength they got first blood as
1:38:11
well so they're on their way for that one as well and this is the hen's taunt the flash play into the taunt from fer
1:38:16
you are just not getting out as Raptor and diao has to cleanse loses 2/3 of his health bar here is going to be
1:38:22
vulnerable on any sort of follow up contest with the hex tech ultimatum still being available Noam win bottom
1:38:28
side rotate faster get top side and Kell was trying to make something happen on King and they were slow on the play they
1:38:34
get nothing there and they're just you're not supposed to lose this hard on both sides of the map but no are winning
1:38:40
everywhere yeah and lens is taking a crab because rivash Shen is real and
1:38:45
alive here in the lck and we love to see never mind Gideon's going to be able to take it damn he getting started for I I
1:38:52
was I was ready to believe River Shen it was just a river Shen reference ah right
1:38:58
and he was in the river and Shen so technically still River Shen as yep Counter Strike the button was pressed
1:39:04
and that means it's on cool down and kingan is going to have a bit of an advantage in this moment but away from walls which is pretty good oh no oh God
1:39:13
different screen please as kingan immediately punishes him for it I mean stop it he's already in trouble
1:39:20
kingan as clear I mean he's still going to be able to farm does have the wave pushing into him so he's out of danger I
1:39:27
mean we're just not seeing really any punish here like raptor is trying to Clear Vision he's going to try to take red buff they're trying to use their mid
1:39:32
py which is slight by the way it's not even that strong but they they can't actually punish King in here on the top
1:39:38
side and if King is strong as well wolf it's like so hard yeah I know I it it's
1:39:43
looking like a disaster here well TR barage is going to soften up Diablo here just a little bit Mystic shots not quite
1:39:48
Landing just yet but uh the bottom Lane is just even no worries on either side
1:39:54
well I mean there are worries because that's a misfortune and it's making a lot of people quite uh quite unhappy uh
1:39:59
just in general I've seen a lot of people just not really like Misfortune right now she feels like a little bit of
1:40:05
a crutch pick picked up by some of our uh bottom laners as you Arcane shift going to counteract that ultimate quite
1:40:10
nicely as the barrier was invested he still wanted to go toe-to-toe and does lose out as far as that is concerned but
1:40:16
not going to be too worried as lens is going to turn up and he now has the spirits Refuge as
1:40:21
well um that he can provide for for you so if these Auto attack battles do start coming in can be a little bit of a worry
1:40:28
and with Jax there like who does like doing a few autos and stuff like that um
1:40:33
the Shen does do a whole lot of work he really does and you know fiser was actually in a position to where he could
1:40:38
have actually potentially gone over there and and look for an ult in to to trap them if they had stayed any further
1:40:45
King is totally fine here yeah there's a lot of these counter strikes that are just kind of going to the Wayside and
1:40:52
it's not that King's hard punishing or anything like that and is actually still behind in farm um but still we're seeing
1:40:59
that he's just getting through the lane just fine my concern is that there's not a big enough lead really anywhere
1:41:06
obviously there's a big farm lead for Raptor right now um and there's a slight Misfortune lead that you naturally get
1:41:12
in in this laning phase we didn't have the swap to come through we did have that isolated Jack Camille the normal
1:41:17
top uh go off and the azir is you know
1:41:22
in a situ where he wants to be ahead but he's down a kill but that that's fine but you really need to get this ball
1:41:28
rolling before Isel starts to get towards the 20 22 minute Mark hits those two items and is looking to to pop off
1:41:34
with an insane front line that he has with guaranteed lineups for his skill shots I mean that's the thing
1:41:40
is this is a two item comp that wants to press R and all Pile in on one target we saw Raptor suffer the uh the fate of
1:41:47
that and it I feel like Nim are only just warming up as far as what this composition does want to do K wants to
1:41:53
kill via I can feel it in my bones yeah the gold lead basically is actually a
1:41:59
deficit compositionally for b k they need more they need a bigger Advantage now starting these grubs they do have
1:42:04
pryo they're down on grubs they need these so desperately but we can start to see some R buttons pressed here for no
1:42:09
if they can group up yep Fisher uh not too worried about what clear is doing right now but the grubs are still being fought by
1:42:16
gide yeah they did lose control I was going to say I was pretty sure it was a
1:42:21
blue health bar that was uh over there so it's going to be five grubs but no feed of strength uh to be picked up here
1:42:26
for Nim the denial does come in from raptor doesn't overstay his welcome but this is the problem if you're playing to
1:42:32
like get some scraps that's not really what you want to be doing right now you mentioned I I mean there is there's a
1:42:38
lot of scaling right it's weird talking about azir and Jax as if like it's it's not quite going to work but it does it
1:42:43
does feel like Nong shim have so many answers for later on in the game exactly when everyone presses r on the azir how
1:42:49
scaled is he really if he's in the death chamber that's the concern I have um because yes if you say well azir is a
1:42:56
great late game not if he's dead and I am concerned he will not be alive well he is a stand United ladies and
1:43:01
gentlemen this is what this composition does it CCS you and kills you and you can't do anything about it and that's
1:43:08
the thing about the Jacks you're like oh I'm in a s Side Lane I win these you don't win these because it's always a 1 V2 unless you have somebody with you
1:43:14
it's so much taunting it's a double taunt that's not a very common CC in
1:43:19
this game um it's looking common in this game though is there's another another combo with the true shot barrage um L
1:43:25
doesn't win that 1 V one though so he's going to have to back away still a fair bit of damage and certainly looked cool it did look really cool uh and we do see
1:43:33
bnk are going to take this Dragon so it's a win for them teleport does come over to the top side as we see clear
1:43:39
return yeah and I mentioned it and uh and it appeared you it the chemtech soul
1:43:44
as Orcs is here um suster in the chat please fer does have ultimate but he's
1:43:50
in the Top Lane has teleport so take a lot of resource to protect King here if this dive does get committed to and no
1:43:57
Stand United this means that kingan is somewhat vulnerable but he does have the ultimate can they chain the CC the
1:44:02
answer is no they can't get anything Atlas there's nothing for this team yeah and they might even lose more as the
1:44:08
bullet time is going to soften up kingan uh didn't have a Target that he could uh utilize in order to go un targetable so
1:44:15
actually good use of that one from diao but I mean you don't really get too much out of it flash does get invested there
1:44:20
by kingan earlier on so they take something away going to have a look at this one more time let's see how much
1:44:25
gameplay uh clear is allowed to do he's let's see how much gameplay lens does
1:44:31
press r that was the knockup and he came down and then yeah and pressed e he
1:44:37
pressed e sure as well all right that's fair the e was pretty good and he was also he's here trying to steal away a
1:44:44
red buff lens woke up this morning and said I'm in the mood for an interview
1:44:49
yeah so he he just decided like I'm P today uh boys U this is what's happening
1:44:56
and he is he's going to get it if they win this game I I guarantee you this is just this is the lens that that we saw
1:45:04
like what was the final that lens basically solo won uh that was relatively recent oh the m one yeah he
1:45:10
just sometimes does it he just he just is the guy sometimes and he's also the other guy sometimes as well but today oh
1:45:17
man he is him well it was mentioned by the space it's been mentioned by us a little bit but you can't draft like this unless you have a the on in your bottom
1:45:24
L you know what I mean like you can't play the the double Global jump on top of people Crush Sid Lane with Camille
1:45:29
comp unless you're support players really good at Shen and Shen hasn't really been meta for a very long time in the support role uh we've seen it as a
1:45:36
niche pick right when lens picks it as a niche pick and it's just the the fact
1:45:42
that Nima is playing his strengths finally here it's at the end of the group battle stage but I feel like they didn't do index into this as hard as
1:45:47
they are today it's great to see like it's it's exciting well Stand United now going to be invested and clear was like
1:45:54
I was enjoying the 1 V one and Shadow Dash doesn't actually connect another Empower would have killed King and not
1:46:00
quite executed correctly there on the side of nim still with the St United King's going to survive no harm no foul
1:46:06
it's a win for bnk because they got Len's ultimate and that is you know where the good news stops o that was a
1:46:12
nice Emperor divide there from vicka now the sand solders getting some work done of course fer is able to uh take magic
1:46:18
damage quite comfortably so isn't going to die just yet but with some assistance could be a problem Justice punch going
1:46:24
to be blocked as at least has a small taunt there to stop the air from doing
1:46:29
too much more so should be able to march his way out of here but control of the Top Lane going to be important as Kellen
1:46:35
comes on over picks up the wave stopping these backs is uh pretty huge actually cuz he's going to get a ton of Damage
1:46:40
Done To That turret that may be the first turret of the game here going to B andk from that play so nicely done by
1:46:46
via a little bit greedy there by fer and will get pushed out and they're going to rush this one down you can see in return
1:46:52
King and his try to do the same thing but there's a lot of defensive members of bnk down there to stop that from
1:46:57
happening teleport will not be cancel but it doesn't save the turret either no it doesn't and in fact there's a new
1:47:03
turret and it's not the one of fishes so a very uh confusing little uh array of
1:47:09
plays as the gargoyle is sort of thrown around like a ragd doll but is going to survive because he does have a lot of
1:47:14
Health but otherwise still going to lose the turret lose that Fe of strength as well as b k are able to lock that one
1:47:20
down but one kill and one objetive and Nim have the sandals yeah so it's a
1:47:26
big win here for bnk but it's alone not enough and that's kind of been the story of a lot of this early game here for BN
1:47:31
K but they're getting some small victories right and it's part of the the power of the air that has that early nashers truth how quickly he could take
1:47:37
turrets out um you know fer down a Teleport that's huge as well even though he is you know semi- Global with his
1:47:43
ultimate just having that side lane on lock right now feels really good cuz via has teleport advantage and we get to
1:47:50
these next few objectives I mean they get the the uh Herald out of of this as well and bnk definitely have a real
1:47:55
fighting chance to actually win some team fights before this comp really just starts pressing R and as real as two
1:48:00
items and uh everybody dies if you can get some map control those combos become a little bit more difficult to execute
1:48:05
if King is trying to flank to set up his ultimate but then gets caught in said flank and get Emperor divided for example or Ed by Raptor there are
1:48:12
definitely ways to win this game um not in terms of necessarily scaling damage but in pick potential with the spy with
1:48:18
the Jacks with the ra combo potential you can absolutely win fights and B and K are keeping themselves in this after
1:48:24
what was a very Rocky start to the game yeah and Nong shim do need to execute well uh to make this composition work
1:48:29
right like we're talking about this as if diabl is never going to be able to do damage because we feel like playing Misfortune in a 5v5 scenario should be
1:48:37
next to Impossible with the fact that Gideon goes in and then there's you know the gargoyle lands on top of you there's King and finding a flank angle all these
1:48:44
sorts of uh threats that a misfortune can't really mitigate but they still have to do it this is a really cool
1:48:50
setup here though cuz they're going to crash this into mid clear is threatening top side yes they lost the bottom turret
1:48:55
but you can see via has teleport he's actually defending the bottom turret there this is a really good map play here for bnk and they lose a dragon for
1:49:02
this but I don't think they care well that is going to be the taunt coming down CLE should be able to get rid of this turret but it takes so long clear
1:49:09
will be taken down they're in the Thunder dor now Justice punch is served to Raptor but he is going to be able to
1:49:16
make it out with the Vault breaker vlo with a defensive ultimate B hands just Shadow dashes him and no uh sundisk is
1:49:23
going to protect you from that as Nong shim they can always collapse like this and I feel like B and K were playing
1:49:30
around this St United cool down so beautifully but as soon as they don't we
1:49:35
learn why this composition so hard to play I mean this could have looked so different if the Jax is able to get like
1:49:42
two more Autos off just a little bit faster this whole scenario looks different because maybe then he can actually help set up for this fight I me
1:49:48
look at how low this turret is and the taunt comes through can't hit the turret can't hit the turret can't hit the
1:49:53
turret and then like another taunt yep and then the gall on top of everything and then their Misfortune is not here so
1:50:02
Kell's like oh we could do something and they have an emperor divide right the teleport advantage that the azir had from bottom Lane they have so many
1:50:08
pieces here they're just like a sliver off of having an amazing team fight after already making such a good macro
1:50:14
play but I mean I think that they like playing World of warc you with two tanks in a raid group they they're like
1:50:20
constant taunting and over and over again L hens just says I'm the big bro
1:50:25
uh I'm I'm the older brother and uh that's a literal translation of what he said there and this game he is uh still
1:50:33
I thought leading up to that moment great macro though from BN K really good usage of their teleport Advantage playing the map but you're just always
1:50:40
going to be down when your support has that ability to teleport himself and turn a fight he's two levels above
1:50:46
Kellen as well like lens is really he's he's really
1:50:52
having a game this is this is the lens that we wanted to see on Nim and it is finally working they're going to have to
1:50:58
figure it out though as far as closing this game out 2,000 gold is their lead currently they do manage uh to pick up
1:51:04
the Feats of Strength as well as adakan is going uh to be on the top side of the
1:51:09
map as he does appear I assume it's voracious as lens I mean all good things
1:51:15
must come to an end right uh so he will be taken down not quite sure what he was really doing there as diabl is going to
1:51:21
be able to take down this turret going to connect and yeah you're exactly right sometimes you cast a curse
1:51:26
sometimes it's lens I'm not entirely sure you could blame us you could just uh accept that it lands and right now I
1:51:33
mean there's a big advantage in terms of map control to BN K they're not in a gold lead and Nim are down just one
1:51:41
turret but critically the mid turret is gone and this means that you can flank and and Crush King and insides even
1:51:47
though he has his Global friends um you can collapse on this and take out this outer turret relatively easily clear
1:51:52
we'll get away with this back it looks like uh Len's just clearing a Ward and goes for a taunt on this one actually so
1:52:00
oh he was just fighting Kell for a long time yeah that was kind of weird I I want to give a bit oh he's got clear
1:52:06
award then he he just decides to stay for some reason yeah um he's probably
1:52:11
like telling J like why didn't you come and J was like I'm not inting man yeah I'm just going to let you if you want to
1:52:17
keep fighting there you you you go for it uh that was a bit bizarre y I mean it was uh it was I guess it's just a bit
1:52:24
lens and it's fine uh doesn't really affect the game too much but getting that out of tting mid lane certainly is
1:52:30
important as Kellen thinks he might have found fer here wins of War go down there's another taunt to stop the rest
1:52:35
of the engage Gideon's going to be here but now fer might have to go home does elect to do so this is a two item VI you
1:52:42
know and the Gallo build doesn't offer you a whole lot of armor and obviously he already has the cleaver so you do rip
1:52:49
through that Gallo Health pretty quickly as Raptor so every time you encounter him like that you can really push him out of a side that's going to get his
1:52:55
teleport too yep TR barage is going to spot what's going on around this aan
1:53:01
thought that there is a control Ward there as once again they're diving on top of lens but this time he's got giddy
1:53:07
in there and now the rest of the teammates turn up teleport coming forward Fisher Justice punches his way
1:53:12
out they get a Teleport out of b k but temp disengage the tempo here for B and
1:53:18
K is just immense they get the teleport out of fer they get the ult out of f they're faster on the play kingan also
1:53:25
TPS but isn't able to set up that flank like he wants to they get chased Away by a two item air who hits really hard in
1:53:31
these scenarios so you can't really mess around with trying to rotate back in and going for that kingan collapse like they hope to speaking of king oh okay Dia was
1:53:40
out of vision and so kingan didn't know that he could have potentially killed a misfortune and I mean once again nin
1:53:46
grouping here towards the top side of the map oh vicker is in so much trouble fer is going to spot him out but the
1:53:52
teleport that's going to scoot him out of there but that gives a huge amount of pry for oton right now bnk need to
1:53:58
rotate fast clear does not have teleport this is a huge problem well yeah and uh via definitely doesn't have teleport
1:54:04
because he just used it to get out of the way of right here where where he wants to be as now kingan looking for an
1:54:10
opportunity St United comes down emperess divide does absolutely nothing
1:54:15
and down goes Raptor Kell not sure what he's doing as I look back towards the rest of the fight hook shot not going to
1:54:21
get vler but now he's out of the fight as well clear standing in amongst it but none of his friends are around and Nong
1:54:27
shim just going one after the other and CLE survives for way longer than he would like to be now two of the damage
1:54:33
dealers are up but no one else I mean via he alone would have to rip through these health bars here if they're going
1:54:39
to contest and they just simply opt out even though everyone's super low on the side of nim lens is going to take some
1:54:44
damage here they're going to have to juggle the aggro meanwhile you see via pushing into that inner they are going to try to take down this Dragon but the
1:54:49
oton is way more important here via whiffing that ultimate is so massive I think if he had saved it there and had
1:54:56
at least hit Le hens but like he had actually gotten a high value setup there maybe they could have actually stopped that objective but man I was talking
1:55:03
about how they had such good Tempo and they threw it all away I mean via having to to teleport to escape here just
1:55:09
guarantees oton goes over and yeah this is kind of a disaster kingan has the shield the UL here
1:55:15
doesn't hit anybody and B has all of their damage right now essentially and so he's not able to actually long-term
1:55:22
fight here because he's just shoved out of this fight by that Camille even though clear by his time here he's not
1:55:27
hitting anybody VI is not hitting anybody he's like I'm a want to reach over and hit him but we just don't have a front line anymore we don't have a bu
1:55:33
the ja is gone and alone and you know he could have a lot of teams would have actually just gone over there and tried
1:55:38
to stop them but he was like uh it's too risky we're just going to get the midin and back away but that means Noam have
1:55:44
Aon with their double Global with the Camille and they're looking to start really taking that map control back I
1:55:50
mean they already have it now but they're going to it Baron's up in 10 seconds time they've Gotan for another minute and a half this
1:55:57
is so high value Justice punch to stop clear from doing anything at all as fer is just dancing around the river and
1:56:05
here comes Baron perfect timing says Nong shim it's 7 to1 as far as kill score is concerned you can see the gold
1:56:11
is really not a whole lot in it to be perfectly honest but Nim have really had
1:56:16
BK's number all day so far and this comp doing exactly what we expected it to do
1:56:22
nin piloting it really really well at the same time Justice punch not quite Landing but honestly fer has had a great
1:56:29
day as well this Gallo performance has been phenomenal it's really good I want to see him play it more yeah me too this
1:56:35
is the Nim that we wanted to see and I'm just so glad that it's finally here as they do back away from the baron
1:56:42
they do want to pick up a bnk member who a straggler and that might be Kell not
1:56:48
tagged by the last Mystic shot there will be able to make his way out but Nim critically Kell does not have flash so
1:56:54
his ability to engage on this composition is significantly limited by
1:57:00
that lack of Summoner so it's hard for him to set up a combo for Misfortune via has his ult and can do a ton of damage
1:57:06
but it's closing the Gap that's so difficult now they're just kind of sitting on a sundisk and this is once again Noam starting this up with vision
1:57:12
control and someone's going to have to go in someone's going to have to face check and I mean you you have no
1:57:17
information to set up a combo Kell has to be the guy well they do have information on where kingan is M Kellen is still likely to die gets the magnet
1:57:24
storm off as now Gideon with that Crescent guard trying to keep himself safe heroic entrance going to bring
1:57:30
Fisher over there The Winds of War as well as clear's going to go down there's a beautiful ta yeah Misfortune can't
1:57:35
play the game that was never going to be a thing rap to try to flash but it's a triple for jiu and he's even going to
1:57:41
let the vi live because Nong shim just want to take apart the base of being or
1:57:47
maybe they changed their minds they want a purple buff they can take anything the world's their oyster going to take a
1:57:52
purple buff and then take away the base so they're going to get the baron gold and the order I messed up I guess yeah
1:57:58
we've been giving Kell a lot of flack for his performance in this series in this case I'm a little bit I I kind of
1:58:04
feel like the team should have been more with him on on setting up because he's face checking there and setting up that Ward but he can instantly ult if the
1:58:12
team is there maybe they can get something out of it he gets his ult off it's not the greatest one but they're also the followup was very late and then
1:58:18
obviously with all of the tools at noad that we've been talking about all game long they just crushed the fight and they've got like they've got a million
1:58:24
buttons that can CC all of the carries and I think that's why vicker and Diablo haven't been able to follow up because
1:58:30
they have to wait for so many cool Downs to to be to be not available because otherwise they can't walk up because
1:58:36
they instantly die in a chain of CC that losts like the entire game length and like when you think about the emperor
1:58:42
divide value into everybody collapsing on one place like oh that would be sick I mean you just push all of them away they don't come in all at the same time
1:58:48
it's like the Camille comes first then the shin comes then the IO comes and all the while while you're waiting for those
1:58:54
the big globals to land you're dead like you can't wait for that but also they come in with a shield and then a Shen
1:59:00
taunts you for half your life like it's horrible it's it is it is frustrating but uh if you're an onction fan you're
1:59:07
pretty happy with it now you can see b k it's looking a little bit desperate 5,000 gold behind now the redel baron
1:59:13
power play sitting at close to 1,600 but that is only going to extend as kingan looks to take down his first inner
1:59:20
turret on this top side once again out of position and no way that you can be walking around trying to
1:59:26
get Vision at this stage of the game and for the DN freaks this is great
1:59:32
news you know I mean they're looking at potentially just getting into playin here off of no Victory and you know they
1:59:40
they earned that win that they got and that's the Difference Maker and on the other side bnk they were in control of
1:59:45
their Destiny but really struggling here in this series a must win for them it's
1:59:50
not over till it's over but it is is looking pretty over at this point Atlas it's pretty dire Nim as well I think
1:59:57
that if you're this roster with these players you want to be higher in the standings you don't want to be one of
2:00:03
the teams that is struggling in the bottom five is oh my God Dia just explodes emperess divide does manage to
2:00:10
get some damage back but look at this non say thanks for the engage angle and
2:00:15
just obliterate them I mean the wallets were heavy but I didn't know that their
2:00:21
knees were this weak and their palms with this sweaty wolf yeah kingan I I
2:00:27
think he's in danger but not maybe I'm wrong cuz he's Camille yeah uh well kingan is just going to give him a
2:00:32
thumbs up Fischer is going to knock him all up uh he goes golden as well just to show how cool he is and then he dies uh
2:00:38
that is going to be wrapped or at least keeping him keeping him honest but in the meantime as you can see Nong shim
2:00:44
are winning the game Gideon wind becomes lightning but Nexus becomes exploded and
2:00:50
Nong sham are going to pick up the two over BK FX what an incredible
2:00:56
performance finally I say for the noodle boys yeah and they were at the bottom of
2:01:02
the most dominant group like they're competing within their group with D+
2:01:08
undefeated gen G you know MSI Champions super team KT rolster who is actually
2:01:14
surprisingly doing quite well and then DRX who had a some really phenomenal performances with lazy field and and UK
2:01:21
and Rich performance pering better than I think a lot of people expected they end up going two and three at the end of the group but it was a very competitive
2:01:27
group very dominant here for group Elder as they pick up their 16th and final win
2:01:32
here of the group battle and you know for BN K I think there's a lot of
2:01:38
learning that needs to happen between now and lck because they have a roster that I think exceeded our expectations at least exceeded mine in terms of what
2:01:44
their performance was like but it's still isn't enough yeah and you know this is the depth of the champion pool
2:01:51
of Leen and what this team can do with it that we when we saw this roster we were hoping for Fearless really empowers
2:01:57
it I want to see Noam lean into this a lot more because this is the kind of draft that can catch even a team like
2:02:03
Han life off guard because you just don't see drafts like this all the time you don't scrim against them all the time you're not necessarily super ready
2:02:10
for how this is all going to play out I thought bnk played the early uh macro game decently well but once they got
2:02:16
picked AP part once they just looked super lost yeah they really did but uh I I just I want to talk about Nim because
2:02:23
this team we've been waiting for this man and I'm just so happy that we finally see it B K I think you're right
2:02:28
and it's so weird to say like they've exceeded our expectations when I think a lot of us had them in last place and
2:02:34
that's kind of where they are um but the performance like diabl I think looked a lot better than I expected especially
2:02:41
just wasn't enough uh to pick them up a victory outside of stealing some games away here and there and now they've got
2:02:46
a long break before the lck starts of course lck cup still with some time to go but they're not going to be challenging for that top spot in that uh
2:02:54
First International the treat that we get the beginning of the year it's uh not going to be one that we'll see b k
2:03:00
FX uh along at no it is uh this format is pretty forgiving but one team doesn't
2:03:07
go yeah and uh they are the one so coming in as the weakest team for the
2:03:12
lck means there's a lot to improve and oh I mean just Mo moves like this you
2:03:19
know these clutch plays these these angles that leens sees his experience on these unusual support picks is just the
2:03:25
lens's DI you know and I thought also with a wild champion pool like GI has like this this is going to be a super
2:03:32
fun bottom Duo to watch and I think for a lot of this tournament they kept it pretty standard pretty real yeah we saw Le Hens play at least before but you
2:03:39
know pulling out the Shen here instead of just playing something normal in this game and just closing it out in a flashy way like you said it's what we've been
2:03:45
waiting for it's what we've been wanting and if you're a Noam fan it's got to feel really nice sure you're still
2:03:51
bottom of your group but you got two wins and you know that's that's two more
2:03:56
than your opposition has had today right you feel like you're going into play ends with some extra momentum yeah and
2:04:01
there's a lot of like room for development in the planes as well like there's a like best of fives or a lot of
2:04:07
games to play and if Nong shim keep playing these really fun compositions playing them well playing them well
2:04:13
coordinated this is going to be such a fun team to watch and also a scary one for the opposition because they are so
2:04:19
flexible like you were saying like you got lence he can just play lots of weird
2:04:24
stuff and J was no stranger to that either is oh God this was this was a jump scare yeah this was I mean we
2:04:31
mentioned it already Diablo was never playing this game no um sadly I I also
2:04:37
feel like this was one of the the only decisions you could not make here at this point in time to try to defend like
2:04:43
you know you have a misfortune maybe you play around your Nexus turrets but going in there into this comp that has so much nuh I've got taunts for days I've got
2:04:50
shields for days was be this was a funny one yeah this was
2:04:56
hilarious King look at his he's got like a nervous smile he's like oh sorry about that one I want to see fer play more
2:05:02
utility man if he can play G like this I want to see him play Karm okay you know like I bring back the Lulu let's go asz
2:05:11
I haven't trusted a lot of his damage dealers especially 80 carries last year but if he can play Gallo like this I
2:05:16
wonder what else he's got in his pocket well J is going to top the damage here we can see like clear uh actually had an
2:05:22
okay time uh against King in the lane but it just really felt like he was never able to really do anything at all Raptor gave it his best shot but I felt
2:05:29
like compositionally it was a master stroke from Nong shim and B K not really
2:05:35
able to give diao anything that he could actually do so you can see dropped off a cliff as far as gold was concerned and
2:05:42
clean two Z nothing to see here from Nong shim yeah two sub 30 minute games no surprise lens get it the most obvious
2:05:49
um this was the lens as we mentioned the that felt like giving an interview today yeah I imagine it will likely be
2:05:55
unanimous as well I I would hope so I I think there were a lot of players had a great uh time in game two there with him
2:06:03
um but with his performance in game one it just like it has to be him like he was the best player both games y he is just him that is uh that is how it goes
2:06:10
and he's also one of the greatest interviews that we have uh here in the LSK as well full of Charisma so I'm excited that we do get to have a chat to
2:06:16
him at the same time one of the biggest moves you could say from uh the Stove league from the offseason was kingan and
2:06:22
Lens two of these huge veteran names going over to nin which was known as the sort of rookie team here in the lck yeah
2:06:29
I I just really excited to see lens 2 on a a roster that I think isn't as High
2:06:34
Caliber as some of the ones he's been on last time let's see what he can accomplish with a team like this I'd love to see it yep and I'd love to hear
2:06:40
from him as well so now it is time to throw it over to the interview take it away dear thank you very much guys this is s
2:06:47
for the P interview translation joined by leens on the side
2:06:52
[Music] congratulations thank
2:06:58
you you just got out of your last group battle match how do you feel now I really wanted to finish
2:07:04
strong with the Victory and I'm very relieved that we're able to do that and I didn't really think that it was a
2:07:09
clean match but I think I would say I'm pretty satisfied and we
2:07:17
got a new record on the last day of group battle match which was our very
2:07:23
first support P today how do you feel know the reason I was able to even
2:07:31
get a p today is because of all the fans that have paid us a visit today so thank
2:07:36
you I would like to return the favor and say thank you to everyone and it's no surprise that
2:07:42
you're a good Elise support player but your game one Elise play was almost like Spider-Man and even during the draft you
2:07:48
took Elise quickly so do you think Elise belong to the top of theer list yeah a lot of supports actually do
2:07:57
uh favor playing atast and I think I have been one of those players that have been playing lece support from a very
2:08:03
long time ago so yes I do believe that LE is great and
2:08:10
yeah did you want to go ahead and go ahead and uh was it your decision
2:08:19
to go with Elise yeah I think I really did appeal to the team and I wanted to
2:08:24
be vocal about playing elast today and in game two Cloud Templar the Shen
2:08:30
enjoyer was so excited about your Shen support so can you walk us through the Shen
2:08:38
pick know I'm I'm really glad that I was able to show you a give you a good show
2:08:44
Cloud temper thank you for your support and anything you would like to say to
2:08:49
Dean freaks since they were able to ad the you know maybe you guys should
2:08:54
should treat us take us out to dinner sometime
2:09:01
you I hope that we all can be successful and now okay Savings Bank
2:09:07
Brion will be your first opponent in the plan stage so please share your
2:09:14
resolution so we just have to climb up from where we are right now so I hope
2:09:20
that we become an even cool and an amazing team over time and that's
2:09:25
the end of the interview with Le please stay tuned for the super hyped episode two of L mens and now throwing it back
2:09:31
to the space thank you thank you very much dear I'm super
2:09:38
hyped after that translation AA as welcome back to the space it's a clean two for the noodle boys nothing to see
2:09:45
here as they take care of business moving into the playin stage Deon alongside Mr Daniel Ox Harrison and the
2:09:54
vald danst here Bron Valdez that is my name alongside of the danst uh Dan you
2:10:00
had something you want to say no I just want to talk about we had the P lens pretty good I see okay yeah um I think
2:10:08
very deserving and I think ultimately when we have lens uh wow everyone deser
2:10:14
it when we have lens playing pick out there it's pretty hype he did play
2:10:21
pretty well in game one and then he was an absolute passenger in game two I
2:10:26
don't know he should have should have been on the left Leen hype train I think we need we need a comment from John
2:10:32
Strong right now yeah I I don't think that's going to happen we're freaking out I was just kidding production all right let's get to our comments though
2:10:39
oh Leen stiff very good very good oh yeah cuz he
2:10:45
played Shen is you know has like if you take the S out it it looks like his name
2:10:51
it actually it is his name because that's really you know what
2:10:57
that's a good point is a pretty good point I do think uh you know your comment as well is
2:11:04
pretty Neato yeah I mean I think this is when hens is at his best like I don't think Shen or Elis are like that crazy
2:11:12
in him of support picks like we've seen the Alise before we've seen Shen support before but when he's g a little bit more out there compared to the traditional
2:11:18
supports like moving away from things like Leon Alistar I think that's when we get the best lens a lot of people
2:11:23
remember things like his sing support and Yumi and it really is when you see him flourish the most as a player let's
2:11:29
see what else that we had from our Caster that was on the call my champion
2:11:35
pool is lender right so this one if you actually
2:11:40
switch the H for a G is legendary the H H yeah he is half a little actually a
2:11:48
quarter Irish that's true yeah they do say it like that I see uh you had a Spider-Man fact for us real quick he's
2:11:55
from New York City actually oh really yeah yeah I actually no a guy from New York City crazy with him yeah he might
2:12:00
be on the far side of the couch uh Helio saying it's me L hens I'm just this good
2:12:08
see leen's gift was better than that one say it's me lens I'm just this good
2:12:13
usually other people will say leg this one actually explains wolves this actually explains the followup
2:12:20
explanation thank you so much Ras he just with the observant eye yes just one
2:12:25
letter yeah if people were confused you know we had our explanation with Ras beas to it I I brought my Korean my
2:12:32
Korean comprehension book today and now I feel like we're getting the english comprehension lesson as well that was
2:12:38
good all right let's take a look at the draft here because uh the guys on the the the casting desk were pretty adamant
2:12:44
that it was very very difficult to play what say you to analysts yeah I really don't like the MF here it's so to play
2:12:51
in this composition it feels about as questionable as trading Luca to the Lakers and when you're when you're into
2:12:58
Camille when you're into Gallo when you into zenza and Shen you're just never going to be able to press old there's just no chance of it the jack at least
2:13:05
has like good value into zenza and Camille but then you couldn't even pressure the Sid lane cuz of the Shen and the Gallo threats being there so I
2:13:12
just think it it was rough from the draft you know uh Nim they built a real
2:13:18
composition it was five uh players they had multiple globals with the Gallia
2:13:23
with the Shen you could be all over the map you couldn't win the sidelines as you mentioned they had Ezreal which is fantastic to always be in position uh
2:13:30
shinal nice front line and B bnk had five Champions yeah they were missing a
2:13:36
big there were one big away let's take a look at our first highlight here as it is the leen's show as he was everywhere
2:13:43
early on and I mean this is a power of the Shen you know in these side Lanes where typically Jacks can flourish
2:13:49
especially in likes of the Camille who we see this next match up into H you just can't have the same pressure this is a 1 V one where even though it
2:13:56
doesn't end up resulting in a kill of the Camille Jack was winning this the Shen comes in he has to disengage from
2:14:02
the situation uh and it just means not only do you have scenarios where you're finding kills in the S Side Lane you're
2:14:07
losing your pressure in the Sid Lane the Gallo also has options there uh and it just means that you know the Sid Lane
2:14:13
win conditions kind of doomed for the side of uh bnk FX but also the team fights what kind of doomed for them too
2:14:19
because the engage is so good with this conf from what what is the ideal fight here for BK fix what what would that
2:14:26
have looked like do you think Dan I mean I guess if they kind of botch the engage
2:14:31
if they come in and they pick the wrong target Jack Counter-Strike gets a lot of value maybe MF for some reason they
2:14:37
can't reach it there's like you know enough members in the way to body block and she gets a big ult across everyone
2:14:43
but it's it's like you're kind of relying on the other team messing up and when I'm talking about the messing up it's like they're messing up Camille
2:14:49
Gallo which is like one of the easiest com to play with Shen you just press
2:14:54
press it's like it's not hard and that's the fact that you're kind of hoping for that to go wrong it shows how dire was
2:15:00
you know we did have some fights that actually looked like that cuz no weren't super clean with this comp either which
2:15:06
was kind of funny but it was like they had to get ahead uh bnk to do really anything but even with Nim kind of
2:15:12
messing it up they still couldn't do anything and then finally here this is the Highlight that closed the game on
2:15:18
off with azir by vicka getting caught out uses TP to get out but then oh look
2:15:23
what's spawning right now it's on on the top side of the map yeah it's a bit unfortunate maybe if
2:15:30
you had I mean you could have gone to the the tier two Tower that's still up maybe there was something closer he could teleport to but I don't think he
2:15:35
was really focused on that the moment but to teleport down immediately like oh wait I got to come back quickly um so
2:15:42
yeah maybe the Tier Two Towers some minions would have would have put him a little bit less far away but uh you can
2:15:47
see that for the Sim they start this off but immediately they're to turn around make it happen H The Divide comes out
2:15:53
the emperess divide a pretty good tool against Nim com but doesn't get any value there yeah I mean this is one of
2:15:58
the fights I was talking about it's not even that super clean right it took them a lot of tools to try to kill Raptor
2:16:04
who's just one guy and clear's full health he tries to do something kind of just Dives in desperately against four
2:16:10
he dies for free it was just you know they were scrambling on the side of bnk to get near them and then you just have
2:16:16
a million tools almost literally on the side of noin to just press all your buttons engage on to a weak Target and
2:16:22
take them down I think that's the thing when there's a draft difference like this it's not like it's impossible but it just makes it difficult and one team
2:16:28
has more tools than other to make it work well you know what we have here at the lck one of the best production teams
2:16:33
because I did ask for a comment just like you all at home were wondering what was Jonna strong thinking and didn't the
2:16:40
ADC deserve vote all right Jon strong was justs tossing a boat out
2:16:47
there I mean Jonah strong we know he loves to be the odd one out so I think this is his good moment he is an 8 carry
2:16:53
player to say hey I you know I think you was good but he didn't deserve it for this one yeah uh that's okay JN is
2:17:00
strong getting that one in there thanks to our production team for making that one happen with this loss though that does mean we say goodbye for the final
2:17:07
time until April b k FX so get the 07s in the chat for that one we'll see you
2:17:12
back in April BK FX I'm sure they'll be able to bounce back stronger now it's time for our best ceremonies of the week
2:17:20
it was a little bit shorter as we had a couple of less matches but we still had some good ones and we start off with the
2:17:27
maker of show it is showmaker just doing the little the little spin right here
2:17:32
yeah the Ronaldo celebration the James Harden celebration or Serge Gaby I mean he did play trenia maybe he's indicating
2:17:39
I like to spin you know Spin to Win oh this is the this is definitely the winner he didn't want to do this one he
2:17:45
was he was so shy nous but he he did it he committed you know Shy Boy Sho for
2:17:50
you yeah right now showmaker in the lead also we got this from lens today watch
2:17:56
out he's about to taunt you he's right into the CER he did he did this yeah all
2:18:01
right I think showmaker wins by about a million billion points what do you mean I think I think she I think it's ch Chad
2:18:08
help us out here like this is he's just doing the thing he always does look showmaker has been here for years right
2:18:13
he he he this this is like she was first p goes and I think he nailed it I think he did a great job I think it was it was
2:18:20
a bit half hearted from both of them I'll give you that I'm very surprised we're pretty split like I I liked how
2:18:26
close lens got to the cameraman he like I this guy is such a hater you know he's a little bit of a hater yeah he really
2:18:31
yeah I want to see you see I like to see showmaker happy that's it that's fat
2:18:36
that's valid you know if ma was here he'd say something like yeah I agree I love showmaker all right the Sho ones
2:18:42
are popping off or at least they're the loudest so we'll keep going uh we'll keep counting while we take a look at
2:18:47
the standings the group stage is finally over and was dominated by group Elder we
2:18:53
have our slots all locked down in moving to the playoffs and taking a little bit of a sabatical will be DK geneng G and
2:19:01
KT your one two and three then your number one seed for the plins will be T1
2:19:07
with Hana life is two DRX then nongshim then the Bros and sliding into that
2:19:13
final slot thanks to the bnk FX lost or the DN Automotive freaks you get to see
2:19:19
a little bit more of them I think what's kind of cra crazy is you look at group Elder and only really D+ do I feel like
2:19:25
has looked like consistently solid gen has kind of been under expectations we've seen like some like you know
2:19:31
moments where KT DRX and Nim have looked a little bit off but despite that they're just so far ahead of group Baron
2:19:37
like it's kind of crazy cuz I don't look at like KT and d and think yeah KT looked 100% solid but they really were
2:19:43
just leagues ahead of group Baron um and you could see from the scores he wasn't even close the scor is on the side of
2:19:50
group Baron uh pretty rough even the fact that H Sports you know they had to take two losses to DK and geni I think
2:19:57
the fact that DK were just so dominance really kind of changed everything because you know there could have been a world where maybe H life beats them or
2:20:03
maybe you know another team that isn't bro but the thing is able to challenge you know the thing is if D plus a 550
2:20:09
and if you just removed those Five Points then they still had 11 so true
2:20:15
yeah as a group very far ahead let's take a look at the play stage bra here
2:20:21
again the top seeds from these two or from first and second will get the Buys
2:20:26
so that means our first match will be DRX versus the DN Automotive freaks then
2:20:31
it will be Nong shim the noodle Boys versus the Bros it's the Battle of that week one matchup and the winner of those
2:20:37
will then play the seated teams in T1 and Hana life Esports but if you lose
2:20:44
you still have an opportunity to make it on in three teams will then slot into the playoffs which we have that bracket
2:20:49
for you as well yeah I think it's pretty cool I'm excited to see what bro can do honestly I feel like of the four teams in round
2:20:55
one they've impressed the most uh I think the match against T1 if they make it there in round two might be tough but then we have the the double limb from
2:21:02
there so I think it's going to be some hype matches and excited to see uh us get deeper in the tournament and
2:21:07
eventually when we get to those best of fives and have failers there it's going to be really cool yeah uh that's really what I'm looking forward to as well I I
2:21:14
think that obviously from this one T1 seems like the strongest team by far even over hum life Esports you know who
2:21:21
are not even a close second in my mind I think especially with smash coming in T1 should be the favorites to get that
2:21:26
fourth seed but we'll have to play out the games and see how it goes all right let's take a look at the playoffs which
2:21:32
we've got D+ and gen already waiting Seated on into round two KT will play
2:21:38
The Bottom seed of this playing stage which means seeds four and five will be
2:21:44
doing battle early on in this one uh you you made a pretty big face there Brandon
2:21:49
what what caught you ey I think just you know that fourth and fifth are going to go up against each other which has a
2:21:56
pretty high chance of being T1 versus H life Esports right at the beginning of the tournament for that one so a really
2:22:02
huge matchup I I think that KT for me out of these three is the obvious kind of odd one out that snuck into playoffs
2:22:09
right away and uh even them against the six seeds should be a close match yeah I mean if it's the six seed ends up being
2:22:15
like bro I could see bro and the thing is I feel like normally we have get his up full season we go playes we go into
2:22:23
playoffs and you look at it you're like well this team's like really far ahead this team's really far ahead this team probably compet be this team but
2:22:29
honestly based on how the teams have been playing looking at this I I feel like a lot of upsets could happen like
2:22:35
geneng G are in round two here right one of our top two teams so far in terms of where they are in the the bracket but
2:22:40
they have not looked convincing only D+ I feel like is the only team I'm like they are definitely going to win most
2:22:47
likely whoever they go up against but I think everyone else is kind of a bit of a a aw up yeah we'll see how that all
2:22:52
