38:40
enjoy
38:50
te welcome everybody to another day of the 2025 lck cup we are here on the
38:58
third day of this week a lovely Friday afternoon I am Valdez with me is ax today and we're going to be getting into
39:04
some really hype matches starting off with h life Esports who added zos to their Top Lane and jeng who have added
39:11
ruler to their bot Lane looking pretty fun yeah I think this is the matchup everyone's been waiting for I'm talking
39:16
about n stream against bro but that is later first we do have to get going to be so I it will be pretty hype I think
39:24
those rers are fun but yeah I mean this is the repeat of the summer finals where H got the upset and managed to very
39:30
narrowly beat out gen so both teams have had roster changes and this is our first opportunity to have a look at them yeah
39:37
you know generally we've had uh some I I believe we've had times where we've had like geni versus T1 fight off in the
39:44
first week and it's always really hyp because generally the those were the teams at the top and at the finals but
39:50
as you mentioned it will be a rematch these are the only two teams to not play so far so after this first match we will
39:57
we have our first kind of round robin matches finished and uh we'll see where
40:04
the lineups between group Baron and group Elder do sit currently group Elder in the lead even if they do lose today
40:11
they will still have the lead 3 to2 as here is the new lineup of H life ESP
40:17
Sports it's not that new but the one thing that's new is really huge yeah I
40:22
mean to change any one player and still have it to be the most significant change I feel like uh for the season is
40:27
pretty massive z a huge addition to H IP Sports and it just feels like every lane
40:33
is now a Powerhouse uh really formidable and on the other side a lot of geni on
40:38
the top the top side's being kept the same but the change up on the bot Lane ruler coming in coming back from jdg in
40:44
the LPL H and jro coming from uh being K Rex right yeah coming over so jro it
40:51
kind of feels similar to Delight um where when he came onto geni you know coming from a low Brank team uh I think
40:58
the hype maybe a little bit lower but we got to see what he can do pair with ruler has a pretty formidable Lane uh
41:04
partner to have so high expectations I feel like any roster with chov on there's always high expectations but you
41:10
add in Canyon you add in Keane you add in ruler jro you know he had a pretty decent season if he just you know
41:15
continues playing and stepping up I think this roster will unsurprisingly be one of our top dogs absolutely I I think
41:21
that zi have uh a bit to prove right they weren't able to quite get it done at Worlds they wen't weren't able to
41:27
quite get it done at the end of summer this was kind of the team that everybody was looking for the Golden Road for they
41:33
made some changes and they won blood this year we'll see if they can pick it up as they've got a huge opponent ahead
41:40
of them tonight Amal Esports up against gen G as they do the simultaneous
41:46
walkouts a new cool feature of the 2025 lck cup and we get our fist bumps here
41:54
see if anything funny happens no stock standard very
41:59
respectful I I'm just I'm I'm ready to get into the games I'm hyped it's going to be a good one uh and I feel like hle
42:06
has a little bit more to prove with the fact that their group has been struggling as you said even if they win this it'll still be two to three so got
42:13
to represent for those wondering uh if their group does lose they still can be in the tournament top three teams will
42:18
have a chance to play to go further but you definitely want to be the winning team H and the top three teams from the
42:24
winning group will go straight through uh to the playoff portion of the lck cup
42:29
so a lot on the line here and H being the captain of their team essentially they were the ones who were first to
42:35
pick uh they were the leaders of that group definitely want to represent yeah you know as you mentioned
42:41
you want to get wins for your team and you and you want to get wins for yourself um as a team here's zos Big
42:49
focus on him from the side of production for a good reason I think that Doran offered a lot of stability uh espe
42:57
domestically for the side of H ESP Sports whereas zos he he's kind of that X Factor you know he can go hardcore he
43:04
can go very heavily into the carry oriented picks whereas Dorne didn't really have that too much in his Arsenal
43:10
nowadays like he was good but he's not zus so I think it's still a big upgrade here for H ESP Sports and I think people
43:17
talked a bit about okay well now you have three lanes which could be potentially resource intensive like is
43:22
this going to work is this going to be too many cooks in the kitchen but I would say if you look at how Z was playing last year particularly when it
43:28
was that Lan swap meta he was actually doing a pretty fantastic job at playing the weak side cuz I mean it was a very
43:33
weak side when you're playing a lan meta for a Top Lane and there's a lot of times he was outplaying Dives outplaying
43:39
attempts when they were trying stack on uh the weak side so I I think that Z has
43:44
a lot of flexibility as a player yes he can play those carries he can also play a more defensive style if the team needs
43:50
and you know I'd agree with what you said I think it is just an upgrad all round but we'll see how it ends up being
43:55
implemented uh and how h work with him and obviously gen you know ruler I feel
44:00
like he's going to fit in pretty easily considering uh you know paay had a style of play that was somewhat similar to
44:06
ruler he was there to kind of replace ruler's role and now they have the original back H the question for me really is jro how he fits in um and I do
44:13
think he had as I said a decent split but I think pretty pretty high sort of
44:19
uh expectations for being on gen consider considering the two previous supports we Delight in L hands a lot to
44:26
live up to hoping for a pentac kill here for ruler and there he is it's just so
44:31
great to have him back in Korea regardless of Team obviously it makes so much sense that he is back on gen G this
44:37
is this has been his team since the Samsung Galaxy days I mean that he's right back where he belongs that was
44:43
very sad when we lost him he did his little stint in LPL didn't quite work out as he had planned and so he's back
44:51
and looking to write a new story here Atlas actually made a great Point as well with him next to Duro is that ruler
44:57
is great he's very vocal he can lead a lane Duro can follow Duro can listen he
45:03
is a very charismatic player in his own right but I feel like he will listen to the right guy and ruler's the right guy
45:09
yeah and you know obviously R had a lot of success with jdg couldn't finish out the year that they had in 2023 H denied
45:16
by T1 as we remember uh but 2024 little bit more unfortunate didn't manage to make whe one game away in the regional
45:22
qualifies in the LPL for making world so missed out there definitely a more disappoint poin ing year than 2023 even
45:28
though they were so close to having an all for 2023 2024 was a bit lower so you know he's coming back to Career he said
45:34
he wants to be on geneng if he's coming back to ltk and he wants to win well he'll be looking for
45:40
potentially his first win here tonight gen G getting side selection they select the blue side which has been the more
45:47
Winning Side uh here at the lck basically ever it's just the way it is
45:53
right like a Legends blue side those two go hand in hands and we've had some fun drafts if you guys haven't been paying
45:59
too much attention you know halay for gingi are your favorite team you're tuning in for the first time it's
46:04
totally Fearless drafting here the bans they don't stick but anything you play
46:10
it gets banned for the rest of the series so we've had 20 Champs bans for
46:15
every series so far because every series has gone to game three and you know I feel like that F ban the Y is like the easiest ban against H Le ever because
46:22
both Z and Zas are so good at this we've seen the tanks targeted gen uh Kean was
46:27
even willing to play Cante in a full fun match which just shows uh how dedicated
46:33
he is to the pick varus and V make a lot of sense those are two of the highest uh ban percentage Champions and the thing
46:40
with the hard Fearless is your bands don't need a flex as much because the things they've just played aren't
46:46
allowed to be picked anymore so these power picks we see Bann here we'll likely see those band sort of carry through the
46:52
series uh Ash still open available K is still open available that will be banned away so they do have the option to lean
46:58
towards something like the ash there's still things like the ambessa the rumble uh some of the picks that we've seen
47:04
first uh Aurora as well also a decent pick for Gen as they are willing to flex it we see what they have to go for as
47:12
his first pick yeah I I think the Aurora is a good shout but you see that rulers talking a lot and with the ash available
47:19
and a lot of different choices that you can pair with the ash not just in the lane but also with Sani still available
47:26
it does feel like a very nice first pick get a TFT F comp you know exactly get
47:31
that going you got trundle in there he's very popular no he's not but he was in the Cinematic getting killed by darus
47:39
Darius but he was there present um does make me wonder if H Le want to
47:45
prioritize like we've seen the ambassa be pretty effective they are looking towards the corki though see a decent amount of the Cori in the bot Lane
47:51
definitely still playable mid and definitely something that Zea was comfortable on when it moved to that ad quy had some mishaps when it was the AP
47:58
poke we don't talk about that anymore um yeah see what H opt to go and looking
48:04
towards the nidle we have seen the Cory nidy as a duo in the mid jungle doesn't
48:09
inspire a huge amount of Joy so you definitely want set up elsewhere Zyra though uh we've seen that have some pretty good success especially if the
48:15
team does try to play more dive oriented you can deal with that quite effectively um but can be vulnerable to
48:21
things like an ash like if you remember uh way back in the day when we had like the MF support Ash carry it was
48:27
specifically cuz the ashh aled the Zyra and then MF Ed so you know a little bit different if you had the nly here you can Ash Al into Spear and just kind of
48:34
delete the Zyra from a distance looks like Canyon might be going towards that NY will lock it in definitely a comfort
48:40
pick for him yeah and we saw yesterday game one DK versus T1 DK pulled out this
48:45
very juicy poke comp they win naly they win Jace they win Ezreal no Ezreal in
48:51
this game obviously with the ash but it's it's kind of interesting to see NY kind of rise the rank here in the jungle
48:58
and sedani kind of get totally ignored so far yeah I really like Leona into Zyra specifically cuz if you play
49:04
something like aliser or re you have to get into Melly range of the Zyra but you can just throw your ult out from a
49:11
distance I think that longer range less committ engage is good you can just kill the Zyra before you actually have to get
49:17
up close and into the potential ult seeing some options being hovered here for the side of HD going to go for the
49:23
Caitlyn in this situation so wanting to kind of match that range of the Ash has
49:28
um but obviously you know we did have a Caitlin game where it didn't really come together too well want to find momentum
49:34
on that champ I feel like more than anything yeah especially because you
49:39
know with Lane swaps and everything it just feels like you're not really getting a lot of the Ling power that the
49:44
pick has it's uh obviously it's it's still got its own uh bits of power but I
49:51
haven't been too impressed by it so far let's say the J is going to come out as a ban you know they saw yesterday Jason
49:57
NY just uh a lot of poke damage that was more of a beat down so he didn't even
50:02
really get to see the Poke comp really get fleshed out too much but yeah there's also I mean there's a tank Jace we've always seen like the Brer Jace um
50:10
with like the Black Cleaver span he's having like a million health and you get the free resistances from the hammer
50:16
form do you see the Ra band away from Delight which I think makes a lot of sense for him as a player definitely a
50:22
pick he's being very comfortable on could even see like the Alistar Band Away pretty into Leona uh and something
50:29
I mean obviously you know we often see Caitlin p with rain supports but generally Delight does lean more towards
50:35
the melees and the air will be denied from chovy here uh so bdd had a pretty
50:41
fantastic game on that uh just the other day yeah I mean to Zer also very deadly
50:48
I I think it's a pretty interesting spot to ban it I don't know if you're really
50:54
wanting to go for air n also you know there's not a lot of dive to try to get on the ash for the azir to
51:01
protect her from that kind of dive um so kind of an interesting one maybe just a
51:07
Target against chovi as the ambessa has been left up throughout this entire band
51:12
phase yep and especially with Cante taking off the cards so King doesn't have that to answer we'll see what he
51:17
does opt to go for into that Essa really strong we've seen uh pretty much a monster in team fights and particularly
51:24
when you just picked up Z for your roster you feeling good about getting him a pick like ambessa I tell you
51:30
that yeah it's a good pickup but it does mean that Keen with the counter pick
51:36
here looking at Renekton I mean this comp feels super centered around set up for the nly I
51:43
mean if you're going to play in Nal this is the sort of composition you want to have where like you have multiple lanes that can set up the spears to land
51:49
comfortably question is what are you going to take mid lane I think the way I think makes decent amount of sense like
51:54
you have that CC already you have that set up like the mid jungle strength isn't really there but you're assuming you're playing into I mean you're
52:00
playing into a Cory so you're not that worried about it uh and it does mean once you start connecting with that
52:05
longer range CC like if you land an ash Arrow the way the H can easily follow up you have that bit of extra poke so I
52:12
think it makes sense for what geni has drafted but this game is very much going to be about Canyon it's h kind of feast
52:18
of famine on him and the light Ops to go for The Bard something we have seen him play a little bit last year and not
52:24
going for those melee supports going to have some bit more range pressure in the lane H and also very effective against
52:30
things like qu and the Ash with that longer range ult for picking them yeah I think the pick uh fits you
52:37
know with the lane with the setup here on their draft but yeah they've kind of
52:44
just got ambessa to run in and everybody else is going to be looking to keep them at range whereas you know you've got
52:50
Renekton naly as you mentioned the way really does shine when there's a lot of
52:56
in the comp already with the Ashley Ona and the rton I'm kind of liking what we're seeing from the side of gen so far
53:03
but we'll see how the game actually plays out I think if you're going to trust a player with n I think Canyon is the one to trust and you've given the
53:09
tools to the rest of the team to set it up so I think there's a lot of potential there but you know if you see things go
53:14
a little bit a Miss if NY falls behind you are up against a Zyra he can also clear pretty fast you have the B you can
53:20
get up to some Shenanigans so uh if the trajectory for geni is consistent they
53:25
they should be pretty fa in this game but you know things can obviously go a bit a Miss quite
53:32
easily you see there are fans out there that have signs that are cheering for a specific group of the lck cup they're
53:39
like no group Elders the best group it's kind of cool to see it all come together
53:44
you know cheering for five teams at once essentially and uh also hoping that your
53:49
team that you en Joy is in that group that's winning more and so far group Elder is winning more so uh we'll see if
53:56
ji can get the win tonight and continue with that or will H life Esports be able to turn the tides let's jump on the rift
54:02
for game
54:15
one oh yeah here we go game number one yesterday if you were watching DK versus
54:22
uh T1 unfortunately you got to witness Barrel
54:28
um For Better or For Worse witness Barrel yeah we witnessed him he shout he
54:34
screamed it as he was running into the enemy jungle and got his ad carry killed
54:39
but it's okay cuz they won that game very single-handed uh very one-sidedly I
54:45
should say I do like the invade we've seen invades for vision but also against a Zyra you deny her early plants and it
54:51
will slow down her early clear a little bit just by clearing those out which he wants to stack up from a pass so I think
54:57
gen definitely benefiting from that we're seeing they all run mid and then kind of decide late where they're going
55:03
uh we do see it's going to end up Lanes on the opposite side were locked into
55:10
now uh so I think honestly I think probably H are happy
55:18
with this you know the re n not going to be able to pair up as much early so I think they can be
55:24
pretty uh okay with how this has turned out obviously a lot of information was kind of uh tried to be found with those
55:31
Wards but when you kind of walk towards mid then just split it's it's really hard to know until the last second where
55:37
you're going to end up against yeah both top laners just going to be zoned out this is the way this
55:42
works I am very excited to have ruler back in the lck um he was doing great
55:48
things in the LPL with jdg didn't quite lead to a World's title but obviously
55:55
everything else um was secured by the team and I think he should be very proud of what he was able to accomplish over
56:01
there you know moving regions and obviously he was also surrounded by a bunch of great players on his on his
56:07
team himself included and now he's just able to you know return and I I'm just
56:13
excited to really see what the rest of his career looks like cuz he's been around for a very long time I think people underestimate how difficult it is
56:19
to go to a different region and still be on like an absolute top team like even just having success some players
56:25
struggle with with but to be on like one of the best teams one the best runs the LPL has ever seen is just shows the Cali
56:32
player uh really that he is and obviously 2024 didn't quite H go as well for him but I don't really attribute
56:38
that to him um and now I think this is definitely the sort of roster where you can look for that continued success uh
56:46
unfortunately not going to see the 22s in the bot L I also think it's funny that like H Le of sign Z that's the biggest signing of the offseason and
56:52
he's like nice time to show what oh I'm I'm Lane swapped on again yeah fun times
56:57
I was definitely worried about this when I heard about a lot of the rift changes and you know the the way that objectives
57:05
work and the fact that first Tower is a feet of strength I was like oh boy I mean we've we're getting Lan swaps it's
57:12
just a thing and peanut never changes uh even with the increased damage ooh very nice flash away from the vines peut
57:19
takes a massive shot big dive on the bottom side as well fighting for First Blood who's going to get it first this
57:25
dive is not going to work though dur nearly dies and Kee will go down and that'll be first Blood here for halalay
57:30
sports gen they want at least the kill will they get it yeah no they will not
57:36
they will not get the kill and duro goes down the spear lands that's too low they
57:42
can't and Z just laughs in their face and I feel like this is the hall Mark of Z and Lane SWS oh he's looking for more
57:49
oh man and ruler with barrier so close so incredibly close testing the limits
57:56
this I mean z this was the Hallmark of him last year in these Lan stop situations taking the fights out playing
58:02
and this is huge for H life Esports not only do they get the kill on the top side they're able to turn it around here and there was a little mistake here
58:08
where peut still end up having aggro from his plant the tower damage Stacks up so quickly and the ramping lasts so
58:14
long you really have to be careful Pina gets Agro again there nearly goes down so a bit of a flob The Flash saves him
58:22
but because it's three range Champions they can be very non-committal with the redive and then here from Z we got to
58:28
see his point of view this was the redive they went for uh and unfortunately jro ends up going
58:38
down he said I'm okay I live I was going to say like he didn't say anything until that very last moment he's chilled out I
58:44
think the flash in the first dive was really good when he dodged the E from jro that really slow down the pace of
58:49
the dive but just some excellent play we're so so early in this game we're already sort of seeing the skill
58:55
expression come out and H demonstrating what they can do yeah this must have been one of the more uh divisive
59:04
prediction uh matches we have this week right who did who did you go for in this one do you remember I went for H I did
59:10
go for H le as well um I think a lot of I think everyone but I can't remember
59:16
one person went geni on the global side I think it was more balanced on the Korean side um which it's domestic gen I
59:24
think that completely make I think both predictions completely valid um if I'm going to be honest uh I know I think I
59:32
was kind of surprised so many people went hle on our side but I also get it cuz I want H yeah I mean at the end of
59:38
the day it's a it's just a prediction you could definitely have reasons for either the teams winning after seeing
59:44
the games play out no it's not just a prediction but I think you remember the summer prediction last year uh that I
59:49
got right and everyone else H didn't get right and that's true it's not just a prediction it's I mean that was a little
59:54
bit different yeah I think if if you're wrong about your predictions it's it's kind of sad um uh you should really just
1:00:00
get better at your job yeah especially for finals yeah that's the only one that matters cuz uh that's where you really
1:00:06
should be focused and if you get that wrong I mean what are you even doing yeah like M won the predictions the for
1:00:12
like summer and then I just got the final one right and it's like that's what people remember everybody forgot about him winning summer yeah which is
1:00:18
good cuz ma he loves to he loves to talk about his predictions he's very he does yeah cares so much about I mean it's
1:00:25
fair you know it is very important as you were mentioning yeah yeah um but yeah no I feel like this is like 55 45
1:00:32
right and I just kind of went for the 55 I I didn't go for the 45 I'm I'm sure
1:00:37
some people might think geni have the 55 per Center which is fair but I personally did not believe so um for us
1:00:45
Tom life Esports just on paper looks like the most solid Squad coming in to
1:00:52
the beginning of this one especially because they kept four players together and they have you know potentially the
1:00:57
best top laner in the lck right yeah I I think for me one of the things is that like you know I I think support jungle
1:01:04
Synergy is really important I think that's something with that peanut and Delight I think they their Synergy is
1:01:09
really good they've been together such a long time and I think Juro and Canyon I
1:01:14
expect them to need some time to sync up I don't think you know the dive obviously didn't work out uh flawlessly I don't think I'm really pinning that on
1:01:20
anyone um it it was some great play from Z but but ultimately I think that that's a big change your systems and just
1:01:27
subbing out a top laner um so but I'm I'm sure they'll be able to figure
1:01:32
things out later we see Canyon did manage to secure three grubs and trade for the dragon so each team has one in
1:01:39
terms of those uh fut objectives for the fat of strength and H obviously have
1:01:44
that Fierce blood so they are ahead in that regard yeah they got their Fe of
1:01:50
strength and Keen finally getting some time to Lane against the champion he
1:01:55
probably wanted to Lane against you know having counter pick with the Renekton the Renekton also as a pick generally
1:02:01
should be pretty good in the S Side Lane as CH is just going to ult Zea just for safety to get away but yeah you're also
1:02:08
picking Renekton as I was saying to just you know survive in a sideline unfortunately he just got Doon a bit too
1:02:14
hard wasn't able to handle it but yeah should be happy with the match up there I mean I think H considering you have
1:02:22
you know even set in the Jungle Top Lane you w really able to make something happen early like you ideally want to be
1:02:28
applying the pressure when Manton uh sort of set up the nly level three is like such a a strong point uh and now
1:02:35
like Z has the ult as an escape tool I think he's kind of getting to the point where he's less concerned about that
1:02:41
threat so we talked about how geni needed to find that early momentum kind of maintain that progression it's not like the game's over or anything they
1:02:47
still have a lot of potential to do that but definitely not the start they they were looking for with this p and we
1:02:52
haven't seen that much from canyon yet in this game I think if it does just turn into a Farm Fest I think H will be
1:02:58
very happy yeah I mean you definitely have a very nice amount of scaling over there
1:03:04
um we'll have to wait and see just how much chy can do on this way because he's farming very well there aren't a lot of
1:03:11
big threats outside of you know like bar lining and ALT and you've got ambessa with a flank or something like that if
1:03:17
he can just kind of keep his distance I feel like that way last pick on blue side for him as you were mentioning was
1:03:23
very nice he's got a very nice front line he has a lot of to line up stuff so you know even if it does go late you can
1:03:29
look on paper and say hey the Champions that H life Esports have do scale pretty well but I feel like there's also a lot
1:03:36
of room for geni to make things work in the late game it's still the Troy factor I think it was important for him to have a pick that can really uh pull its
1:03:42
weight in the later stage of the game considering the rest of the comp but uh and still end up being difficult now
1:03:48
we do have the second set of grubs spawning up soon and the dragon's not for 2 minutes so geni already moving
1:03:54
over to look to try and secure the uh and we see peut in the bot side this
1:03:59
could actually end up being a really favorable trade if they can get the tower but it's still quite healthy so uh
1:04:04
they can get a low but I don't think they're going to be able to take it in time and Keen does have teleport if he wants to move back so P will just pick
1:04:10
up some camps he'll get some damage in the bot Lane Tower but it'll be Genji getting six grubs in this game uh which
1:04:17
definitely is a nice treat to pick up yeah really the question is how much use
1:04:22
are they going to get out of it you can see everybody pretty much is up on the top side so they're really trying to get as much use as possible Z goes in Bal is
1:04:30
decent going to catch the Renekton in Dominus so keen and the team just going to have to abandon the dive really what
1:04:36
it does as that TP was interesting but at least pushes them off do not face
1:04:42
check that brush they're all there again bit of an odd TP coming in from Zea
1:04:48
they're going for the redive yeah I mean especially on this one they're just going to line up the CC immediately kill
1:04:54
AOS there's an arrow right into the Bard as well that is a dead Bard as pea
1:04:59
desperately trying to peel for the team but everybody flashes away very nice couple of kills lined up here for Gen
1:05:05
and that Tower is getting dangerously low oh R looking for
1:05:10
Viper yeah really good setup there from gen and you know they obviously burn a lot of resources with the first attempt
1:05:17
from the dive they got the UL from got the UL from Delight that return die very crisp with it and the arrow from ruler
1:05:23
huge impact there so seeing that CC layering come in really deliver when
1:05:28
making these proactive plays with six scrubs as well if you ever pressure a tower like this like hle you may think
1:05:34
oh couldn't they have just cross mapped but with the six grub pressure they know they would lose the race and the
1:05:39
layering of the CC is really good there and the Arrow coming in just Flawless and it's so easy land the arrow the
1:05:45
follow-ups there great disengage as well to get away from peanut combo and easy
1:05:50
as that we now see a gold lead for Gen yeah mean they were down almost 1,000 gold so this this is pretty huge for
1:05:56
them they have you know about 300 in the lead how sports did get that first Drake
1:06:01
but now we've got a another one up and already gen are on two points here in
1:06:07
the objective counter so if they could set up for a dragon take that one down they've already got a low turret you
1:06:12
might be looking at feat of strength here feat of strength here for Gen I mean realistically when you have six grubs every turret's a low turret you
1:06:18
know you just a little bit of time and you can take that out easily see the pressuring Z here and if you look at
1:06:25
where everyone is on the map from Hite they're not really set up for this Dragon right Z is farming the Top Lane
1:06:31
with no TP uh whereas on the other side like Kina is the only member away from this
1:06:36
Dragon he does have that teleport looks like Kina is going to scare them away a little bit but these Lane assignments
1:06:42
from H don't really indicate they're they're happy to stop geni from doing the dragon but they're not really setting up to do it themselves and now
1:06:50
chovy just putting some pressure on Z Tower getting chipped away on
1:06:58
yeah I mean geni really want to take this one down but there is a ward on the
1:07:03
dragon so not really much you can see the Poke that comes out you know I was talking about poke comps earlier on they
1:07:08
do have you know a semi poke comp with a NY and the way and decent amount of CC
1:07:14
to line it up Valkyrie pretty strong ability it's going to get him to safety but they clear everything out they
1:07:21
notice hey h life is just not here so let's just take a free Drake and a three fet of strength completion chy going to
1:07:28
miss some abilities but he's still got his whole team down here and they know that
1:07:34
there's not a lot of support for Z so can continue to pressure that turret plaing just dropped as well so Tower is
1:07:39
even squish here you can see gen trying to help chy apply pressure considering H had that good start had that Fierce
1:07:45
blood it is looking like the feat of strength likely to go over to gen here and yep six scubs they should just be
1:07:50
able to pick this Tower up pretty easily definitely feels like they've regained control of the game uh after
1:07:57
the early hiccup with the div yeah this should be a very back and
1:08:02
forth uh match just considering how close these teams are uh so definitely expecting to have
1:08:12
uh a lot of Swingin in this one I do think that these teams are very clean but I feel like this patch is not very
1:08:18
clean I I think that you know you lose one team fight you lose adakan you lose
1:08:23
Baron you lose your mid inhibitor it's like all of a sudden we were winning guys what happened a lot of that can
1:08:29
happen on this patch I also think there's just so many things which team are still learning about like the power of them and also like the the limits
1:08:36
that you can push adakan is a great example where you know compared to Baron which we've had for so long and yes has
1:08:41
been changed over the years but teams have a very good understanding of like how how tank you need to be how much damage you need to take it down alakan
1:08:47
still relatively new and you kind of be caught off guard you know especially in the situation where gen you know outside
1:08:54
of ruler they don't have that much damage for a neutral objective oh a light looking I mean trying to land a B
1:09:01
on a n yeah you might as well just not even cast it I think there's two great targets uh on ji for the b n is not one
1:09:09
of them um so a little bit ambitious uh from hle trying to look for that play yeah they like trying his best but won't
1:09:15
find it if you're a Bard fan which I personally am you're not exactly feasting so far here at the lck cup I
1:09:23
have to say K's Bard yesterday was I mean he's great at the champ he wasn't great on it yesterday unfortunately
1:09:29
Delight so far hasn't really been able to do much you know he had a decent alt in the top side delay the dive but it is
1:09:36
a difficult champion and also a champion where like the the margins of error are very thin it's not forgiving you know
1:09:43
you put the wrong magical journey your whole team can get wiped right like there's a lot of a lot of pressure not
1:09:48
to bring up kry again you all remember that one from last year where he uh I didn't even have to say it we all
1:09:54
remember one yeah there was that one you know it happens the the player with a B skin one of the best supports LK has
1:10:01
even he can fub so you know it's definitely a high beard of execution now Genji looking towards the heral P are
1:10:09
more in positioning contesters if they want but still doesn't look like they're interested the arrow won't connect just
1:10:15
kind of fishing with that one but Harold plus those six grubs gen have the tools to keep pushing momentum they will lose
1:10:22
his tower on the bot Lane though just as Z is pushing yeah it really does feel like com life ESP Sports after the dive in Top Lane they've they've really
1:10:29
stepped on the brakes and said okay we we are not going to fight over anything we don't want to fight over the infernal
1:10:35
Dres we don't want to fight over the rift Heralds you know we do want to throw a bardal and a n but that was kind
1:10:41
of you know an outlier outside of that they've just been kind of chilling sitting back saying okay we've got Corky
1:10:47
Caitlyn Lake game it's just fishing you know it's just like if something jumps in the fights the hook then CH but
1:10:54
otherwise that kind of just letting things go it is hex Soul so both teams are Dragon a piece so they're still far
1:10:59
away from that but uh obviously a very impactful Soul um if you're able to pick it up but
1:11:05
for quite a long distance away and especially with adakan coming up from 2 and a half minutes how realistic is it
1:11:11
that we get to the hex soul in this game I don't know doesn't seem seem that promising but adak counton 2 minutes
1:11:18
definitely something you could look towards uh and it is going to spawn in
1:11:23
the Top Lane so close towards the Barron
1:11:28
um Baron side of the M yeah and if you you've been playing a
1:11:34
lot of solo queue and you're you're just tuning in today to the lck cup you might be like hey well uh have we seen any
1:11:41
Runa satak cons you know that's my favorite one I love run I see it all the time in Solo que etc etc the answer is
1:11:49
no uh you're not going to see it we haven't seen it and uh me and Atlas the
1:11:55
base zero runis Aon seem a good vote yeah um I mean I I saw the season opener
1:12:01
event and we had like it was something like 37 kills by 20 minutes and it was
1:12:07
vak I'm like we're just never getting it it's not yeah it's weird cuz I played a bunch of solo que and I was getting it
1:12:12
like all the time I know it's solo queue like don't get me wrong but like yeah it oh pl's been so pretty nice for H uh for
1:12:21
geni and the thing is yes you be in the as hour for it we have dragon up in like seconds but you have a lot of ways to
1:12:27
benefit from the lack of cleanse the Leona you're definitely appreciating that one now they looking to pressure
1:12:32
this mid lane Tower they have the herald if they want to throw it down maybe seeing what they can do without the heral first though oh big old it's it's
1:12:40
just the followup isn't really there they're actually engaging RNG did girl Duro go too far is the question but the
1:12:46
Poke that lands on a Pena from so far away is massive and yeah they don't get any kills but so many low health bars
1:12:53
here on the side of horts they kind of have to abon ship as you see Zea maybe looking for something on the left side
1:12:58
the spear going to force peut to not go for a back as flanking
1:13:04
Corky it's not a thing zeka's been having a very weird game so far um and
1:13:10
you know that that one wasn't really his fault but he's just really not able to do anything on the cour key in that position the followup is just not there
1:13:17
and you can tell the H Le know they kind of need to get onto the squishy Target to gen G but it's so difficult like they land the botle but like unless I'm best
1:13:24
is there or like peut or Viper in range to lay the CC nothing really comes from it and Genji's comp has all this poke
1:13:31
has this long range engage and they kind of just melted H to pick up this Dragon
1:13:37
we'll see the replay so you know the old comes out does manage to connect onto two Targets and obviously the one you're
1:13:42
looking at here is chovi but Peanut's not close enough Viper's not close enough to trap and then jio willing the
1:13:49
CH around peina P so close to going down there yeah with the ignite the heal actually saving him from Delight I
1:13:54
believe and this is exactly what we were talking about like even with the Bal Landing the
1:14:00
followup isn't there Z is not really in position to engage and then chovi just gets to do whatever the hell he wants
1:14:06
he's playing way with zero issues like there's no threats at all to him you
1:14:12
know I feel like Champions like nidle and qu it's like skill shot Reliant not when you have CC on the your team you
1:14:19
you just rely on ruler or Juro Keen setting you up but then it's the easiest thing ever uh and I think that that
1:14:25
cohesion is why I think this comp is working out pretty well for Gen so far I mean the gold League's not huge but the
1:14:31
pace of the game and has definitely felt like they've be in control for a while now yeah they definitely have been uh
1:14:37
ever since that play on the top side they've kind of taken every objective we've seen H Esports a little bit
1:14:42
half-heartedly try to save mid turret and look for some barles onto NES and stuff like that but hasn't really been a
1:14:49
full committ from them and uh rer going to pick up the red buff and and we might just go into a
1:14:56
little bit more of a wall state I'm not sure that you know jeni well yeah
1:15:02
they're just not far enough ahead to go for the oton straight up right so even though halay P stars are playing very
1:15:08
passively you know maybe they could set up around the objective and force H to come into them but at the same time they
1:15:14
can't just do it and you know take all that damage and then potentially get poked out by H life so we'll see how
1:15:20
they do handle this objective yeah I will say having the nly when you're doing neutrals does help that's a
1:15:25
be able to heal up any damage that comes through you can see them setting up the control though but I think you're right though you you want to be supremely
1:15:31
confident before you go for an objective like this cuz the goal lead isn't that significant the control may be in their
1:15:36
favor but the throw even just Smite steel could be huge for H here and Genji
1:15:42
have started it up they feel like they've done the homework and now it's on H to try and contest this one yeah
1:15:48
and you don't have to fully commit to to doing this objective the V just shakan doesn't do all that much damage if
1:15:55
you're kiting it pretty well they've got it down to half they are threatening it Z does have a nice angle with the hex
1:16:00
gate behind them and you can see that Chi immediately is worried about that but he's got Keen for that there's the
1:16:06
arrow there's the leono but the ble to come in to try to save peanut can he get away no he just gets rooted and
1:16:12
immediately decimated Canyon goes golden and Will Survive and now it's a 5v4
1:16:18
although Keen is kind of fighting a 1 V one here against Z Z's getting pretty low and he will go down tries to flash
1:16:24
away and can't do it ruler on his as his huge uh Ash that he always loved to play
1:16:31
he's playing it once again here in this game and he wanted blood but you can see H Sports immediately just had to give up
1:16:37
the point this glowless execution from gen G there really just taking that time the CC connects and you see the concept
1:16:44
of composition it's so hard for ayra especially one with no flash to play into this
1:16:49
composition and H try what they can but not able to deny it and adakam will go
1:16:54
over the G we'll see the replay here so once the CC you can tell they're looking
1:16:59
for peanut they know he has flashed this they know he's immobile they get the arrow long range engage followup and the
1:17:05
B stores it but they don't have to get that close a peanut you know the ult comes to but hits no one because they
1:17:11
can easily disengage Canyon uses a great secret arm guard by time in the T he's looking for an angle but ke is just
1:17:18
sitting on him and there's really nothing he can do in this situation and I also want to mention if you look at
1:17:23
ji's health bars one losing a lot of Health it feels like they juggled the health bar uh the health as a resource
1:17:29
very well there yeah they really did I I feel like Keem marking zos is is really what kind
1:17:35
of wins them that fight and also of course the pick with the ash arrow and you know I we see the play we saw life
1:17:42
ESP Sports get ahead early on with the dive but the the more we see these drafts go head to-head it just feels
1:17:48
like gen got so far ahead in the drafting phase Y and you know The Bard
1:17:54
last pick just hasn't really been hitting the mark so far that you know the the AL peanut
1:18:01
was nice but there's only so much that one champ can do it's also I mean the kin has just felt so underwhelming cuz
1:18:06
you know you're not getting like a significant lead in Lane you Ed Canyon who he just healed and immediately mitigate all the damage you going like
1:18:13
collect it into IE so like you need a lot of time before you're really pumping relative U relevant numbers and oh there
1:18:22
it is again I mean M's is available but does it matter is the question peanut doesn't get to play the game he's just
1:18:28
out of there and he says well sorry guys I I did everything I could the light presses M's immediately yeah it means
1:18:35
you don't die and that's about it um that is the only difference uh I do believe he Mills but it wasn't shown up
1:18:42
in the scoreboard so I think that's why it's gone away now cuz we're having some some issues there should be yeah I think
1:18:48
it froze or something um but yeah now geni I mean you have uh the adakam buff so why not just go for the baron Falls a
1:18:55
low it looks scary but mistake that from chovi yeah trying
1:19:01
to get oh Zea what was that he's just going to die maybe it was a bait all
1:19:06
along but they've got revives as okay I mean yeah you got two of them but Delight might go down here as well Keen
1:19:13
thinking about it but n yeah he's just going to get revived and now there's just no mid laner for H ESP Sports you
1:19:20
don't get much from The Kills uh but this is still like a favorable trade in
1:19:25
terms of gold for H the downside is obviously they lost the mid laner so they're not going to have him there to
1:19:30
contest Dragon for Baron I just I don't even know what to say on this um but
1:19:36
like each kill is 100 gold and and a flower so like and you remove the buff so I think H are okay with everything
1:19:43
apart from the the Corky Valkyrie everything but that they're pretty fine with how this panned out yeah I mean
1:19:48
it's it's like best case scenario because yeah you get all of that but you still don't have a mid laner so there's
1:19:54
still a free objective for Gen and now they're on H Tech Soul point so so not ideal uh Z definitely not his best Cory
1:20:02
performance not even his worst to be honest but a bit unfortunate but it does mean they can set up some Vision around
1:20:07
Baron and considering geni got the the buff and didn't get Baron I I think H Le
1:20:13
they're surviving they're holding on I think is what can be said for this situation Delight getting some deeper Vision obviously the bar one of these
1:20:20
picks that can do that more safely but always has to be cautious about the from ruler which has been pretty consistent
1:20:27
so far in this game yeah for rer I mean he hasn't
1:20:34
really had a lot of opportunities to go for the crazy like uh we we had that one
1:20:41
really famous clip of him kiing out like four people on Ash and it was
1:20:46
uh it really just sticks in my mind whenever I think about Ash I think about ruler and vice versa um he hasn't really
1:20:53
had a lot of opportuni to go for the super super flash he plays but he's doing his job presses his gets a good
1:20:59
Target and it's not like he's hitting ambessa or Delight uh you know I will say though you know even though the gold
1:21:05
lead is in favor of gen they are close to Soul in terms of the items if you look across the board hat have some
1:21:11
decent power behind them now uh Z just hit level 16 Viper is getting through like the power trough that the Caitlin
1:21:17
has we did you see a TP from Troy there a heavy commit bot Lane to try and get z z also doesn't have TP hat like okay
1:21:25
it's Baron the clock maybe maybe Zas is calling this from his T1 days I mean it
1:21:30
it's not a bad idea especially cuz Chi isn't there to poke but the issue is you've still gotten Italy so yeah not a
1:21:36
bad idea but now you've kind of just leased the baron for the enemy team who's much stronger than you how about a
1:21:43
Esports you got to get in the pit you have to get a steal here for peanut that's really the only way as Kean is in
1:21:49
that backline he is distracting Z is doing nothing he's just running away they're keeping at leash and they turn
1:21:54
the peanut down goes zeka down goes Z and this is just a massive Slaughter in
1:21:59
favor of gen Viper no longer for this world and that is a just straight up Ace
1:22:06
very clean nobody dies on the side of gen you can see the patience from gen it never felt like they were rushed into
1:22:12
that they knew that they had the advantage they knew they had the pressure and just waiting until the right abilities hit able to punish H for
1:22:20
that Baron start and now remember they have six grubs they can just end here the quickest respawn is going to be
1:22:26
light there's nothing he can do and geneng G will take the first game in the
1:22:31
series yeah just like that a really clean stuff from them you know there was the one dive issue early on and from
1:22:38
there they just tightened it up and it was all their game the entire rest of
1:22:43
the way so really big shout out to them looking very strong and playing well as
1:22:49
a team you know that was one of the things we may be worried about here but right in game one they prove they can do
1:22:55
it as a fiveman unit and particularly considering like jro was like one of the first ones to die in that early dive and
1:23:01
it felt like it just didn't phe him at all you know the whole team kind of came back they knew they were happy in the comp they were confident with it they
1:23:07
knew what they had to do they brought it back and particularly I think we've seen with Fearless I mean obviously this is
1:23:12
game one so it's not come in effect here we've seen sometimes later in the series teams they might have some decent
1:23:17
Champions but the cohesion of the comp doesn't make sense but I really feel like geni came out with a comp where all
1:23:24
the pieces is fit together it made sense you saw what they're trying to do and you saw in the game play they knew what
1:23:29
they were trying to do yeah they absolutely did and I think on the side of H life you you look at their comp
1:23:35
it's it's not too much cohesion you know you've got at least a decent damage profile but you're kind of just sitting
1:23:41
around if you get behind you don't really have a good way to get back in the game even with
1:23:48
delight alting two people even with Z's trying to flank there was always a very easy answer for Gen so they're really
1:23:54
going to have to go back to the drawing board on this one yeah absolutely I think it's just a hard comp to play I didn't see Avenues from the fin a way
1:24:01
back in so you know definitely credit to gen good draft good play for hanai ESP Sports got to go back to the drawn board
1:24:07
absolutely well that was just game one we will be back after a short break we'll have the space we'll be right back
1:24:24
n
1:25:23

I
1:30:33
hello everyone uh welcome to day number three of the lck cup as we are
1:30:38
concluding our first round robin group matches here with hanell life Esports and geneng G as it was geneng G taking
1:30:46
the victory here over Hana life eorts and putting a very very strong hold for
1:30:52
the elder group to be the top group here in the lck cup Deon alongside wolf and W
1:30:58
did also known as wow did right W did cuz it's like wolf W did never mind nice
1:31:05
Tryon didn't like that one still workshopping this one I that one uh guys
1:31:11
this one I think we wanted to talk a lot about the draft here because this was a unique kind of look here for hanw Life
1:31:18
Esports with the way that they played the red side pairing the Zyra not with the ash this time we did I mean hana's
1:31:24
team comp is basically high level comp no one has a easy tool to make it simple
1:31:29
you know uh you need to make uh play around your pressure only and then once you miss that you have to get your
1:31:37
pressure or Vision back it's like it's really hard to get the vision back you know so I think it was really greedy and
1:31:42
also kind of cocky draft by h esport s I think with ji having a pretty good answer to the corki that was face up
1:31:49
early and saying okay it could be bottom Lane but probably not into the ash we already have one the Zyra got locked in
1:31:55
Canyon was like myly can outpace you because we actually have pressure in our lanes we have winning lanes and even with a lane swap situation we can make
1:32:01
the best of this situation even though their dive failed ji were able to utilize pressure on the map so incredibly well early I think that's the
1:32:07
biggest risk in this you got engage problems here for Han life but you can't utilize the Zyra pick unless you have
1:32:12
those strong lanes and they weren't able to draft them yeah also getting to see a little bit of H here first time in the
1:32:18
lck in 2025 and you can see exactly right here how ji's comp runs as they
1:32:24
dive on the top side of the map 10 minutes in I mean at first play it was really weird to give up six grops for no
1:32:31
reason and also they were try to defend this play but when you think about it what can you do as a Bard you're
1:32:37
defending with your ultimate or can you actually land a stun but when you think about the geni side you have tons of
1:32:44
stuns like you have Leona stun renon stun and also you have Ash Arrow from
1:32:50
ruler from the mid lane uh there is so many tool difference between between Han life Esports and ji and that made the
1:32:56
difference on the top side here Han life mean know that giving up this turret means giving up pizza of strength as well so they really want to try to hold
1:33:02
this but after using the B ultimate to help clear the wave they just really don't have any of those tools you're mentioning would need to actually stop
1:33:08
this fall up and more puzzling than this really is like you said giving up the grubs moments before to get plates in
1:33:14
mid and one plate bottom side has gave Genji so much power talk about some of the picks we've actually seen in game
1:33:20
one before Fearless kicks in you can some of the big picks here were taken away like Theon for example we've seen a
1:33:25
lot of Jace but Aurora completely left out here and I think hanwa had a specific plan in mind and jeni has outd
1:33:32
drafted them here we didn't see some of those big pryo piics picked up yeah we were talking about the needid and Zyra
1:33:37
before the desk I think both Champions are doing the exact the same role but
1:33:42
you need a better support you know it doesn't matter what Champion you are you just need a better CC better tank better
1:33:47
front line and then you can do your job now despite losing the Feats of Strength Han life Feast Sports the reigning lck
1:33:53
Champs still in it and had an opportunity here at oton to find a way back on in but ruler just with the plays
1:34:01
with the spacing did a great job and unable to find the flank this time was Z
1:34:06
you can see how desperate Zas is to try to set up a flank here he's blocked out by Keen who's on the super tanky
1:34:11
Renekton and long range engage is something that Jeni's composition has in Spades because they have the arrow they
1:34:16
have the way but most importantly the Leona that follows up on ruler's fantastic arrows so it's just instantly
1:34:22
a dead zire they've got the zonas available here and you just can't win this fight anymore we're also at a
1:34:27
moment in time for H life where Viper is still in his power trough here and they just cannot actually close the gap here
1:34:33
really good positioning from Keen to start things off when then the arrow comes out there was just a zero some game here for Han life uh as you
1:34:40
mentioned I feel like you really cannot play zarra into Ash because you cannot really do something into him because you
1:34:46
are going to get engaged from like ages and also you are playing against Leona you cannot kill Leona or or so you are
1:34:53
getting engaged by Leona as well so it's like I think Jeni's team cup was so much so much better uh compared to H life ESP
1:34:59
Sports yeah and compare that to how this game started it was the dive on the bottom side of the map on zus where he
1:35:05
outplays it and everyone's thinking this is the Hana life that we've been waiting for this is exactly why they get zus and
1:35:12
then it just doesn't really play out that way afterwards with it I mean how I feel is maybe you trust your players too
1:35:18
much you know oh we got zos so we got so many good players so why not just play some greedy team comp you know yeah I
1:35:26
think for me like I predicted Hana win this series and I do still think they likely will that was a really greedy
1:35:32
draft from them they they flued a lot of the macro but it's because their Lanes didn't have pressure I think if they go back to something that's a little bit
1:35:37
more standard if they can have a stronger draft going into game three they can push us to game or game two they can push us to game three that is
1:35:44
to say remember in the lck cup format you got to be on the winning group and
1:35:49
group Elder already up 3 to one geneng on group Elder they could make it four
1:35:55
to one and they've already gone best vers best you know second team vers second team third team vers third team this could be a huge huge hold here what
1:36:03
does Han life need to do to bounce back here wolf in terms of this draft and what do you want to see here I just want
1:36:08
to see picking for pry a little bit here playing towards your player strengths a little bit obviously zeka is known for
1:36:14
playing corki since the rework but in this game just didn't give himself a whole lot of agency they have blue side
1:36:19
here blue side by the way we've had a lot of game threes is 11 and two so so far so a lot of winning blue sides
1:36:27
across these games all right well we'll find out if hun life Sports will be able
1:36:32
to battle back not just for themselves but everyone on group Baron or will group Elder take a huge huge lead here
1:36:39
after the first set of matches let's find out as we send it back on over to the casters thank you spacers I had a I had
1:36:45
a feeling blue side was winning a lot thank you wolf for that very apt very
1:36:51
important stat uh blue side is quite the strong side right now I feel like blue
1:36:57
blue side was already strong prior to this but now with feis it's like imagine you're Banning more and more
1:37:03
Champions sorry to interrupt you but this is a kbo player from the Hana
1:37:09
Eagles the if you don't know what kbo is it's the Korean baseball organization uh I believe and um yeah
1:37:17
he's a baseball player that's very cool he's come down to support hanwa and he's also a great dancer
1:37:24
putting the moves in love to see H Elite definitely need that support right now to bounce back in this series but yeah I
1:37:31
was saying it's like blue side was already op and now with FIS you have extra Champions Bann so blue side is the
1:37:38
team who get the priority to choose after the fact to like you know if there's a bunch of picks off the table
1:37:43
they start Banning away junglers when loads of junglers are gone like they still get a fierce pick the jungler they have that Advantage it definitely feels
1:37:49
like it's skewed even more in the favor of blue side but now H Le in that position you can see at the top of your
1:37:55
screen the picks that are not enabled uh and bans first I feel like
1:38:00
bans not as likely to change cuz obviously everything you didn't want to deal with from last game is gone uh
1:38:06
cassant going to get taken away scarner ban from geneng G poppy from uh
1:38:13
H I think the Y ban is going to be pretty constant I don't think they're going to get to play it once actually
1:38:21
right now VI and kalista both left open kiston by F pick especially with poppy
1:38:27
band from hle I feel like it' make sense to just take that one when one of the things
1:38:33
they were kind of struggling with was getting onto the key targets Vai literally just does that that is her kit
1:38:40
so uh it would make sense to lock that one in that's not Vai that's actually really install that is looks so similar
1:38:47
though I I couldn't tell got them mixed up yeah this makes so much sense uh Jace
1:38:54
was banned in game one in the second round of bans but Jason General has as
1:39:00
you mentioned in game one he has a lot of flexibility now even play him mid we
1:39:05
saw showmaker have a huge game on that in game one against T1 um that was along with a lot of poke uh you can play him
1:39:12
top you can play him tank you can play him Bruiser we'll see if Keane wants to do that but for now it will be a flex
1:39:19
pick and just a strong pick in the meta right now that you can really build around in many different ways yeah so
1:39:27
with that locked in probably don't want to pick another solo ler just to keep that kind of open as a flex Sani sedani
1:39:33
yeah is uh the golden standard for lck teams just just lock it
1:39:40
in or this look at a different direction I'm going to go for the Z out which has seen a lot more popularity recently bit
1:39:46
of skirmishing power on that and you know we've seen some picks like brand or
1:39:51
Zyra give it a bit of trouble in the early game with already known the jungle match up you're you're kind of happy with that
1:39:56
one uh now over to H they do want to pick something in response to that J
1:40:02
they are looking at the Aurora which you know was talked about on the desk is kind of being overlooked particularly
1:40:08
with the vi makes things really difficult and also if you are worried about maybe like a z coming out later for Gen I feel like Z really struggles
1:40:15
into Aurora because you can't get out of a r with your Ro you still have to really be in Flash um gives a lot of
1:40:22
power and the raan for Del light H can definitely layer well with the vi and a
1:40:27
pick he is very comfortable on does have some Lanes of struggles to generate pressure but ever since they buffed his
1:40:33
Q heal he's he's pretty good at weathering the storm yeah I was very excited to see chovi and Fearless
1:40:40
because it it just feels like he is a guy who can play anything and it's not
1:40:45
just mid Champs like he can play any mid champ that's kind of standard but he can also Play tanks to an extremely high
1:40:52
level so it just feels like you know you want to put him on the Jace you want to put him on the Gallo you can essentially
1:40:57
do whatever you want with this player so much flexibility this could be a flex though the Gallo um Gallo used to be I
1:41:04
mean one when he first came in a support role he was really strong when he could uh flash while taunting but when they
1:41:10
changed that and he kind of dipped out sportall you'd still occasionally see him as a raan counter just cuz when he
1:41:15
kind of dashes in you can interrupt his dashes with your uh punch and also you can just channel the taunt you know the mobility of raan kind of struggles into
1:41:22
a big AOE area where you're guaranteed to get CCD in so could be a flex we don't know for sure yet and I feel like
1:41:29
with the Gallo potentially being a flex and the J being a flex geni really keeping their options open we do see
1:41:34
that Z Bann away from H so despite the fact they have the Aurora they want their VI to connect onto
1:41:41
ruler yeah they definitely do um I think Zia we've seen it a lot with veran it's
1:41:46
been very underwhelming I I think there are a lot of things that do well into it especially if you can stack a lot of CC
1:41:52
as well you can press feather storm for one but then not for the other three right um but with all these 80 carries
1:41:59
now banned away what is ruler going to play we did see Jinx yesterday for aiming is ruler playing Jinx straight up
1:42:07
here in game two yes he is I'm going to be honest you know we have already 280 carries taken away from Fearless 6 80
1:42:13
carry bands here and you may be thinking oh they'll be struggling but I think of any 80 carries I think Viper R are
1:42:19
pretty okay they they've played everything uh they really canest that pools I mean the Jinx in
1:42:25
particular when we think about the 2023 MSI run from jdg the Jinx was the pick
1:42:30
for ruler so a big comfort for him do you see the Tristana come out from H ali
1:42:36
um which could be bought could be flexed up the mid as well Zack obviously had a lot of success on that pick um last year
1:42:42
so we'll see what they opt to do here if they do go for that TR in the mid lane could go for like a zigs in the bot Lane
1:42:48
as would provide the ad especially with the layer CC from the V could follow up on that and but it could also be like
1:42:54
could be like trispot and Aurora mid a lot of flexibility in these drafts looks like they're going going to potentially
1:43:00
go for that I mean in theory you could also go roora bot but I expect it in the mid
1:43:05
lane and then we have uh the on Top Lane for Z something we did see him bring out a little bit last year but a lot of
1:43:11
engage if that's something they lacked in the last game we saw Z trying to get the flanks and they not really working
1:43:17
they now have everything they need to lock down a stationary Target which that Jinx is and and J going to go for the
1:43:23
Lulu which is a very comfortable Lane of the raan um going to have pressure going
1:43:29
to struggle to really force them out of Lane because of the sustain from the raan but you will always have pressure
1:43:34
on that lane and also you can really deal with raan well like your wild growth can interrupt his grand entrance
1:43:41
um so it kind of feels like gen are all in on the ruler carry and kind of
1:43:46
playing around the uh the gallo and the the Zin peeling for that Jinx and H or
1:43:53
like let's kill ruler that is their plan in a nutshell yeah I think that's very
1:43:59
fair I think that both teams have done a pretty good job of going into those
1:44:05
ideas and really flushing it out as it went through the or you know it's it's
1:44:10
very interesting to have zus join the team and then he's playing or in game two but it really does kind of work with the draft I'm not sure where orn is in
1:44:17
General on this patch as that's another by the way H Eagles jersey and there's
1:44:23
one of the players from the hanwa Eagles uh once again joining us here
1:44:29
from the baseball team of hanwa showing their support getting married
1:44:36
tomorrow and she wants a gengi victory as her gift her wedding
1:44:42
gift a lot of multi there's a lot of stress go that goes into preparing a marriage I'll tell you that will LC it's
1:44:50
it's an easier request than some of the other teams like a geni win not that big of an ask if you're going to be honest in absolutely well here's game two let's
1:45:10
go I feel like a really big test of relationship would be if like last year you were a bro fan and you like you will
1:45:16
get married after bro in and you're waiting for weeks you know like can we stall it out with the venue and like
1:45:22
that's how this works I just but bro really has to win that's so do a
1:45:29
win yeah they haven't won the last
1:45:35
15 well geni with a very strong invade here actually as a fiveman unit moving
1:45:41
in even Keen going as far as toward the bottom Lane to spot for the swap of
1:45:47
course which does seem to be yeah I think the swap H are happy
1:45:54
with geni want normal Lanes they're going to have pressure in both those side lanes and ultimately you know I
1:45:59
think H when you think about the 5v5 when you think about the team fight a lot of strength there don't uh goes without saying a lot of tools to connect
1:46:06
on a ruler but we're in a situation where you have a Gallo who can kind of just one shot waves later and Roam and
1:46:11
you have a Jace who should have pressure in the Sid Lane you have Jinx Lulu into
1:46:17
trist raan that is a brutal Lane for the Trist raan in terms of you're always going to be shov in so H I think getting
1:46:25
this switch definitely good you can see Z just trying to get an XP range uh and
1:46:30
I think you know Z despite being a younger player we've seen players who've been around in the swap meta I think
1:46:36
he's really been locked in and understanding the goal of a top laner when you're in a swap just get as much
1:46:41
xp as possible sometimes it will cost you your life and that's okay cuz it's better than being level one for like 15
1:46:48
minutes uh which we have seen from time to time from players who did not prioritize that exact thing you were
1:46:55
talking about um nowadays Dives a lot less common yeah
1:47:02
but yeah this this isn't really the lane to go for it but he is level three and he's got red buff normally last year
1:47:09
there' be a Canon minion now and there isn't because of the minion changes so he needs to get level two he does get it
1:47:16
yeah I mean I I I'm not sure about this one also Delight is here and ruler took a turret shot can I mean he almost took
1:47:23
another one so yeah I I was really not
1:47:29
on board with this from the Geto but also delight's timing was very nice Y and geni are going to pull out of that
1:47:36
one good roam down from Delight Z also gets XP you don't have the cannon in and there's more damage minions oh yeah good
1:47:44
work from te just disengaging
1:47:50
that yeah near levels playing melee into aora not fun see that more on Top Lane
1:47:55
but Gallo just one of these Champions who kind of just Spam abilities in the way oh look at this the or raon Lane
1:48:02
trying to make something happen and they're going to pay for it walks on top of the Chompers and gives rulers Jinx
1:48:09
First Blood it could not have gone any worse for them I'm just not sure what they thought would happen in that
1:48:15
situation um yeah especially you into a lethal Tempo Jinx they have barrier heal
1:48:22
whereas you have uh uh okay Keen limit
1:48:27
testing a little bit there uh into the ad carry but he doesn't die uh unlike theight who gave a kill over the ruler
1:48:34
on Jinx with a Lulu to back him up and one of the best front lines we've
1:48:40
seen from a mid jungle duo in a long time so yeah a lot of tools you know we
1:48:45
talked about Wing conditions in the draft you did Ox uh I feel like gen were just given like a little extra gift on
1:48:53
top of that they're like how can we win our win condition even stronger let's give ruler First
1:48:58
Blood okay so I I want to make it clear Delight is level two and he has q and W
1:49:04
but not e e being you know you know the ability that you Ed to get out again after you
1:49:10
engage um yeah raon level three is a pretty big spike I really feel like you
1:49:15
can't do as much until you're level three because yeah you go in and then you come out again and I think that's
1:49:21
the kid you know Delight notoriously an extremely good Recon player but maybe just feeling himself a bit too much cuz
1:49:27
that play was just not it and rer played it really well the traps to kind of cut him off right at the end uh to secure
1:49:33
that kill yeah and now Delight still level two uh
1:49:38
Viper level four but presumably yeah he's nearly level five so he's ahead in XP compared to ruler but uh the light is
1:49:45
really far behind now so he needs to soak some XP quickly but this Lane even if you get XP you know you don't have
1:49:52
ignite uh for hat you don't have summons in general um that many it's really hard to
1:49:57
have pressure in this Lane and you can kind of see if you look at the map Top Lane shoving in pretty heavily bot Lane
1:50:03
shoving in pretty heavily uh and mid lane is just chilling so this is kind of you know Jeni's wi condition is just
1:50:10
having that pressure in lanes and allow and being able to flourish from that yeah should work pretty well I I
1:50:17
think the biggest thing from this draft that I kind of scratch my head at on the side of pal life is Sports was the Trana
1:50:24
I feel like uh maybe to go a little bit more meta something that can follow up uh on team fights on VI engages would
1:50:30
have been something like a Zer right but I I think they were very worried about maybe having to deal with this Jinx Lulu
1:50:36
Lane and they wanted something that could eventually uh maybe match in terms of range but yeah so far it just feels
1:50:43
like it maybe wonder if like they were trying to pick it cuz it was a potential Flex like compared to other picks but
1:50:49
I'm just like he play very mid I mean true but yeah it it did feel a bit odd
1:50:54
but we're seeing a setup for the grubs now H have learned from last game don't give six grubs to the other team can
1:51:00
might have to flash yeah I mean he's not level six so just in the pit and then he's out of
1:51:05
the pit but kind of catching them here a bit of damage already from ruler they're trying to turn on a chi quick uh charm
1:51:12
do come down Viper jumping in they want to get the reset on ruler and they might just be able to do so Viper finally gets
1:51:19
it but Peanut's going to go down so there's the trade durl On The Run should eventually be taken out but looking for
1:51:25
the grubs here is Gen and maybe a bit more Z trying to stick around fper has
1:51:31
survived but I don't think I'm going to be able to say the same about Z he will be taken down and they give the kill
1:51:36
over to the Shao so just like that a couple of grubs and yeah they got ruler
1:51:42
they did take him down but the fight did still go in the hands of ji yeah ear indicator of how team fights are going
1:51:48
to be very difficult for Viper does have backup and penis it should be okay here here but uh yeah early indicated of how
1:51:55
team fights are going to be difficult for ruler uh but at this point of the game the other pieces from gen can do
1:52:00
plenty and one of the problems here is they just didn't really lock down ruler that quickly and then Juro just kind of
1:52:07
just did a lot of running he was the Running Man in that one uh where we see initially they see ruler step up and Z
1:52:14
is like okay it's go time they pop everything ruler doesn't end up flashing the CC and then ends up going down to
1:52:21
the bomb and then they're chasing Duro and he's just running and he's buying time uh as the rest of the team kind of
1:52:27
do the the grubs uh yeah and then Z just ends up a little
1:52:32
bit overextended so you know I I don't think either team too disappointed with how
1:52:38
this planned out but I think those Summoners for ruler are going to feel
1:52:43
it's going to feel like he's just using them more cool down if uh H are playing correctly in this one yeah just throw
1:52:48
everything into the Jinx and get those things off cool down or on cool down and uh you're
1:52:56
going to be feeling pretty good about the way it goes not a whole lot of other threats but um you know at least it does
1:53:03
look like uh Keen should be going a damage type build in this one canyon in
1:53:10
the brush and Delight might just face check up but here comes peanut chovi remember
1:53:17
he's Gallo he does have TP but no alt and he's still in the mid lane meanwhile
1:53:22
Keen he's chased and what he does against or in this matchup is you try to ignore the or as much as possible and
1:53:28
get turret plates y already got two yep two grubs coming in early definitely
1:53:33
helping out with that damage on Towers so the gold lead in The Top Lane already is massive like although zos was picking
1:53:40
up a lot of farm in uh sorry not a lot of farm a lot of experience from the farm he wasn't actually getting the Cs
1:53:46
and he's really poor and Far Behind uh they have found Canyon yeah I mean they do he has his alt up but
1:53:54
that's a v loves that very much gets inside the circle Canyon smites away the blue and then just dies so heut will
1:54:01
secure that one for himself yeah good pick um but still a lot of Vols expended
1:54:07
a lot of high value SS with z and peut b and there so definitely want to be B
1:54:13
those of cool down and chain things together Z does get challenge by chovi and chovi
1:54:18
starting to get quite tanky we are seeing that more tanky Gallo build coming out so not in enough itself going
1:54:24
to be a huge damage threat kind of relying on the team for that one H and that also kind of comes into the feat of
1:54:30
strength thing because when you have this tankier Gallo your magic damage is kind of underwhelming you know the rest
1:54:36
of your team is AD the boots the upgraded ninja Tabby give that physical
1:54:41
damage Shield specifically so if you lose feature strength and your damage profile is bad you're going to feel even
1:54:47
worse about it so it's definitely something ji will want to prioritize and with that Dragon pick from hle um
1:54:54
they're still behind in terms of feature strength pression progression because of the F blood but uh ahead in terms of those neutral
1:55:02
objectives yeah they got the one they got the dragon they got one grub at this
1:55:07
point in time and uh so far it's been an interesting look we've had a lot of uh
1:55:13
kind of crazy somewhat messy games that go longer or very short uh so far here
1:55:19
at the lck cup but I feel like we're getting a higher level look at what this patch might look like so far it's it's
1:55:26
very similar but it it does feel like it's a little bit more calculated between these two teams on where exactly they want to go for the fights here's
1:55:34
Viper uh weird barrier decision um I think maybe expecting a bit more be from
1:55:42
from Chi um who is tanky but not doing that much damage right now always press
1:55:48
tab yeah yeah maybe you wanted to check those item like oh chovy's on me like okay but it's tank CH I think you're
1:55:53
fine yeah H they do want to try and get a gr up here H to deny deny on the ornh horn Toby in the
1:56:01
front and look at the double knock up there with the zinow and the Lulu just tanking up so much and ruler is totally
1:56:07
safe and he gets the snipe he's excited and he's looking for more that's a kill on the orn and zeka maybe he gets away
1:56:15
here with his Al but that is the saddest alt usage we have seen here in the lck
1:56:21
cup gen there in position and they take down the fight very handily and for a team who are so ult Reliant hle opt into
1:56:28
that before their ults are available and it ends up backfiring massively R has his sus back up didn't end up needing to
1:56:34
expend them there and it just kind of felt like HD were forcing this so you know you can actually track uh Z gets
1:56:42
his ult interrupted peanut doesn't have his ult yet it's not available so he loses all his HP you can see Canyon on
1:56:48
top of him still doesn't have his Al and it only comes up I think about now when he dies also Z didn't have his Al
1:56:55
available you can see it ticking away at the bottom of your screen it just comes available as he uses it so like you know
1:57:00
those are two of your biggest tools for taring the Jinx they weren't there you still opted for the fight and geneng if
1:57:06
you don't shut down ruler they will just run you over yeah I mean geni we said it after game one they look like a fiveman
1:57:13
unit um apparently we didn't all know that uh Doran was the shot caller of p a
1:57:18
sports because it seems like with Doran gone they're just a mess like so far they have not really played very well as
1:57:25
a team and I think that's putting it lightly as now trying to set up something here on to geni but TP is
1:57:32
coming in from the Gallo they're looking to take down Canyon or that's peanut rather and that's just going to be free
1:57:38
as meanwhile a couple of 80 carries going head to-head the barrier though available and he jumps over ruler just
1:57:45
to die H Le getting demolished right now looking for some more pressure here on
1:57:50
AAS and they might just be able to take him down nice knock of su come in and they're tanking that turret but chy is
1:57:57
just so tanky it's unbelievable and yeah that's going to be the end of these two H life Esports who said it gen are just
1:58:06
they are just steamrolling them here this is not very close at all I mean they wanted revenge for the summer
1:58:12
finals and they are getting it right now 2.3k gold lead between AD carries 2.2k
1:58:18
between top laners those are the people you want to have the gold and they have in Spades right now 7,000 gold lead at
1:58:27
14 minutes man so I mean oh I don't want to watch this again you burn barrier
1:58:33
against chovy's damage earlier and yet you still go for this play and you you eat the zap you eat the old the ward too
1:58:40
the insta Ward right on top of I mean rer played it flawlessly credit to him but going for that without the barrier definitely a mistake from Viper and here
1:58:48
like Keen has so much more damage in items than is it's not even I just don't
1:58:54
understand why you're going for this like you saw Canyon at the end and he's like you know what I have to go in and
1:59:00
then Z and Delight are like well we we have to defend the turret apparently allegedly uh great work Kobi here baits
1:59:07
out the uh CC immunity and you can see chovy's tank of the tower this whole time yeah
1:59:13
unfazed uh yeah so some questionable decisions from H for ji just zero
1:59:20
hesitation and you know it it makes sense that they kept that core together and ruler slotted in which is obviously
1:59:27
quite effective but I genuinely thought that having a new support you know going
1:59:32
from uh delight and then lens well lens and Delight then lens uh it would take
1:59:37
longer to accommodate and fit your in but you know they feel like a unit already they really do and you know even
1:59:45
individually Duro extremely confident player you know even said he wants to be
1:59:50
known as the best support player one day I I think that he definitely has a lot of talent and jeni believed in him and
1:59:56
we said at the beginning he's a great match for ruler you know ruler he's the dominant 8 carry who can tell the guy
2:00:01
what to do who's a little bit newer uh in the lck and he's got the talent to do it now
2:00:08
Canyon is going to get isolated here once again the vi does come in but look at that huge Redemption heal and they
2:00:13
just don't have the damage they're finally going to get onto that backline but then giant rocket is going to hit
2:00:19
DEA as well but he is going in so is Viper that's a couple of kills now the ruler looking for something but he's
2:00:25
going up against five people coming in and now you've got a front line for ruler to just go
2:00:32
absolutely insane in this fight seus oh he's looking for peanut actually he's
2:00:37
got it maybe one rocket no not quite but he will absolutely take at least a
2:00:43
triple kill in this one and it was a 3v5 that jji were fighting you know it
2:00:49
looked good for H because rer wasn't there and a second he Ted up it instantly f h look good for HD sorry but
2:00:56
oh peut should be able to kill jro here I think yeah uh well about being a
2:01:01
rookie I mean he's not technically a rookie anymore but uh yeah trying to get
2:01:06
some Wards down some deep WS not expecting peut there a little bit of a oopsy from Duro yeah I mean it's still a
2:01:12
6K lead almost 7K for Gen and I mean that fight it looked good for H because
2:01:17
ruler wasn't there that is specifically why this fight was going okay and even then it wasn't like they were stomping
2:01:24
you know it took so long to kill Canyon Zea gets chunked out pretty heavily but the chock Blast has to flash away and
2:01:30
then dip out oh more action coming through they actually have a lot of armor shred from the vi onto this Gallo
2:01:37
he's still so tanky yeah he's only got like the he doesn't actually have that much armor but still very durable uh
2:01:49
durable yes
2:01:54
I mean you know he's on the team so you have to say it right I'm a dad now so I got to make dad jokes that is true
2:02:00
that's my only strength hon honestly all things is consider you kind of been slacking that the comment yeah
2:02:05
I'm I'm trying to work on it it's not my for he's still a new dad I think everyone at home that's the thing you know I'm like Duro you know I'm I'm I'm
2:02:12
just face checking in The Jungle by myself when I do my dad jok so give me some time I'll work on it you're a Ricky
2:02:17
doad we'll get there yeah
2:02:23
the do see ji trying to force H Eli away here and doing a pretty good job of
2:02:29
it and I feel like this is now just going to be the play around ruler and let him shoot things uh style of play
2:02:35
from ji uh heading up towards top side where they don't currently have a wave but they are just clearing out off oh
2:02:41
the the level 10 on flank okay well that Al's going to hit Canyon that that's not
2:02:48
ruler but maybe Z can land it yeah he's going to be able to land it lurer in a bit of trouble he's got the Recon on him
2:02:54
as well but the knockups are coming in from the Lulu and he has the front line they can't take him down he will win the
2:03:00
fight once again with his team H life Esports overextend and gen man with ruler they
2:03:09
just look like on a whole new level and they were already so good feels like he never left honestly fitting right in
2:03:15
with Gen G the team are playing around him defending him and he's just popping off I think hle I mean gold lead is one
2:03:23
thing but also they just didn't have anyone who did damage hitting ruler so he kind of just tanked the CC the team
2:03:30
peeled and then he turns around and just decimates uh hle over 10,000 gold lead
2:03:36
now they are so far ahead this is a Aon into GG angle you would assume here a
2:03:44
lot used to try to get onto rer the problem is like Z is level 10 he's lower level than ruler the 80 carry and he's
2:03:51
the only one who really has access to him except you have the level seven raan who man oh and look at his health they
2:03:58
nearly get him under half HP wow Viper jumps in uh yeah wait he's got Lulu and barrier
2:04:05
and shield and aalo in front of him you know what I'm going to say even if they were even in Gold that would been a rough fight all right leten their
2:04:16
here hit the front hit the front line okay he's calling for the pent
2:04:24
which is really funny because it got stolen away by
2:04:29
ke I'm not sure if he got four it's only triple
2:04:35
yeah yeah ruler thought he got a Quadra so that's that was the discussion there at the end yeah it was just three but
2:04:43
already game two of the series but match one ruler is calling for a Penta yeah
2:04:50
against h a whole R probably there like wait you lost
2:04:56
these guys all right well you've got the vi this time maybe this is enough I mean to be honest it should be and finally H
2:05:03
P Sports find the angle and now wears the damage on gen I mean you've got a Jace you've got a tank Gallo peanut
2:05:10
taking a bit of damage and they're super far down on gold so ji are still considering taking this fight even
2:05:16
without ruler they say who needs 0 carries in 2025 we just going with our
2:05:22
tank G look at Toby he's just punch by the dash he's just punching them yeah he
2:05:28
stops the dash but he's going for theight instead and will take him down he wants peanut as well but the shield
2:05:34
comes in and you know what that was actually exactly what H needed when they
2:05:39
went 10,000 gold but uh the concept they got the
2:05:45
concept right the execution actually no it was more so they got the execution and the concept right just they didn't
2:05:50
have the finances yeah the timing just a little bit
2:05:56
off yeah like maybees ago we have the goal to kind of
2:06:02
indicate that yeah I mean this is this is how the comp works this how the comp should function uh you press your
2:06:08
buttons on ruler and you kill him it's that simple but you have this Jace who
2:06:13
kind of like a Bruiser Jace has the black lever and the uh oh they're looking to contestan oh the taunt there
2:06:20
on Peanut he's not going to be able to try to get in and yeah that's just Aon
2:06:26
buff and himalai ports they had to do something the Rockets are coming in the zap and the big one will take him down
2:06:33
ruler not messing around and he will be looking for a bit more zeka not long for
2:06:39
this world either as they don't quite have a wave in mid but they've got aacon buff and they have ruler who is now I
2:06:46
believe 12 and one on the jinx this this is an 80 carry you give
2:06:51
him a hyper carry He will carry your team and they drafted a wonderful comp around him it's all looking just
2:06:57
beautiful today Jinx I'm just getting flashbacks from 2023 MSI where he just ran the tournament on this pick honestly
2:07:04
and good luck hle I mean yeah good effort uh it doesn't give you
2:07:12
any points though for doing that maybe they can stop the base from going down but there's five revives available so uh
2:07:19
good luck with that as well Peanut's going to go down not going to have a Penta angle for ruler by the way as he is going to be
2:07:26
revived we got TPS coming this game is over guys T are uh you know a casual
2:07:32
16,000 gold ahead 23 minutes in and they will finally look to end this game after
2:07:39
picking up some extra KDA just just little bonus and there you go Gen absolutely smack down home life Esports
2:07:46
and get their Revenge yeah uh absolutely I think it it
2:07:52
goes without saying and uh you know there was always a wonder I mean the expectation was that you know geni had
2:07:58
ruler for a while they knew how to work with them knew how to play with them but it's been a bit of time away it doesn't feel like that I feel like if you've
2:08:05
been in a coma between when ruler left and now you wouldn't even have realized that he's gone he looked formidable fit
2:08:11
well in with the team and geni we always know they're going to be strong domestically we know that they're they're Titans of the regular season I
2:08:17
mean obviously ltk cups a different format but they the expectation was that
2:08:22
H would the big be their big opponent that this would be a close series and I think they just kind of demonstrated that they're still on point they League
2:08:29
above yeah and after five matches group Elder four wins group Baron has won
2:08:37
group Baron only DM freaks were able to take down Nim that's all they have and
2:08:44
after that all the other group Elder teams have won so they're really setting themselves up here to be in a good spot
2:08:51
to have everybody make it into a great seating for the playoffs can't say the
2:08:57
same about the opposite side but yeah H life Esports there's ruler not going to talk
2:09:03
about H right now as he shows off the geni logo it just feels so right right you know like you were saying it's like
2:09:09
they wasted no time he's right back in the lineup nothing changes he's got a new support that follows him around and
2:09:15
does his job you know it's it's just the ruler show we're we're right back here the lck never changed yeah I mean dur
2:09:22
looks I mean like I feel like the story wasn't really about him but he did his job I think he was serviceable and I
2:09:28
think I obviously I'm hoping to see games where it's more about him like playing Lulu it's less about the individual stuff you do unfortunately
2:09:35
with ruler I don't know how many game like that he's going to have but we'll
2:09:40
see what the meta looks like it's a good start and considering my expectations was we take time to build up this
2:09:45
Synergy between the team support jungle Synergy really important uh J looked fine and I
2:09:52
yeah um that was a head scratcher definitely some head scratchers from on
2:09:57
life Esports uh I wouldn't have thought that just changing your top laner would make this much of a difference but you know you made the the joke about Doran
2:10:04
being the shot call um the loss of Daren uh apparently having some impact here
2:10:11
the loss of Daren is a reason the Viper lost this 1 V one obviously absolutely um but yeah I mean it just felt like
2:10:17
geni was so cool calm and collected even when there were plays that went in favor of hle they just never seemed phased at
2:10:25
any point in this entire series it felt like it was always okay well they might have got a favorable play at this point
2:10:31
let's chin it around let's do this let's do that and most of the time it was just geni getting the favorable plays uh
2:10:36
really a master class of just how to play out these fights and I feel like even the smaller pieces like chovy like
2:10:42
interrupting countless uh the recast on the G Walt he doing his thing on the uh
2:10:50
on in the oral the recast the or do this thing on the Gallo uh just really everyone
2:10:55
playing as as you expect gen to do he's saying he's going to go in he's
2:11:02
going to stop it the or Al in this one saying to hit the
2:11:11
tower try not to lose effect if you uh if you can help it
2:11:21
don't have Jinx oops I died wait and ke just teleports back in
2:11:28
he's like hey guys you guys are fine though without
2:11:33
me see there's a rocket flying across the map as well um but yeah I mean this
2:11:39
is the two comps we saw from jeni as well I feel like especially this one really highlights what jji can do
2:11:48
especially when you've got a guy like toi his champion pool is is it's Champion ocean he can play anything you
2:11:53
need him to play Frontline tank Gallo yeah he's going to do it perfectly for ruler like anybody can carry this
2:12:00
really feels like that team this time and it's just crazy that we had like so many 80 carry bands and realer still
2:12:05
gets Jinx which yeah I mean I feel like the the Jinx for rule is such a huge
2:12:11
pick so the fact that that was still open after so many and uh yeah gasp
2:12:16
shock I I could not have guessed it you know we talked about game one a little
2:12:21
bit you know he wasn't really doing like the crazy Ash gliding or but he didn't have to he he did his job on the arrows
2:12:29
like yeah he had some good arrows the Jinx game though uh really playing it well and yeah I think just good good to
2:12:37
have him back good to have him back this team I don't know if anybody's going to be able to beat them right like if you
2:12:42
look at group Baron we got Dean freaks bro bnk T1 it would have to be T1 I think but
2:12:49
it's a big time I don't oh ji just looks so strong but guys we have the interview ready on stage let's throw it over to
2:12:55
the translation thank you very much guys
2:13:00
this is z for the P interview transation joined by ruler on the side of ji who just got a two Victory
2:13:10
congratulations seeing your congrats on the victory how do you
2:13:16
feel during the match I felt like my heart was about to burst but I think my
2:13:22
teammates did so well so I'm really glad
2:13:28
you did you try to suppress it you know I've never felt this nervous like this before so I was also
2:13:36
quite surprised we were so excited for the
2:13:42
battle of the representatives between group Baron and group Elders so what was the key to today's victory
2:13:51
no aside from me the other teammates had really good shot calls and
2:13:58
every single play making was actually really carried out very well do you think play well today is I
2:14:07
think everyone really play this is your first match with
2:14:16
Duro first of all I think it's a little too early to say about our Synergy or
2:14:22
teammates I think because you don't really get to do a lot of laning um because of all the lane swaps that we
2:14:29
seeing so far and your teamwork with chy was just as fantastic and especially the drinks
2:14:37
and Gallo combo how was playing with him after such a long time you
2:14:43
know every time I see him play he's always really good and I feel like right now I can tell that he's gotten even
2:14:50
better and Jinx is actually on an undefeated
2:14:57
street so far so what about Jinx is so strong in this meta you know even in L she's very
2:15:05
decent to use and I think this Champion is especially Shin during team fights as
2:15:12
well so I think that's why her win rate is so high think we'll keep seeing I'm not too
2:15:19
sure about that I think we to play out and with's victory grp aler just
2:15:26
secured four wins so did you expect to get so ahead you know it was definitely not predictable or I I did not expect it
2:15:34
at all I knew that you know group Al was very strong and is very strong so I think it
2:15:41
was pretty inevitable let's finish out the interview with the slogan you came up
2:15:48
with we all shout out aler over 1 2
2:15:53
3 Elder over Baron and that's the end of the interview with ruler and back to the
2:16:00
space thank you thank you very much dear as it is
2:16:07
Elder over Baron 4 to one after the first round of matches here in the inaugural lck cup thanks to a 20 geneng
2:16:15
over the reigning Champs of the lck Hana life Esports welcome back to the space Deon along side wolf and wadid and we
2:16:23
finally get our first series that doesn't go three games and it's the Champs getting put on their behind by
2:16:30
gen G I said it after game one that I thought hanell would bounce back with their drafting they certainly did not um
2:16:37
ruler looked fantastic across both games more of a facilitator on his Ash he's 45
2:16:42
and 25 on ash in total is jinx is 23 and seven an almost unanimous vote for ruler
2:16:48
as well coming through um he you know the only other person I thought you could have vote for was chobi so I
2:16:54
respect that vote and this is my comment his arrows captured my heart he captured
2:16:59
the victory as well that was that's cutesy little cutesy there all right well dude what did you have I mean for
2:17:04
me uh happy to see noxian style Ed Cary on the noan rift because he's one of the
2:17:09
aggressive Ed carry player he never uses his flash backwards he always fleshes in
2:17:15
looking for the panta and I feel like uh he's one of the ad carry uh many
2:17:21
normal people just look up to play like him oh yeah I think you go back to one
2:17:26
of the replays from game number one when I believe it was Zyra popped the ultimate he just steps right outside of
2:17:33
it once it's gone steps right back on in never misses the beat or ult yummy is
2:17:38
the quote I I'll give Chi some credit for that one but you know Zas did kind of ult with a Gallo on top of him but
2:17:45
you know there were a lot of great plays from chy Top damage in that game as well um with an ad80 carry like this I tank
2:17:51
for life and the life after that's that's a great comment there I saw similar comment yesterday as well but I
2:17:56
mean he's always talking about the tank tanker yeah yeah yesterday he said I
2:18:03
would tank for life this time he says I'll tank for life and the life after that's how much uh he was impressed with
2:18:08
ruler's play today let's take a look at the draft because draft one to draft two wolf you were the one saying both of you
2:18:15
guys were saying the the draft was weird it was weird by Hana life greedy by with
2:18:21
life Esports this time didn't get too much better I mean it's even worse maybe I mean probably it's the draft that is
2:18:27
worst draft that we have in lck Cup by far because I mean just look at the
2:18:33
draft they have like Ash and Leona once again you have better supports and also I mean it's just so weird to have like
2:18:39
those kind of team cup with Zyra I mean sure if you play perfectly then it's
2:18:44
okay but it's also same for the game two as well they had so many weird Champions
2:18:50
together that it doesn't synergizing well together and also you have oron Jes
2:18:56
and didn't he didn't even use the ulti correctly once in that game yeah I mean the game two draft things don't get that
2:19:02
much better like you say because there's a lot of Champs that are going to struggle into what uh you know gendi has
2:19:09
put together here and jeni kept everything super flexible right the Gallo lockin can follow the Aurora if it
2:19:14
ends up being Flex so that's a really cool thing that they lock in there and then you see bands on Zia and Ezreal
2:19:20
which is fine I understand it but there's nothing locked in just yet and then ruler gets to play a well protected Jinx composition here there's no way to
2:19:27
deny that Lulu to come through not realistically here with what's left and the or could have been a nice front line
2:19:32
for a lot of other 80 carries but the Tristana doesn't really work well with or as a front liner works well with the
2:19:38
vi works well with the Aurora to try to set up resets but ultimately you're just out ranged massively yeah let's take a
2:19:43
look at the highlights here first one 630 where uh again just not quite hunter
2:19:51
life Esports de uh probably this is one of the fight that probably hunter life should win harder because their
2:19:58
Champions basically they want to look for small skirmishes uh everywhere they
2:20:03
have Tristana they have rakan they have Vice so they can jump in wherever they want so probably they should win harder
2:20:09
than that but after this first moment they were kind of splited and it was
2:20:15
really not synchronized yeah I mean look at this here for Zas going back in with Viper and and for what they're not going
2:20:21
to be able to get that last grub and Zas has no man I mean yes it's a Tristana that if he can get a kill they can get a
2:20:26
reset but they just really weren't aware of the the health bars then we kind of double down this is that moment that was that goo was talking about earlier where
2:20:32
there's an interrupt on Z's ult and just a really bizarre super broken up fight
2:20:37
look at Zea on the back side of this fight he can offer really nothing and you know it's a reset race between these
2:20:43
two teams with Tristana and Jinx and when you get that first pick and you have the better setup you're going to win it every time and if you're doing
2:20:49
the front to back uh just normal team fight then you cannot win against Jinx Lulu that's impossible yeah and and
2:20:55
we're highlighting those things because it's a high-profile move obviously the biggest move in the lck the most talked
2:21:01
about move in the lck let me correct it because ruler might have something to say about that with the Dorne and zuu switch but also how disjointed it felt
2:21:09
here for Hana life Esports and then in the mid lane once you're that far ahead ruler and the rest of geni just take
2:21:15
advantage across the map in Viper's defense here you know if if you can actually win out on this play if misses
2:21:20
anything if you s step a zap you actually probably get this kill um but the insta Ward here from ruler he
2:21:27
predicts the jump he has the barrier Advantage it's just not the play that it's not a play that's going to work out
2:21:32
but I think you could really feel the desperation in Viper in this moment maybe if I kill him here we can turn this into something but ultimately ruler
2:21:38
just outplays him there has the barrier and that was really to me like the last naale in the coffin uh there was so many
2:21:44
problems in this draft for hle and one desperate move wasn't enough to get them back into it I'm just wondering if they
2:21:50
plan to pick Tristana or it was just a panic pick I feel like it it was just one of the panic pick that it can happen
2:21:56
in F this draft and this is the reason why I'm keep saying that uh you really need to focus on the draft as a coaching
2:22:03
staff your players cannot really involve uh to think about the draft during the game right so your coaching sta really
2:22:10
need to step up absolutely and I like that point because coaches can do so many different types of things but in
2:22:16
draft you get 30 seconds that's it those quick uh quick um Split Second decisions
2:22:22
happen very very fast some coaches better at it than others coach uh Kim really really good at it here for ji as
2:22:28
they take the victory let's take a look at the standings after the first round robin and remember this was ones verse
2:22:34
one twos vers twoos three vers threes all the way across any other upset victories will be exactly that upsets
2:22:41
because you're going to have a higher seed against a lower seed so group Elder 4 to one here it's really huge that both
2:22:47
T1 and hle the highest profile player or teams from group Baron fell um and I
2:22:52
would say both of them being an upset right we did have chronicler predict geni to win this one I think a lot of people were on team jeni coming this
2:22:58
especially on the fan side of things with ruler coming back but those two wins are massive because you don't get take backs on those and they're really
2:23:05
going to affect the rest of the standings and the rest of how these weeks two and three play out y I mean my biggest reason why I picked the H life
2:23:11
Esports over geni is because of the support Gap but it happened in an opposite way I feel like Duro fit in the
2:23:18
geni side really well and even though it was first game in lck it didn't feel like he's playing for the first time
2:23:23
well group Baron need to get back on track and if they're going to do so it's going to be the Bros up against Nim both
2:23:29
squads looking for their first Victory and to help out their groups to make it to the lck up lck Cup playoffs who will
2:23:35
do it let's find out after this short break

okay
3:06:45
on hello and welcome back to the 2025 lck cup we are getting into the second
3:06:51
match of the night this one is really the hype one that has everything on the line we had geni versus S life not very
3:06:58
interesting was very one-sided don't don't even watch the V actually do watch theide because ruler is a madman and his
3:07:06
team is really good at drafting but it was polite of them to get out of the way quickly have a quick Series so we can get to the real meat and potatoes of the
3:07:13
night is Nong shim against bro especially with how things are being kind of lining up with the group battle
3:07:20
group Baron is slacking so bro need a win they need it for the fans they need it for themselves they need for group
3:07:27
Baron um they need it for Deon yeah they do uh deon's going to be very sad if bro
3:07:33
doesn't win this one um but uh I'm I'm sure he's used to it by now but that's okay um that's not why we follow bro uh
3:07:40
by any means uh anyway so Nong Sim and brro already taking a loss so far and
3:07:46
they're looking to to get one win one of these teams will have at least one win
3:07:51
in the group stage the question is which one we were very hyped for bro coming off their kesp cup win with their new
3:07:58
roster uh you know a couple of rookies joining up in uh hok and then we had
3:08:04
hype as well and Bulls up there as well and for Nim you know the other side you
3:08:10
know they grab a couple of veterans try to make something make some match with the the skill of gu and fiser and couple
3:08:16
of junglers uh that are rotating it's it's going to be interesting to see how it goes but it
3:08:21
didn't look very good at first for Nim and for bro you know not quite able to hit the mark either it's also relevant
3:08:28
for you know obviously your team wants to win but your placement the team decides whether you go all the way through or you have to play still or if
3:08:34
you're the losing group whether you get knocked out so important to get your standing in the group up as
3:08:39
well yeah so Edgar had this to say about getting reverse swept um have they
3:08:45
bounced back he was disappointed you know they had a big advantage in game three against DX but they played like
3:08:52
they did in practice I suppose practice is not going very well uh noin is on a
3:08:59
seven match winning streak against bro that's a lot of matches in a row a TR between two teams since 2023 lck spring
3:09:07
that was your debut ax yep I think I I think I cast it I think
3:09:14
that was one of the best Ser I cast if I remember correctly time is a flat circle
3:09:19
we're back we're back we're we're so back uh yeah and Bros actually switched out the ready carry so we saw hype
3:09:24
briefly uh and now bll is coming in uh bu was on Quon freaks uh last year and
3:09:32
I'm not necessarily A tributing this to him but it started off really well and then went downhill but that was kind of
3:09:37
half of the cause for The Quon freak so don't necessarily put that solely on him
3:09:43
but hopefully we get to see him perform at the level he was when he first came onto the roster and really made some
3:09:49
waves it's just crazy to me that it's been 293 days since we've seen b play in the lck like I I could have sworn he
3:09:57
played in summer but I I guess not you know and here he is out for bro tonight
3:10:03
as the two teams will walk out on stage and give the fist bumps maybe we'll get some flexes from the Giga Chads in green
3:10:11
let's see just some fist bumps so far as Pao Towers over everyone I also think
3:10:17
bll just kind of Suits the the Bro Vibe you know when he was star for freaks had
3:10:23
a lot of uh lot of fun moments shown a lot of Personality flexing for the camera and stuff so hopefully he gets
3:10:29
the chance to do that today oh we're uh we're doing some
3:10:35
they're looking up at the ceiling okay they figured it out and Gideon coming in here to start
3:10:42
for this matchup you know some routines we see I'm like they definitely practice that a ho I don't think they did with
3:10:47
that one I think that was fair of the moment yeah uh have to get a win against
3:10:55
elder group who is now 4- one right now um you do not want to be in the losing
3:11:01
group based on this new format it will not be good for your chances you will be not having a good seed don't want to be
3:11:08
the bottom of your group it's I mean that's the thing is like obviously you want your group to do well but you want
3:11:13
to be at the top of your group so you're in a much better position uh so the wins are important for you and for your team
3:11:19
if you're last place and you're in the losing group you're out done yeah that's it your LC cup is done you play three
3:11:27
weeks of matches two and a half that's it and if you're in the last place and you're in the winning group you have to
3:11:32
play against the top teams from the losing group so in the plays yeah yeah and those are the teams who will have
3:11:38
beaten you cuz you're the bottom of your group so uh yeah definitely definitely better to be in
3:11:45
the winning group but also better to be at the top of whatever group you find yourself in I think is the the memo the
3:11:50
lesson from this one uh so H new format things have changed a lot but you know what's the saying Brandon wins are good
3:11:58
that is what we're learning this if you're confused you're like what's the LC CL I don't know what's I don't know
3:12:04
what's going on it doesn't matter it's fine just win and you're you're going to be good you're golden that's all you got
3:12:10
to do yeah there's this new system in place where the more you win the better your season goes uh ji kind of mastered
3:12:16
that last year so I feel like they're implementing a similar strategy bro and Nim not as good at that strategy in the
3:12:23
past but hoping to show yeah be a bit better on it now they've been working on
3:12:28
it uh that whole winning thing um you know I like how our production phrased
3:12:33
it as well you bro desperate for a win they bring in Bull it's been a long time since we've seen him and we don't really
3:12:40
know what his form is like as you mentioned he was very up and then he was very down with Quang dong so is he on an
3:12:46
upswing right now he must be for them to put him in like we were all very hyped for hype right he is a fantastic
3:12:52
Prospect from we knew what he's capable of wasn't really quite able to show it
3:12:58
all so I think maybe they want to bring in that more veteran player in Bull even though bull doesn't have a huge amount
3:13:04
of lck experience he has been playing for a long time yeah I mean we don't know exactly how practice been going
3:13:10
from what Ed said it seems like not not so hot but definitely trying different things obviously these winds are really
3:13:16
important an so you know they've had these two players on the roster so they can obviously switch between them theend
3:13:22
in the situation do I think that the previous series was specifically hyp fault I I don't think so but hopefully
3:13:28
they can find something better and again you know a lot of people you think about bro you think about Nim historically
3:13:34
we've seen them in recent years towards the bottom of the table but Nim got some big names on the roster and bro one
3:13:40
Casper cup so I feel like expectations have been higher as a result you know
3:13:45
the fact that have lens and kingan now uh both players who have obviously gone
3:13:51
a long way both domestically and internationally um well King and also internationally a world win and that's
3:13:58
pretty good yeah yeah it's pretty good it's pretty all right if you keep winning eventually you get that going back to this you know it's it's tried
3:14:05
and true uh but get in the draft you know gante yon very popular bands at the moment the quy band coming through not
3:14:11
something we've seen as much in a first rotation ban but scarner definitely part of the course other picks that Academy
3:14:18
left open the bot laners so Ash varis kalista often get a look in the vi is
3:14:23
gone so a lot of AD carries still open that we often see banned away so a lot of power there uh I know that bull is a
3:14:31
menace on kalist that is a picky is known for so this Fierce pick from Nim to deny it makes a ton of sense I guess
3:14:39
in the context of it bro were like maybe they'll leave us CL but we don't want them to have CL Nico uh and N like we're
3:14:45
not leaving you CL so B Theo you want we're taking that regardless guess into this ash or varis both do fine in
3:14:52
clister uh is is playable but you definitely want an ad carry with that early pressure you're not uh forced to
3:14:58
take it now they will take the ambessa but they do deny that rard away for so
3:15:04
no kada no kist ni trying to trim the tools that are available to the hens yeah I mean those are the best ones the
3:15:10
thing is though is that you can only do so well I mean kalista can pretty much go with anything you know you got an
3:15:16
enchant who needs a little bit of extra protection maybe not the best but it can go with the kalista you got a tank that
3:15:22
you want to throw in and create some some uh some waves in the team fight
3:15:27
that can compare with the kalista yeah I think the logic here is that with Nik gone Nik is like the premier kalist
3:15:34
pairing when you're into rard so I think they're trying to force Nong shim to take a melee support which is bad into
3:15:40
verardo but we'll see I mean it's lens of all players he is definitely one to
3:15:46
stay away from the norm and bring out some some spicy picks and support wall I guess him and carrier uh but we do see
3:15:51
the rumble and the Sani come through which are just ltk Staples at this point um so nothing too crazy on there from
3:15:57
long shim and nowon I think you take ad carry here uh if you want to secure like the virus of the ash but looks like
3:16:04
they're more focused on the Aurora not as concerned about those ad carry picks for B which makes me think
3:16:11
they have something prepared pocket I mean that's the other thing because bull can just play Draven rata right he is a
3:16:18
huge kalista player but he's also a huge Draven player so if you ban Ash varis he's like okay I'll just play Draven so
3:16:25
have to ban Draven which means one of Ash and varus is available and he can just play that instead yeah I think
3:16:30
maybe the varus would make more sense I feel like ash not really a pick I would
3:16:37
expect to see bull bring out but I mean I'm sure you can play it but not something got a tribute to him necessarily the blitz crank ban away
3:16:43
from H makes complete sense that pick is obviously something he likes to Le on up also great into radoo specifically uh
3:16:50
and Jace just going to be denied uh concerned that maybe fish would play in the mid lanane uh I mean
3:16:57
in theory could be flexed I mean in theory the rumble could be flexed support we're talking really crazy stuff but kind of keep it it what we expect uh
3:17:04
is that Rumble in the Top Lane and now will they B an ad carry
3:17:09
here or will they go look we can't ban them both let's just ban something else and it looks like that's the option so
3:17:15
you know they opt to get ever the are they know that one of these Z carries is going to go through for B uh which I think you can just take
3:17:24
here maybe if you're concerned about support counter pick you leave it but I think just take it carry here and then
3:17:29
the final pick uh you can kind of see a bit more of the composition and he does take the varus which I think is not much
3:17:36
of a surprise yeah kind of following this draft it all kind of makes sense so far you know um I I'm curious to see how
3:17:43
this is going to round out for Nim it feels like at the moment you kind of just press R buttons and you've got a
3:17:49
Target and you kind of go all in will they get a bunch of picks that can go well with that and why is fiser
3:17:57
laughing what has he got up his sleeve Elise oh for L hands yeah least support
3:18:04
we been see this played a good amount uh and honestly this probably makes sense
3:18:10
as a good Lane in verada uh if you land the Cocoon like one of the things that rard struggles to do the reason Blitz crank is a good pick is like longer
3:18:16
ranging engage uh if you have to run into it it's problematic but you throw the Cocoon you can throw a full combo a
3:18:22
lot of beer damage between this bot Lane of Mong shim let see what the mid lane pick and
3:18:28
they're going for the smolder so you know this is a team composition where you have a lot of early power and they're like you know what let's slam
3:18:35
some insurance in let's get let's get coverage for the late game yeah that is what smolder is you got two layers of
3:18:42
fire you know Rumble drops his alt on top of a cc Target now we got knocked turn on the opposite side but you drop
3:18:49
that you drop mom on top of that right you you just get a bunch of layering uh damage and uh obviously it's not going
3:18:56
to do too much damage but yeah it is kind of that late game insurance policy whereas on the opposite side the
3:19:01
knockturn you know we've seen it with the Oriana for obvious reasons I'm not sure how I feel about it
3:19:07
in this draft in particular yeah I mean it gives a lot of threat I mean there's a lot of dive Potential from this top
3:19:13
side of bro specifically if you're targeting the clist or you're targeting molder they have tools to take them out
3:19:19
um but it definitely feels like you know this Kista El least Lane is going to be problematic to deal with also we talked
3:19:25
about Towers being hard to dive at least you know you can just repel and drop the aggro if it ends up being a swap
3:19:32
situation to avoid this problematic Lane they will just dive your top laner very
3:19:37
comfortably yeah I'm sure that lens has been practicing and he is ready for
3:19:44
whatever it takes if it's Dives if it's just you know playing standard Elite
3:19:49
support as as well as you can do that you know that's pretty cool wearing
3:19:54
sunglasses indoors ah she recently got lasic so
3:20:02
that's why so she can only watch with the sound well there you go that's one way
3:20:09
to enjoy the lck cup yep honestly the last series when uh Zea Valkyrie did
3:20:16
probably was a better experience if you only had this no one wanted to see that yeah well
3:20:22
guys we got game number one let's jump into it
3:20:38
now and here we go game one between Nim and bro if uh if you're new to the lck for
3:20:46
some reason and you don't know hey like why is lens playing Elise support um this guy he
3:20:52
played C support and he played Elise support uh for a very long time in Solo he's famous for it and it's it's
3:20:59
actually pretty good nowadays so at the same time we got lens if he has an any
3:21:06
excuse to play this kind of champion he will and this is a very easy one especially with the kalista because you
3:21:12
can drop in you can do a bunch of first damage you can be saved thrown back you know or you can be thrown forward maybe to land a cocon you got some really nice
3:21:19
long uh engage with that I mean especially we've seen a lot of supports running heal uh instead of ignite
3:21:25
recently in the lck the fact that you have ignite you have Elise you have electrocute which you know last year got
3:21:31
buffed have more early damage I genuinely think level three you any Target in the game you can just
3:21:37
burst down on like a full rotation between Elise and clist uh we do see the swap coming through uh and as I said if
3:21:45
there's any support that can off a dive I think at least is that champion you
3:21:50
can see them zoning Morgan away from XP and also chunking him out a bit so really setting up for potential dive
3:21:58
later if we see Gideon path on over here right now on the opposite side of the map
3:22:03
though I feel like G is one of the uh ad carries with the most restraint in the
3:22:09
lck like the fact that he's he's going ahead zoning Morgan instead of going for
3:22:14
the melee uh minions and just letting all three die as an 80 carry player wow
3:22:20
respect yep what you got to do XP is King in the uni game uh If you deny
3:22:26
levels from Morgan uh it's going to make the dive so much easier we saw uh OT in
3:22:32
the previous series Z planing off the DI as Essa uh but getting those levels getting
3:22:38
those extra abilities it really makes a huge difference in these early plays now we do see Hollow moving
3:22:44
over uh kind of being there to defend in case a dive was to happen uh and obviously with no jungler
3:22:51
there might be tricky to do this 2 oh never mind oh The Flash in with the Cocoon but with the ranata shield
3:22:57
especially it is going to save his life you see that lens he's got the repell
3:23:02
goes up doesn't take the second tower hit and Morgan will be safe but definitely a little bit shaken after
3:23:09
that play yeah really low on HP now as well and that was a level two dive when level three comes in which J has just
3:23:16
hit going to be a lot of threat as well so he doesn't die but the pressure is there
3:23:21
on Morgan and po forun hit level two as well so has some abilities he can use
3:23:28
not a fun Lane to be in if I'm going to be honest but to be fair King and not really having fun playing it to varus
3:23:34
either I mean at least it's just the varus but yeah still not going to be too
3:23:40
funny he's just farming under turret and Gideon has gone for a full clear SK crab he's going in going to drop a Warp
3:23:46
probably uh in the enemy jungle and he's actually just going to sit here and wait for
3:23:53
humach and oh okay has found him and you know what L here maybe if he had flashed
3:23:58
could have made something happen but he used that in the uh the play on top there a pick closer maybe could have happen spell shield used by hamach to
3:24:05
block the second part of the uh the view yeah well now we got the Cocoon and hak
3:24:10
in a bit of trouble has to flash away and you can see that meanwhile Nim Gideon able to pick up all the Raptors
3:24:16
pretty much you know it's such an interesting Dynamic where you have a range support
3:24:21
into rard which is obviously something you want rather than like a melee support pairs well with the CL but also
3:24:27
Stacks the Sani passive really fast uh when you're in spider form so it actually sinks well with multiple Champs
3:24:33
on the Sim and bro I feel like in terms of early pressure you just can't really
3:24:39
match up right now to that uh that pairing we do see uh King returning to
3:24:46
the Top Lane now is pretty far ahead compared to Morgan but we can see that D
3:24:52
is down compared to Bull so all in all things are balanced as a team but advantages and disadvantages across some
3:24:58
of these Lanes yeah Fisher just going to sneeze on closer there plus you Fisher
3:25:06
and that's going to keep closer around closer does not have his teleport and he's relatively healthy but he doesn't have a lot of Mana so he's just kind of
3:25:13
catching waves he doesn't have a lot of Lane pressure because of that and uh you know in one sense that does mean that
3:25:19
fer gets to just free Farm but also it does mean that there's not a lot of trading going on which is another great
3:25:24
way to get some Stacks so fer happy and sad he's just going to go back buy up
3:25:30
some more items and head back to the mid lane kind of funny to see not J playing
3:25:37
uh the smolder by the way yeah um definitely a very memorable smaller performance we had from him last time
3:25:43
you can see the en of jiu if they full information I think they could very
3:25:48
comfortably dive Morgan there but didn't know if there's anyone around uh poly waiting the wings so they end up backing
3:25:54
off and just clearing out some Vision don't want to overstep and make a mistake and the H not having flash does
3:26:00
mean it's a little bit trickier to pull off those dies than otherwise now moving up towards the
3:26:05
grubs uh and remember this is a pre6 nocturn so hand back the goal is just
3:26:10
get a grub and get out they're actually tping in he did get that Smite so he'd
3:26:16
be happy just to leave now they're actually looking for the fight here as they want to take down Gideon and it's
3:26:22
not quite going to happen but they do pully them out oh that flash handshake though on a laen and there you go first
3:26:27
Blood also given over to Bro here as bit of damage from Mom but that's about it
3:26:33
as we'll have a least grub get smited down and BR are so happy with that fight triple grubs they can be super happy
3:26:40
with that outcome and it feels like nongam just wi is prepared to fight this you know I'm thinking knocked in level five not really having the impact uh but
3:26:49
ends up just being heavily favored towards bro and also bow who has been solo Lane level six already J only level
3:26:56
four on this kalista that is a pretty large difference uh and I think one of the
3:27:03
things was as well so you know Rumble isn't able to get PRI against the Baris here but UL comes in does a decent
3:27:08
amount of damage uh and they kind of disengage but rumble's so late and he's
3:27:14
level six he's got a lot of power but by that time at least was already dead G was just engaging it just feels like bro was so
3:27:21
much more prepared to take this fight than Nim were yeah it's almost like no shim didn't want to take a pipe but they
3:27:27
wanted the grubs and bro are like yeah by the way we're in the game like we are going to challenge you over this and we
3:27:33
are prepared to do so yeah now having oh no getting all three grubs so you got a
3:27:38
little bit of progress towards those neutral objective Fe strength he also got Fierce blood so bro a lot closer and
3:27:46
to ticking those boxes than Nim are right now you can see this is kind of the outcome bull is obviously ahead of
3:27:52
levels compared to jiu has a lot of power there but his Top Lane match up not fun for Morgan right
3:27:58
now yeah not really much he can do about it he's very far behind um down a level
3:28:05
down almost double Cs and it's Rumble so just kind of sitting back it was uh nice
3:28:12
to see the choice to go for Sani Rumble I feel like we have seen a lot lot of teams kind of go for weird stuff even H
3:28:18
Sports in game one of the last series just kind of being a little bit too fancy they're like no we'll just go for
3:28:24
the strong fcks that uh do things and we can build a comp around it rounding it
3:28:29
out with smolder wasn't on my bingo card though looks like bro second objective just like that oan Drake on the cards
3:28:36
for them and that's a very nice early Drake to have and to get Fierce blood to get all three grubs and to get ocean
3:28:42
dragon with a noctune and he hasn't even pressed Al yet that that that feels so good for bro I mean it feels like
3:28:48
they're kind of hitting everything they want uh in terms of how this early game is going so far and the fact that Morgan
3:28:54
was the one to pick up the kill so despite the fact he is down in terms of experience uh he is pretty close in
3:29:00
terms of Gold All Things Considered trying to set something up here on a closer who does have his flash
3:29:09
I I and it's smolder it's not plausible I mean I don't see a situation where
3:29:15
you're able to get the and mo she probably force a r and then she just like bounces to the other side
3:29:21
so don't see anything don't find anything lens looking for some aggressive angles here has gone in the s
3:29:26
shoes uh rush so movement speed getting around but also just that flat pen so much
3:29:32
damage wouldn't it be neat if you could upgrade those boots even further yeah that would be
3:29:37
pretty neat they should add that to the game um they did I don't think they've added it to this game for an onction
3:29:44
though no I mean bro need these next grubs are coming up if they get three of those they got it if they get a dragon
3:29:51
they've got it uh Nim needs so much to deny it to get it themselves uh I don't
3:29:58
want to say it's like 100% but I I think it's kind of locked in for bro in fact I would actually go as far as to say is if
3:30:04
Nong shim don't find a good angle to fight they should just give up the Feats of Strength because you know trying to
3:30:10
prevent it might just end up costing you more yeah um maybe if you get like a Tower then
3:30:16
we're kind of talking but not super realistic a grub a single grub grab a
3:30:22
single grub and dip that would work but we'll see H we do see recalls coming in now from Fisher he's heading towards the
3:30:29
bot Lane does have that TP they're moving King and up with that equalizer so they want to see if they can make
3:30:34
something happen here could end up being the first knock turn ult off the game I mean they know that he is right
3:30:42
there and they should be ready for it this time I hope for sham and they're just going to get one and get out and
3:30:48
just try to deny the objective cakon lands but a cleans and bullish just fine
3:30:53
as Now The Equalizer comes in after all of that Pao in a bit of a rough spot but he has uh the ability to maybe survive
3:31:01
no he's going to go down and besta as well Morgan going way to dp's out and that's three kills for Nong shim just
3:31:06
like that yeah huge team fight comes out from Nong shim they did the hom workk this time they were prepared so much
3:31:12
more ready uh Unfortunately they don't get the three Gres themselves so still behind in those feat of strength but the
3:31:18
fight goes in their favor I feel like the target selection was pretty on point there the difference it makes having you
3:31:23
Rumble there in the fight we'll see little bit of a misplay was the ult from Gideon the cleans had already come
3:31:30
through and it's it's a shortened one but then this equalizer managing to clip B but also set the front line they
3:31:35
focused down po quickly hand back Dives in lens bounces him with a clister old
3:31:41
and just so quickly the fight goes in favor of Nong shim and it feels like it was a mirror of the earlier fight at
3:31:47
grubs in the other direction where bro just weren't prepared Wen ready for the fight to happen you can see what you want about
3:31:54
uh Champion strength strength and stuff like that but like an Essa that's this far behind and zoned away from the rest
3:32:00
of her team and like not really able to find a good angle to go in with an OCT turn he just just got melted and didn't
3:32:06
do anything like it's not even really Morgan's fault it's just the way that n were able to set up these early lanes
3:32:12
and really put set him behind we have F LeAndre now done for King and we have you know a couple of stuff found in a
3:32:20
toolbx here for Morgan so he's got a long way to go yeah and the thing is as
3:32:25
the game goes on it's going to be more and more important that bro get onto nonin
3:32:30
backline uh I feel like the entire top side that's going to really be their goal is connecting on of the key targets
3:32:36
whereas you know B can obviously he can fire some ult he can fire some big arrows he can connect with them but he's
3:32:42
not really able to cut through the front line of longin particularly quickly and considering you know Sani is going to be
3:32:47
very bulky we've seen like bulky Rumble builds as well uh this theal varus you
3:32:53
really need to be hitting key targets it's going to be about threatening that backline uh for bro and Landing Landing
3:33:00
the engage yeah I mean you know we'll see if they can do that uh they have some
3:33:06
pretty nice dive with the top side combo I feel like the varus and the ranata is a bit of you know well Bull's going to
3:33:14
throw in some arrows and if somebody gets low we've got the ability to maybe keep them alive with the ranada that
3:33:20
that's my one concern is like the Rada oh bull is in trouble has to flash
3:33:26
didn't have cleans so yeah some interesting things so we had the lethal Tempo come out from bull which typically
3:33:32
means like on hit varis but he has gone for fality so not sure if was like a
3:33:38
decision that changed once you got in a game or maybe it's just so he has a bit more DPS with that auality varus um the
3:33:45
rard though I feel like doesn't fit as well with the rest of the comp it was picked up as a denial but we'll see what they can get done here they are looking
3:33:51
yeah I mean we're just going in with the dive trying to get that backline but it's just the kalista old once again to
3:33:57
bounce up the knockturn but now no he's just going to be burned to a Cris by the rumble Morgan finally takes out the
3:34:03
kalista but at what cost so many low health bars though closer has the chase potential that's a double kill for the
3:34:09
Aurora very good stuff at the end of that fight for bro to try to claw their way back in this game a value there
3:34:16
closer doing a lot of work with the ultimate and N shame kite back diving away but just felt like they couldn't
3:34:21
get the damage out initially I think for me Fisher was a little bit overextended here so you know he gets hit by the
3:34:29
knock goes by has to flash immedately to get over the wall and then they all get caught by this rard Al I was talking
3:34:35
like maybe the verado not sinking as well with the pump but if you get an all like that H you always going to get huge value po doing a massive amount there
3:34:42
and then Clos just with a chase down and pick up those kills so huge value on that rard ult there uh and it feels like
3:34:49
we're going back and forth you know in terms of teams finding their wincons finding their team fight wi cons and
3:34:55
Landing uh these engages that they need yeah it is a very important fight
3:35:00
as well because you know it prevents Nim from taking that Dragon away I wouldn't even be surprised if we just group up
3:35:07
around this again the difference being though that the rift Herald is going to spawn in 50 seconds so no they want to
3:35:13
get this bursted down first and looks like we are going to have uh
3:35:19
the rest of bro just hang around the top side of the map and just give this one up so yeah it's good that n able to get
3:35:25
this I guess uh bro not really comfortable fighting without the ult I feel like their team cop is so much more ult riing and they are some long cool
3:35:31
Downs they even have like the hex plate from nocturn um ultimate ability haste
3:35:36
but this is one of the problems though with bro already having that first blood and being two out of three is that it's
3:35:41
not enough just to take Dragon you also have to take Herald you also just have to keep chaining these objectives cuzz
3:35:47
if any of them go over to bro you lose of strength yeah can't lose your turret you know yeah so they have to really be
3:35:53
on point from here on out and considering how back and forth this game has been not going to necessarily be
3:35:58
easy bro kind of getting control of this area now some good Vision as Nim lean towards the dragon they kind of secured
3:36:04
some WS here and get the Scuttle crab but now this might be it shim we'll see
3:36:10
them scry over but the hen just went to base so maybe Gideon tried to steal
3:36:16
maybe a late contest or maybe they just it looks like a late contest is coming in TP from King in can get and get there
3:36:21
in time I don't think so so they're going to give the pizza strength and then they're going to go for the fight the run out of glass skul tier just to
3:36:28
try to get out but look at the Wombo Combo coming in as we do have a kill from closer to start out though and
3:36:34
everybody survived and now this ambessa is just running wild but again not very fed King in level 11 as well that's
3:36:40
going to scare them off but again bro just got kind of a free Rift Herald plus a Kill
3:36:47
and now you got the enhanced recoil you just get out CL is playing on another level compared to everyone else it felt like everything was hitting for Nim it
3:36:53
look like the textbook hey we're hitting all this AOE they should be good but
3:36:58
just assassinating the cler so we see the alss quite early The Equalizer does a decent amount of damage and then this
3:37:04
combo of the CL old smolder old this turnar around from hand back and closer this mid jungle Duo getting so much
3:37:11
value here and then the rest of bro just gets to walk away Morgan buys him some time and the disengage so
3:37:18
considering the cool impact ultimates came from long shim the fight didn't go over to them and now feature strength
3:37:24
gone to bro yeah you know I I think this composition on paper um you know you
3:37:29
line up a sedel to kalist to O to drop everything on top but we're seeing a lot of like okay I'm going to equalize her
3:37:35
now and okay now we're going to throw in the Elise and how about we you know it's not like it's not as crisp as I think it
3:37:42
needs to be for how close this game is you know I think uh Nim obviously went for the late game Insurance off this
3:37:49
Moulder but it just feels like now they're getting absolutely pummeled with the premiums because the Aurora is doing
3:37:55
so much more um and the impact Clos is having on this fight is substantial like yes the it's not like on Fisher I'm not
3:38:02
saying Fisher is not doing his job oh boy well we're in a lot of trouble here for jiu as there's just no Escape Bach
3:38:08
again making a play and he's got one target it's the kalista every single time lands it's where'd he go
3:38:16
wait why was he there uh that's a ton of damage though from the rumble and the
3:38:22
one tap with the auto and an equalizer here kingan's like all right well the hens did that but I am kingan and I am
3:38:29
looking to get some extra kills on the board Flash Forward but now the rest of the team is here this is getting real
3:38:35
messy as coming down is Mom Fisher looking for some extra kills bold a nice
3:38:41
flash away from the queue by the sedani there Gideon and all the while the rift was just
3:38:47
pushing mid it's just so volatile it's just so back and forth um very chaotic here so
3:38:55
initially this is a great pick from bro uh there is no complaints at all about this they just pick up you NOS isolated
3:39:02
fantastic then they try and look for the hens and again like I think this is fine up to this point I think the problem is
3:39:10
after that you know Morgan starts getting roasted by kingan he could just ult out but he ult it thinking I can
3:39:16
fight him King is so strong already and then the rest just kind of get baited in you can see H back hovering around bollo
3:39:23
that ends up getting hit he ends up overstaying as a result and this TP flly like I said I feel like the smaller
3:39:30
not really hit the late game yet but fer is doing everything he needs to connects the AL comes in cleans up a kill some
3:39:37
extra gold for the smaller really appreciated and considering this game is now slightly in favor of nim you know I
3:39:44
think when bro were pulling ahead when bro was looking good that's when the concern was but if smolder gets online
3:39:49
the game is just going to be cooked yeah it's uh it's one of these games that I think For Better or For Worse has been
3:39:56
very back and forth you know we've had teams get leads and then just not be as
3:40:02
clean as they need to be to continue with those leads uh again B just out of
3:40:07
C it's the only one we have here oh right now it's actually Nim's turn to Pro so they're heading over to adakan
3:40:12
we'll see um doing adakan at 20 minutes with all five members alive with only
3:40:19
1,000 gold the lead against knt Aurora yeah it's a bold decision um and one
3:40:24
they have currently opted out of so I respect that there is Dragon coming up is cloud Soul um but they are moving towards to
3:40:32
get mid PRI but not really leaning towards the dragon they want they want arakan apparently I mean if you can get control
3:40:40
of mid and top you can at least try to beat it right there's not a lot of vision around here as there's the kakoon and you have so much followup somebody
3:40:47
had to check and this time unfortunately it is Pao the president
3:40:54
and you know even though like of all the people to lose you'd rather lose your support than anyone else the rard AL is
3:41:00
so powerful in these fights and the fact that you're losing the P of providing Vision long like cool we got a pick time
3:41:06
to go adakan and they will lose dragon in return but you know it's a dragon a
3:41:12
piece I don't think losing a dragon here is that big of an issue the question really is going to be what can you do with zakan I'm looking mid and Bot those
3:41:18
low Towers I think you can do a lot even the celestial opposition won't save Hollow here and it's unfortunate cuz
3:41:24
someone kind of had to face check but it was a good trap set by Nong shim uh they
3:41:29
did their homework with that vision control Dragon was secured by bro and I'm look like mid Tower is low bot
3:41:36
Tower's low we've seen games before where you get the the Adam buff and you take you know four or so Towers in a
3:41:42
push this is what nongshim should be looking to do yeah I mean that's really all you want
3:41:48
to do with this kind of buff even if you do die if you're getting trades it's not a real trade and you could just see
3:41:55
Morgan like farming the bottom Lane he's just totally absent in this game and again I'll I'll reiterate it's really
3:42:01
not his fault like yeah face checking the Rumble that was his fault but the way that the early laning phase played
3:42:08
out against the at least support like how often is he going to play that and then he had to go up against fed Rumble
3:42:13
but now they're looking for lens and here's an equalizer pretty good and the follow up toach as we are just
3:42:20
jumping on in taking down the knockturn and looking for a bit more closer has to go into the alt and just hop away don'ts
3:42:28
him find another one I would love to see how that looked From lens's perspective
3:42:34
because he got aled and then was like getting thrown back to base while getting throw it very weird very strange
3:42:41
interaction coming out there but ultimately Nim get what they want at least not the Target you want to go for I mean with with the attam buff it
3:42:47
doesn't really matter if you die but the fact you have CL Al and the repel easy to shake stuff away and now they get uh
3:42:55
Towers they want in the bot Lane they looking mid as well if they can get Four Towers here I think that is very much a
3:43:01
successful use of the BFF yeah you don't have to five Man dive you don't have to
3:43:07
give them the extra blood pedals in Gold um but that's more fun right unless wow
3:43:13
that's a lot of wow I mean he's kind of out of the fight now and he will be taken out hok he is going for those
3:43:19
flowers he is going for that 100 gold and you know what the backline is totally just destroyed they will collect
3:43:26
everything here and you know they were just looking for one thing they got Pao
3:43:31
they didn't get the fourth turret it's not maybe not as good as it could have been there for nin but
3:43:37
they'll take it I think with it and they get more stacks for SM so that's something least be at Goen so
3:43:46
cuz he goes up goes down dies and then he gets like I guess he was still channeling like the I wonder what
3:43:52
happened if he stayed inside for longer would he being like yanked back out of it or would he I have no idea you know
3:43:59
like respawns get pulled all the way back that would sick um yeah intended yeah
3:44:06
intended uh and we see here you know just diving on the back line very aggressive King unfortunately can't get
3:44:12
closer but they do be in his Flash and obviously it's yakam buff we don't really care if we're hting it's just
3:44:20
it's very goofy uh and still a huge gold lead for Nim uh he wants it he wants a heart
3:44:28
steel stack you know what I think it makes me a bit sad how many times you seen Pro
3:44:34
where like the hard steel stack goes uned and you know they want it but they have to like not they have to show they
3:44:40
have to be professional un like the average a player who will just die repeatedly for single still Stacks we've
3:44:46
all done it we all know how it is # worth the HP is
3:44:52
permanent and you're stacking think about the the dopamine it just feels so good it accumulates so well right the
3:44:59
more HP you get the bigger the proc is the more HP you get the bigger the proc it just yeah it it's it's unavoidable um
3:45:07
putting something like that in the game is dangerous that's a take you get the attam buff so you can just go through the enemy team and get five procs and
3:45:13
die and it doesn't matter that's great um Morgan's still not having a great time the two solo laners here on the
3:45:20
side of nim are level 15 he's level 12 yeah he has one and a half items to
3:45:26
two and a half of kingan he just this is not an ambessa that is playing the game
3:45:32
at this moment so yeah this is 227 Stacks not looking great looking a
3:45:39
little bit rough H and kingan is just so absurdly strong right now 10 stacks on the dark seal uh and we have got smolder
3:45:47
over 225 Stacks so it's going to happen he's going to be
3:45:53
pretty strong uh almost has a rapid fire Cannon as well I think that's really where you'll start to feel it when you get the
3:45:59
longer range cues um yeah I think long shim now you know
3:46:06
obviously the atam buff is something where it tells you hey we want to fight but I think also just the the smaller Stacks are like you know what it's go
3:46:12
time D is on a ward so they could just kill him I mean they're all on a Ward
3:46:17
and bull just going to face kick it with cleans and that's going to be good that's going to be the end of jiu as now
3:46:23
Flash Forward the engage Rada and Morgan actually finds an angle can he do anything with it is the question and can
3:46:29
they kill kingan another good question as hak he is not going to be revived it
3:46:35
does look like kingan eventually should go down to closer here they have Vision he's level 16 it is a huge kill to take
3:46:43
down kingan at this point in the game bro keeping their hopes alive yeah and long shim should just be able to move
3:46:49
over and pick up this Dragon but fight going in favor bro not obviously ideal gold lead kept pretty close Clos is just
3:46:55
monstrously strong now on this uh Aurora and it kind of feels like it's just they
3:47:01
just kill jiu consistently it's so easy it doesn't even feel like they have to put that much effort in they just drop a couple of ss and then the fight kind of
3:47:07
pans out from there J Will been on a ward here and you see the team start to crawl
3:47:12
in uh and he just goes down so quickly we end up seeing uh kingan coming in and
3:47:19
just kind of melting people he does do an absurd amount of damage H back is allegedly tank that flash was
3:47:26
uh questionable I would say I think you could have not flash there let someone
3:47:31
else chase him down but they do eventually get him so I they with oh do they have P Al They Don't and not even
3:47:39
there land just out warding and this is again from minute one it's been like
3:47:46
this where the game has gone back and forth and back and forth and you were joking okay it's nin's turn to throw
3:47:52
they finally did it they did do it eventually it feels like you know there's been so much action in this game
3:47:59
like if there was potentially like two neutral monsters one spawned if there's a lot of uh action one spawned if there
3:48:05
wasn't that much action you would think the action one would have spawned you know yeah well Dan I know maybe you're
3:48:10
not up okay we we'll have to hold the memes uh we do have King in huge angle here but also closer in the front line
3:48:17
Pao is just being beat down right now but look at fer as well I mean bull also pretty strong H looking for the Q and
3:48:25
one more would have done it from the varis but it's not quite in range you know they have the pressure that
3:48:31
potentially you'd think a team could turn on a baron now but uh one of the problems is they bu the Aurora which is
3:48:37
a big tool but also that Baron damage is kind of just abysmal um between the
3:48:43
composition so yeah not really interested not really interested in being stuck in in a baron pit against uh
3:48:50
what the enemy team has so we SE hens he made a mistake of existing uh that was his problem uh didn't honestly didn't
3:48:57
have the backup from his team uh you can see no one's really that close to help him out but uh yeah Kon whiffing the AL
3:49:04
a bit and then King just just clinch damage like he ults and he hits two of
3:49:10
his harpoons and po nearly dies that's all he needs to do I mean I know the ult from Fisher hit as well but
3:49:16
still it's getting kind of crazy L hen's got to focus up as well
3:49:21
second time he's been caught kind of in a really random spot by Pao as well you
3:49:27
know just with the handshake this time around it was more of just the uh nocturn pressing R but you got to know
3:49:33
that they have nocturn right and you're alone like I'm going to be real in Solo qu you can def you see people play stuff
3:49:38
like I've seen Ekko support Silas support Leblon support Zoe support you kind of get fed you kind of do as much
3:49:45
damage as a real carry cuz you like 13 kills this doesn't happen in Pro play um you know like lens is building damage
3:49:51
I'm not saying he shouldn't be but his damage is not going to be comparable it's like closer who nearly has a rabbit
3:49:57
on completed so this is a very squishy elas who can't really oneshot anyone uh
3:50:03
compared to like you have your support item and you have Lich Bane and closer did just pick up the rabadon so it
3:50:10
uh might just turn into a cocoon bot yeah still doing a little bit of damage but uh definitely not the the most for
3:50:17
we pick at least for the early game we don't pick at least support for the late game is all I'm
3:50:22
saying yeah you pick it to uh put nocturn alt on cool down I guess uh but
3:50:28
it's back up because well experimental X plate and uh all that good jazz and its
3:50:33
not turn so and the Ultima Hunter you know I mean you'll have all the by now
3:50:38
it's always up yeah and now it's bro after basically losing the game for 30
3:50:44
minutes it feels like they're in control again in fness there's a lot of back and forth in those 30 minutes yeah it definitely
3:50:51
is is Lent towards Nong shim towards the later end but uh yeah uh hamach they know he's here
3:51:00
and at least they knew somebody was here and nice fear timing but now the Al's going to come in there's the Mel you got
3:51:07
to be careful not to go too deep for the nocturn as now closer threatening it going on in has the sonas just the
3:51:13
paranoia will he actually pull the trigger on it is the question not quite but the queue goes in and it's two kills
3:51:20
a two for one deal one to the vars but a me equalizer kingan and Fisher just burn
3:51:27
the entire team down and just like that you able to kite out Morgan and yeah
3:51:34
they'll they'll give it to fer he picks up a triple and just like that Nim still
3:51:40
in the driver's seat but kingan just waiting for his moment like his his at least dies I mean l has been doing that
3:51:46
a lot the said you he's like whatever waiting waiting and then he just absolutely eviscerates all of bro he
3:51:53
does not want to lose his game uh they are pondering going for this Baron now
3:51:58
uh H back so war will be a while before has this a war they know this is going on but they just don't have the members
3:52:04
there Morgan doesn't have TP he a while away and they do have a CL so they have a little bit of a secure without the
3:52:11
Smite um baru damage yeah yeah I mean this is King and just dead that was
3:52:17
extremely risky up against these two and they're still going they're still going and I mean okay it's going to go to the
3:52:23
kalista there you go they didn't lose all that much just King in ass Fisher nice Flash and nice little squeal
3:52:31
there Ox that was that was pretty cute that was actually Fisher we hit him oh wasn't me wasn't me sure sure sure that
3:52:37
was close you know uh with I I guess it's a takeway from
3:52:43
that situation um more gold to close it but honestly how much more gold can he can
3:52:49
get can he get well apparently a fair bit more and uh yeah this was such a such a messy chaotic fight which has
3:52:56
been the talking point of this game so far they kind of focus down a hand back get a bit of damage and they're like you
3:53:01
know what we can kill him they get the mes they get him low but yeah I mean this is the point of
3:53:07
view we want to see cuz the at least I mean the said one he gets focused down the at least just kind of passively dies
3:53:19
oh my God and with the Q from the small that hit as well uses the as well
3:53:28
have just so well played yeah really the timing you know you want to wait until
3:53:33
they overcommit so that there really is no Escape for them and they're all on
3:53:38
top of the per perfectly placed equalizer and really that's what kingan did so well there and they got hit by
3:53:44
the Q from fer as well like the sinking of the burning and the everything it was
3:53:49
H pretty brutal so now long fmly in control for now I say
3:53:56
firmly somewhat weak grasp you know yeah they should be in control they have control they've got butter on the hands
3:54:02
it's so sniffy uh well Morgan's dead and we
3:54:08
talked about this fish are extremely fed I mean you have double 80 carry you do have so many win conditions in the late
3:54:14
game for noin if they're in any kind of winning State they should be decently
3:54:21
happy and they are I would say at this point just about that decently happy
3:54:27
with the way things are going should be able to crack this inhibit a tower they are taking a decent amount of poke from
3:54:32
bull so I have to be somewhat careful um and it looks like that will be their signal to to knock away even though it's
3:54:39
Nong shim who have the execute from smolder it kind of feels like you get under a HP threshold hand back and
3:54:44
closer will just kill you um so you know definitely want to be a little bit concerned about those lower health bars
3:54:50
if he gets there Baron running out soon kingham was looking like he just wanted to roast someone um but will back away
3:54:55
he's level 18 uh Morgan three levels down so
3:55:01
feeling a bit rough yeah just finished a more and that feels bad because it's
3:55:08
only really kinging doing magic damage I'm not really counting L but uh having to buy a more specific cuz King is
3:55:15
roasting your whole team not ideal yeah especially when you're behind
3:55:20
you know it feels like sometimes building defensive items doesn't really matter cuz you might just die anyway they're going to try to pull the trigger
3:55:26
here onto the smoulder and that is not going to work comach especially with Gideon right
3:55:32
there CL are not in range help out oh slow okay flash comes out of bll gets
3:55:39
out I mean you're happy with that you know you got the flash from B it's an Al for Al both those Al pretty high value
3:55:45
but pretty short cool down now at this point of the game I mean hamack isn't level 16 yet but they'll probably both come up about roughly the same time but
3:55:52
one team got a flash the other team didn't Nong shim happy with that
3:55:58
trade definitely happy I I think you know again decently comfortable with where they are in this game but it is
3:56:05
still not over um they do have a very fed smolder Nim absolutely the favorites at this
3:56:11
point don't get me wrong yeah but the game hasn't been clean enough for me to say yeah Nim got it from here oh it's
3:56:19
certainly throwable absolutely throwable um you throw a fight bro get Cloud Soul uh
3:56:27
What uh that that felt I think he felt a bit too comfortable blast goinging in there is
3:56:33
all I'm going to say oh King is looking he is looking still looking uh that's a
3:56:38
nice onas lens's nearly dead boser going in he's landed and all Tomac is in that
3:56:43
back line they're looking for him they got the smoulder and finally we have The Equalizer but it might not matter it
3:56:49
doesn't really do enough damage they're at least able to kite out Morgan and they take him down King now flashing on
3:56:55
in hand shook but he goes inas and that might just be enough to burn damage is insane and this is full health and he's
3:57:02
bouncing so quickly at closer and B I would I wouldn't want to chase distance
3:57:09
yeah yeah I don't think they get anymore actually going to keep you out
3:57:15
goodbye kind of got a demonstration uh you know I think long sham managed to navigate that fight back quite well but
3:57:21
he he definitely saw how the game is throwable uh yeah one of the things is
3:57:27
King's equalizer was still slightly on cool down Len very aggressive he has
3:57:32
secet arm guard an Al uh and then they just dive in and it's a great Al for Morgan I think that was really the the
3:57:39
Lyn P of the situation is him connecting onto the smolder uh this underfed ambessa getting some things done but
3:57:46
unfortunately they kind of burn everything now King still strong J is still healthy and it was just a very dangerous
3:57:53
position to be in suo actually hand shook the rumble into range to then Zas
3:57:59
and burn them a little bit extra but to be fair you got to get them in range so that the vars and the the Aurora can
3:58:05
burn him down if he doesn't have the Zas but yeah very dicey
3:58:10
situation uh will go the way of no shim and they will take down this sixth Elemental dram there still a lot of
3:58:16
changes I feel like in The rosters for the these two teams but this is just everything I expected from n bro it's
3:58:22
delivering again is sure what what is happening the confidence he just dodged
3:58:28
everything duked them all B so being the old from Morgan the old from B hug being
3:58:34
his old I guess just just dodge it's that simple just flap it them I I don't know
3:58:42
and there you go no CL both dead I would imagine yeah they just pile all the El in onto him and Pao will follow up it
3:58:50
looks like Nim have finally figured it out for now as Fisher here in mid just
3:58:57
you know taking out the inhibitor while closer holds the wave it's only mispositioning if they can hit you with
3:59:03
stuff um and B learn that lesson pretty quickly is they can hit you with stuff now hand back all in 8 seconds they
3:59:10
don't have Vision but I presume there's like a blue trinket available can he steal it it's going to
3:59:15
be closer get Vision but it's too late too little too late Nim get the baron
3:59:21
and closer is spotted so maybe with the whole team you can take him down oh he
3:59:28
just Jed them oh oh wait no he's going back he went back to where they were
3:59:34
going keep running Closer by time this is good okay uh th000 gold for King as if
3:59:42
you needed that no it's 1,40 gold yeah I think that play would have been good if
3:59:49
kingan wasn't there and also you had a bit of an b a route but it was cute
3:59:55
getting over the wall uh yeah bull just dies no other way to spin it I wish we saw a replay of the the Fisher
4:00:03
footwork uh unfortunately not yeah uh and now TP coming in they want to make use of this pressure kingan
4:00:10
is there uh and we already have H down in the mid lane so bro is struggling right
4:00:16
now you know who else is definitely struggling right now who's that Deon is definitely struggling right now I can
4:00:23
picture his face on the desk in dism yeah it you know it's it's a slow burn
4:00:28
these Bro games these bro they gave you so much hope too but no were just better
4:00:33
that equalizer was not better yeah there's Deon there he is that really just sums up I imagined
4:00:42
him but you know bro maybe just giving us an extra game goes bro that's a very
4:00:48
nice Al looking for that backline but I don't think they have the damage okay Morgan going in uh he's going to send it
4:00:55
but that's about it as meanwhile leen's actually buying a lot of time here on the back line he'll get his own kill as
4:01:01
well just to die but yeah this game is over guys we had so many kills in this
4:01:07
one 44 by the end of it and Nim are the winners and provided quite the the
4:01:14
experience as well they certainly did I think we can all say we got a lot of experience from that game um it was very
4:01:21
back and forth neither team really came out with that one clean but n got the win uh they got one on the board and
4:01:27
things looking good for group Elder who already have a sizable lead but yeah h i mean I think stand out to the solo
4:01:33
laners for Nong shim kingan just toasting everyone and then
4:01:38
fer just playing with fire and not getting burned somehow uh uh I like how
4:01:44
you use that pun because he's a dragon that breathes fire yes he is thank you for noticing
4:01:51
yeah that was really good um wait the smolder or my my uh wood PL smolder oh
4:01:58
okay yeah smolder okay um but yeah it was pretty cool how he he flapped in all their faces and baited out three alts
4:02:04
and then bro like oh I guess we don't we can't do anything then you know what it's a lot of damage don't get me wrong
4:02:10
but I I honestly thought he might have broken like 50k he was just kind of toasting people but he definitely
4:02:15
deserving 42.1k damage uh closer though tried his hardest he really did so you
4:02:23
know hopefully he can the team can bounce back next game but he was he was not pulling punches that one eight and
4:02:28
zero legendary not enough for closer in this one typ experience typical all guys
4:02:35
we're going to take a break and we'll have the space with Deon to break it all down we'll see his reaction up next
4:03:23
you don't get that
4:04:00
spe
4:04:30
noxus is where the strong gather it seeks The Fearless and
4:04:39
defiant calling them here to answer one
4:04:44
simple question are you strong enough you say not afraid to
4:04:58
die but take off
4:05:08
the liing liing your BL do you believe
4:05:14
if it washes away take r as you can tell
4:05:29
you I like it when theks
4:05:38
through I like it when theks through the skin
4:05:53
theall of close and into the
4:05:59
fire again and drink it in I like it when f
4:06:13
yes
4:07:00
the the on BL to see on the
4:07:39
I like you want a fight Mar through the skin

fire again and drinking it I like you
4:08:09
the I like you the marks
4:08:40
count
4:08:45
every New Path seems to lead us closer to chaos perhaps we should focus on the
4:08:53
opportunity that's washed up on our Shores unforeseen turns are simply part
4:08:59
of any path yes but that darling is a step too
4:09:05
far even for us piltover was a lesson Vladimir Calamity is always appro ing in
4:09:15
some moments its arrival is more imminent than others our next move must be
4:09:21
Boulder not safer
4:10:02
hello everyone and welcome back to the space as it is the noodle Boys N shim up one Z over
4:10:10
Brion and it's just you just got to hold on to something something after a game like that because it was a nice back and
4:10:15
forth Affair the Bros were doing good but uh smolder is a champion that was on
4:10:21
the side of Nong Jim and it definitely helped out Deon alongside wolf and W did uh Gentlemen please help guide me
4:10:28
through that last game here we'll do our best uh so I wanted to highlight the Elise and the smolder pick I thought the
4:10:34
smolder pick was fairly risky into a draft that comes online very early you have a lot of skirmishing power with the
4:10:40
ambessa the Aurora early is going to be strong nocturn post six those early fights if R can set up some really nice
4:10:46
ones they have a lot of control they have the rata as well which is going to fall off in a game like this but can be quite strong early they kind of botched
4:10:52
some of those early fights the at least got a ton of value in the lane swap as well with electrocute just constantly
4:10:57
proing they really put Morgan behind and the draft that I was really worried about for Noam actually worked out way
4:11:03
better than expected yeah I think as you mentioned smolder need more time to be online right and I think uh that kind of
4:11:10
job was kind of completed by Kalisa and atast combo uh you already know that
4:11:15
Kalisa is one of the champion that when you want to open up your Champion uh sport champion pool is one of the pck
4:11:21
right and I think uh even though uh at the end lean said at least support sucks
4:11:27
uh I think he did his job completely yeah let's take a look at some of the highlights here highlight number one at
4:11:33
1750 in the mid lane here is a fight that just broke on out for both these
4:11:38
squads yeah I mean uh this is the comp that they were looking for a je was not
4:11:46
really be able to play the game correctly because of the nocturn but at the same time I mean uh it was really
4:11:53
easy to uh bro to play out this team comp uh but after you using all the
4:11:59
abilities on the target you have to get back after that yeah this was a really
4:12:05
awkward fight here where bro got greedy cuz I saw a window back in the game maybe we get a shut down on kingan but
4:12:11
yeah he's really strong at this point he ended up being the really big carry in this game obviously we saw the smolder
4:12:17
do a lot of damage later on but kingan was the real big threat in so many times we saw bro over index into trying to
4:12:23
take him out and completely failing and then he just got bigger and bigger and bigger his ults were massive in those
4:12:28
team fights later on I mean you just need to play on the knockdown ulti cool down you know after you use that knockdown ulti you have to chill a
4:12:34
little bit more and then you can play after but I think bro was kind of like rolling up yeah he was uh the big
4:12:40
beneficiary of the lane swap situation against Morgan uh was kinging let's take
4:12:46
a look at the next highlight in the mid lane uh very similar to what we saw in the first one it goes both ways but it
4:12:51
goes ultimately in the way of nim I mean there were so many messy fights uh during this game but when you think
4:12:59
about it Nim has some kind of St stability when it comes to the just
4:13:05
delayed fight because you have kalista you have smolder so when the fight goes longer then it's uh smolder FL favored
4:13:13
right so I think uh in general uh dony played really well and also on top of
4:13:19
that I think kingas Rumble was on fire yeah unfortunately Morgan just had a really rough game like he was put behind
4:13:24
super early by the lane Swap and then tried to make some heroic flanks and plays but he looked super uncomfortable
4:13:30
on the ambessa and that's kind of a worrying sign in a meta where she's so relevant was so relevant in keso cup
4:13:36
where they took the title as well but he's just not really finding his marks in these team fights yeah kingan just
4:13:41
hiding in the bush there able to come on out and and and really toast everyone he was very calm in the comms as we heard
4:13:48
in the POV speaking of POV here's that final play that we saw from fiser and it was a thing of beauty because if you've
4:13:54
been following the LOL e Sports website they or uh Twitter they put out a thing saying what resource is free and
4:14:00
everyone can use it movement and this is fantastic movement not one but two game
4:14:06
altering ultimates is he able to pick on out by just flapping his wings around and that then just gives Nong shim the
4:14:12
abil to close on the game he dodged the que as well remember that's with really not a whole lot of vision about where everyone is positioned if he gets caught
4:14:19
there that's maybe a window back into the game for bro so that was actually really nice movement from a player who has I think really struggled throughout
4:14:25
his time in the lck but is coming into his own a little bit the longer he's been here yeah I mean uh that kind of
4:14:31
play was kind of needed from Nim as well because they couldn't really finish out the game you know even though they were
4:14:37
really ahead in the game they couldn't actually finish the game but after that I think the game snowballed really well
4:14:43
that's right the Aurora on the opposite side closer did the most damage in the game uh was such a threat despite having
4:14:49
a smolder on the opposite side it made it a little bit harder however we talked about it in the last series blue side
4:14:55
has won majority of the matches it is definitely the side where most wins have come from the Bros will pick it now that
4:15:01
Aurora's gone and Bess is gone these are a couple Champions that have been uh uh very very important throughout drafts
4:15:08
what do you want to see here from the side of bros I as far as I can tell bull is not getting subbed out to play through bottom Lane that's been his
4:15:14
whole identity as a player get ahead early snowball that's the Bros mm Mo all
4:15:20
right well if you are a fan of group Baron that's ut1 and hanw life Esports
4:15:26
and B uh bfx and uh the freaks you need the Bros to come on back this is the
4:15:32
whole cool part of the lck cup cheering for your teams but if you want to make it straight onto the playoffs you're
4:15:38
looking for the Nong shim win who will get it let's find out together
4:15:43
thank you guys as wow let's go bro and from New York City that's from yeah
4:15:49
you're from New York City wow also Spider-Man oh yeah true he is from New
4:15:55
York so many people from New York City wow um yeah shout out to a couple of Giga Chads that came down to watch the
4:16:01
games I do you want to have you met Spider-Man but you're from New
4:16:07
York I've seen him before Oh you hung out yeah he's too cool for me though oh yeah yeah I
4:16:14
I left as well in uh 2012 so oh yeah
4:16:19
unfortunate not a lot of time to hang out with the with good old Spider-Man of course uh let's get into the draft here
4:16:26
as bro have selected the blue side will it help them I am curious to see yeah I
4:16:32
mean I think kind of going off what the space was saying about uh playing around bull playing around his agressive picks
4:16:38
they could have like opted for the Draven before the second rotation before it got banned so maybe more emphasis on
4:16:44
getting bull a pick where they can really play around him snowball him get him ahead uh cuz the varus I mean I
4:16:50
don't think he played it badly but it didn't really feel as relevant as some of the other picks we saw when he did
4:16:55
make his debut in the lck and sadly with the clist being picked by Nong shim he won't get a
4:17:02
chance to play that this series at all yeah it's just not going to happen
4:17:07
and it's not really a good reason to play Draven uh as well because of that uh Yi still open
4:17:15
yeah I feel like you have to ban yon into closer I don't really see a good reason not
4:17:20
to yeah um I would definitely
4:17:26
just wow I mean I I guess do bro just face pick yon for closer it makes sense
4:17:33
no they go CI
4:17:38
interesting just that just doesn't I I yeah I don't know
4:17:44
I okay I mean bro clearly put a lot of value on it since they banned it in the last draft um I mean this just like cork
4:17:52
is pretty good but he's not yon and then just the Renekton ban as well like the Lord getting all that respect I feel
4:17:59
like Renekton is actually pretty strong especially on to take out like uh gante and Rumble especially played in the last
4:18:08
game J right best has gone as well yeah but but like it's yon do we just not do
4:18:15
this team just not want to play yon I mean yon is pretty good to a so if you put the Cory Bard Ro could just take y
4:18:22
here still it's still possible it's still within the
4:18:28
powers very much playing uh you know two picks that do well at disengaging with yair and and the maokai so to see what
4:18:35
they pair that up with they want to play more longer range comp uh and play the distance we'll see what bull just got
4:18:42
the news that he's playing that he's playing corki is that okay yeah I can do that he literally said
4:18:48
okay how did you know um so yeah no uh well y didn't get selected so it might
4:18:55
still be mid uh Air versus corki you thought that you could avoid it 2025 was
4:19:01
a new year new meta new me you know we'll be casting like 2025 you know
4:19:07
we'll be you'll have grandchildren by then no you'll have one of those you know those
4:19:12
Rising like uh seats that old people have to get upstairs yeah yeah oh is if
4:19:18
is quy again let's be real it'll just be our replicated images uh you know right
4:19:25
it'll be like AI that casts instead of us I mean we with our image and likeness
4:19:30
we already AI Caston there's a look behind the kitten that's true that's true uh ax has been watching his uh
4:19:37
Challenger League from 2022 I think
4:19:43
so y they remember y totally ignored and then banned because it was just not PRI
4:19:49
at all for some reason IM close just just like wait a minute we could have played it damn unlucky well
4:19:56
unfortunately they don't get the opportunity also they've done this thing again where they have the Zyra into the ash which is a little bit painful there
4:20:03
isn't as much follow up with it I think the Leona denial denial is pretty big because Leona and ashel against ayra is
4:20:10
just really painful we saw that in game one of Genji Han life he Sports early today not a fun time uh that was peanut
4:20:17
uh B going to be denied so not want to give them that pairing the fard Duo and
4:20:23
now you direct more bands towards you maybe you could throw some towards King
4:20:29
no going for the MF so I mean MF zyro Leon is a pretty strong
4:20:34
Trio could definitely make things difficult for jiu we will see uh it still feels like
4:20:40
it's kind of up in the air where that cor is going I think that is the thing that is very clear yeah I mean bull already said okay so maybe it'll be him
4:20:51
you know Corky Leona can can work down the bottom side Nautilus also banned away as we get further and further into
4:20:58
the bandless with our new Fearless format here for the LSK cup alist still
4:21:04
available so is sarapen and ra these are champions that are available I'm glad
4:21:10
Len is demonstrated just go for the ra here uh I think personally I think alist
4:21:15
makes more sense specifically into Leona but you know still have that engage Potential from the ra uh did get changed
4:21:23
a bit between last year and this year uh some tweaks with the kit uh looking at the Jacks potentially
4:21:31
for Morgan yeah I mean there's just really not a lot of threats and blind jcks used
4:21:37
to be a thing that we did when there were a lot of threats and this are so many top laners taking off the cards exactly
4:21:43
um also going to make it really difficult for J in general it's it's a hard game to play Ash cuz you want to be
4:21:49
able to Auto attack but not many targets you can connect those Autos onto ezel going to come through finally for bows
4:21:55
so it is going to be that Cory in the mid lane um some strong two item spikes to play around they already have the AP
4:22:01
from that Zyra uh
4:22:08
yeah yeah potentially should oh uh it's definitely a different angle here
4:22:15
going with the gang plank I kind of like it honestly I feel like they have the setup already they
4:22:21
have CC from the rest of the composition uh the GPL is also really powerful against like like a Zyra just dropping
4:22:27
that down and she she's so immobile so difficult to play around and it gives you a bit more of a scaling element I
4:22:33
feel like both of these compositions had a lot of like late game o freely like the corki eal Zyra ja and I think if you
4:22:41
went something like the gragas Maybe could struggle on those later team fights a little bit so giving a third carry to King and honestly considering
4:22:47
the performance kingan play on last game I think he deserves a carry sure I mean he got one he did well
4:22:54
give him another uh we know this is going late because it is a brown oim series and we already had one 40-minute
4:23:01
game so uh he did it immediately he was hyped he
4:23:09
was ready he's been waiting for this moment all day because uh he's basically
4:23:14
meing the fact that Len's name is Shu and J's jiu so and then you you also
4:23:22
have shiu I'm glad you you explained the also cuz cuz I was think like I was like
4:23:27
DK on play yeah you know I was like no I get I I I understand now we
4:23:34
got another Su over here he's just not it's not his ID it's lens actually
4:23:39
um so here we go anyway we got a couple of scaling comps and we'll see who can go the longest as we get on to the rift
4:23:47
for game number
4:24:02
two you know I noticed the Corky skin that is being used a little POA one
4:24:08
there the the the the dog has an eye patch um yeah just is that unique to that
4:24:16
chroma is it cuz he's a pirate I don't know if you saw but I saw when they were loading in I didn't see
4:24:22
it but I think it is unique to that
4:24:29
oh getting the mile knows how to play Gangplank yeah I'm just wondering if there's like some LW behind that you
4:24:36
know specifically why does this Papa have a have a an eye patch Caitlin has
4:24:42
an eye patch probably because either maybe he got lasic or eye surgery in one
4:24:49
eye instead of two yeah only could afford onee at a time yeah maybe he's
4:24:55
saving up or he's a pirate there's only two choices I like the fire options
4:25:00
better it's really hard Roi see because he TS so quickly when you're looking maybe if he stands still we I feel like
4:25:07
a pirate dog would be pretty useful though right it' be pretty cool as well you just have him on ship keeps company
4:25:13
of all the other you know human Pirates and stuff and can do stuff like sparking
4:25:18
at the people you're robbing and I I don't know I I think it's it's not quite like a cat who kind of like
4:25:25
keeps you know the the rats from infesting the ship and stuff like that maybe there's also a pirate rat or not
4:25:31
rat cat you've told me if I become a pirate and also a pirate rat yeah maybe if I become a pirate I'll get a dog
4:25:36
you've sold me on it all right thank you for that so that's your next uh career
4:25:41
change you're not going to be I'm not saying I'm going to I'm just saying if you know if it happens
4:25:49
spontaneously without me leaning that direction in anyway what if you don't become a pirate well then I don't have
4:25:55
to worry about that but this is why we have hypotheticals Brendon just in case I thought maybe you were going to be
4:26:00
like well I'll get a I'll get a doggy anyway um I don't think I really
4:26:06
have space in my apartment um maybe next one maybe next one yeah yeah you got to
4:26:13
you got to do the slow Korea upgrade you know start off with the smaller one and then you you know slowly build up is
4:26:19
that specific to Korea yeah don't people just do that in general as you get more money oh the spite fight Gideon going to
4:26:27
win it humach level three Zyra not able to get the job done Gan even flashing the emote yep
4:26:36
yeah he knows he won the mental battle hamack walked all the way into his jungle to lose it oh
4:26:42
yeah well can just do that there is a lot of pressure going in
4:26:48
favor of bro bot Lane here so definitely nice for
4:26:53
them uh maybe a couple more Q's hit from bll could force it you out the lane now
4:26:59
Gideon is going to secure SK crab hand back a little bit behind cuz he went for that big
4:27:05
detour yeah you don't necessarily have to do that against Malai but uh
4:27:10
certainly a faster clear than maai so you can and it it can absolutely pay off
4:27:16
by going for a three buff and just getting the maai a little bit behind getting herself extra fed Morgan
4:27:22
struggling a little bit here yeah you know honestly I feel like early game maai CL is still still pretty fast uh
4:27:29
it's just not Zyra yeah but I think honestly Zyra really starts to gain momentum a little lit like you can definitely do stuff once you've done the
4:27:35
full clear but I think we have seen maokai kind of keep Pace early it's just once you start to get once you like the
4:27:41
fade of that es and stuff you kind of just melt everything mhm um uh there's no
4:27:48
way there's no way there's no way there's no way I would way I've seen
4:27:53
people call an FF just just quit the game I have seen I've seen you lost the
4:27:59
buff you lost that I've seen people all F four for left that is a heart breaker for hamach um I know he's a rookie he's
4:28:07
just coming in he's like I'm having a great time in the lck then something like this happens ruin his day his week
4:28:13
maybe his his split hopefully not his split um but yeah that was a tilter and Morgan just missed a melee minion less
4:28:19
of a tilter it was there's no splits in the lck Cup by the way true nor is it called a split yeah
4:28:27
well I guess hanack is safe though well we got an engage here onto an Ezreal can be dangerous even dropping
4:28:34
the ignite maybe just a bit of pressure uh they also do get the cleanse so not
4:28:40
half bad diding a pretty good job finding an angle there and I don't really think oh Morgan he wants that
4:28:48
demolish and that plate yeah not much King can do to really force him off kind of feels like
4:28:54
this game is very much one of those old school traditional classic bro game where both teams they're kind of
4:29:02
fing out what do we call them bro and Brew oh W there we go yeah that's where you sit back and uh you have your Brew
4:29:09
of choice whatever it is I know for o it's uh always water you don't drink anything else I don't think I've ever
4:29:15
seen you drink anything else I mean that's not strictly true that's not true yet I've partaken in alcohol before that
4:29:21
is true it's crazy to say I have seen I am just a normal water guy yeah Guinness
4:29:27
Jon said you know yep it's cuz you're half Irish H
4:29:34
right quish grny is IR still counts still counts I have the passport you
4:29:39
know dagda always says it dagda says it count okay does this mean that I'm more Irish than you how Irish are you how
4:29:47
well then yeah you're more Irish than me but you're actually from there like
4:29:52
not from Ireland but like from that part of the world I'm sadly from the other place I'm from New York City and I'm
4:29:58
more Irish than ax who sounds more Irish than but I have the passp so you do have
4:30:03
the passport yeah yeah I think there's technically a way for me to get it h I'm pretty sure there would be at
4:30:10
this point though I probably for the queen maybe that maybe that can be the focus of this cast buying Morgan he
4:30:17
thought he was safe and maybe he is he is he's fine totally fine yeah baits out expertly the ultimate uh does have to
4:30:24
pay his flash for that but you know it's just like paying the Bro tax everybody's happy to pay the Bro tax H is level five
4:30:31
yeah this is a remind if you haven't paid your bro tax yeah go ahead and do that right now there's the oranges he's totally fine just a bit of pressure to
4:30:39
get their bottom Lane up there and start hitting that turret really that's what it's about yeah both teams trying to put
4:30:46
some pressure on these structures bro uh decent amount of head and they have the three grubs so they're definitely
4:30:52
getting some good mileage on this Tower meanwhile long shim mostly just
4:30:58
clearing out the minions they are looking for Morgan he will do that thing where he presses
4:31:04
Q nice try guys I mean you you got him down you got you chunked him have 40% of
4:31:10
his health I I think it's just funny that all the damage needs to come from guu and I don't know if you know much about Ash but she's very Auto attack
4:31:16
based and I don't know if you know much about Jax but he has this ability why is he still okay he might die now actually
4:31:24
um in a bit of trouble in a lot of trouble yeah he's he's dead um that's going to be first Blood given over to
4:31:30
Nim first turret did go to Bro in the Top Lane so Bull's getting a lot of free
4:31:35
time by himself farming gets a lot of plates and I he's just been a generous gig Morgan's like you know what I feel
4:31:41
bad you guys didn't get the kill here you go it's on me it's on the house you
4:31:46
guys need this you know like you didn't have enough of a lead last time it was you guys need Fierce blood to contribute
4:31:51
towards the feat of strength um yeah whereas we do not because we're
4:31:57
Chads we focus on more important things like objectives and turrets yeah kills
4:32:02
kills are kind of cringe um they are pretty cringe yeah yeah he
4:32:08
just I guess he just thought they they they left he couldn't see he could see them anymore yeah obviously they left
4:32:15
yeah yeah uh I mean he could have got those three cast Minions on that melee
4:32:20
minion so it was pretty worth if he if he' gotten the minions you know yeah um
4:32:25
oh well never change Morgan never change yeah we've seen worse he's it's funny
4:32:31
he's in a better position in this game than the last one he is he actually oh he's 11 Gold ahead he's now three gold
4:32:37
down 17 gold down when you said 11 Gold ahead I'm like how do you know he's go exactly and
4:32:46
oh he's down oh he's up oh he's up even more he's he's winning and then I was going to say look at his re our really
4:32:52
cool new overlay where we have the money difference in the middle oh man he's he's 65 gold up things are going great
4:33:00
honestly things things couldn't be oh he's down never mind never mindell cell cell cell
4:33:06
cell well speaking of that uh we are having a fight here over the red buff which is going to
4:33:13
leash and here comes an arrow oh that was so
4:33:18
close and maybe if he had the streamer client that would have hit uh oh very nice angle here trying to get in but
4:33:24
Paulo just just gets out of that one as he's able to cancel it out by just
4:33:29
tagging himself onto the azir taxiing his way back over and it's actually just
4:33:35
Fisher who's got a big bit of uh egg on his face we've seen some phenomenal uh AIA shuffles in our time in the that
4:33:42
wasn't one of them um that was unfortunate uh people flashed out po just kind of buffered it and uh
4:33:49
Fisher he tried and I mean I guess the Saving Grace is that Morgan is now like
4:33:56
70 oh he's 60 Gold down so top Lan's going better um yeah this was a very K
4:34:04
fight over just a red buff the AL for he missed I think it's a decent angled aim for sadly maybe if someone CC initially
4:34:10
as he was coming in watch P Watch watch how Pao Dodges this yeah he e it's pretty nice but it's also
4:34:15
like it was ambitious P fisha it was ambitious yeah I mean they had the kind
4:34:21
of barrage and they were like oh maybe we've got the damage but if they have sus and you're azir level 9 you
4:34:29
know you don't even have a a full item in the enemy jungle a six
4:34:34
grubber a six grubber that's what I said that's a lot
4:34:40
of grubs they are grubbed up and now if they get his Dragon set up they have feat of
4:34:46
strength they have all the feet Yes uh thank you for clarifying
4:34:51
that yeah very important and I mean they're in a pretty
4:34:57
good spot that Arrow's going to hit just going to get a Clans at a both pretty nice to make sure that they're keeping
4:35:03
that Clans on cool down Morgan I mean he's just standad here
4:35:10
taking q's and Barrel to the face I mean he's going to be fine but like he's
4:35:15
taking so much damage get XP he's a glutton for punishment he knew he could take it okay he's like hit me he knows
4:35:21
his lemons hit me honestly I I feel like that's kind of
4:35:28
mind gaming kingan kingan's like man this guy can take a beaten he's an absolute insane person like how can I
4:35:35
play against this guy it's like the scene in Fight Club where they f
4:35:40
you ah this guy is's really something uh B doesn't have Aran shift he took a lot
4:35:46
of damage I yeah I guess he this is just the Bro way it's just Morgan where you going buddy they're just taking hits
4:35:53
right to prove they can cuz they Giga Chads that's that's what we're seeing from both B and Morgan maybe they're
4:35:59
amping each other up they're like yo look how much damage I just took and both's like no no no I can do more look at this look how close I am to
4:36:07
dying it it was pretty cool honestly I I did like how close you got dying without
4:36:12
dying yeah people love death defying stuns and that's what they're doing right now on summon his Rift it's pretty
4:36:18
cool it's free entertainment I believe the term we use is rad for these sort of
4:36:23
rad yeah sure for radical yeah
4:36:29
um yeah sadly the you should bring that back honestly radical we should say that
4:36:34
more often how often is more often like a lot or just you know every now and
4:36:39
then sprinkle it in should say about as much as as often as you say
4:36:44
Neato maybe replace Neato with rad I I do like
4:36:52
Neato okay setting up for the dragon uh think we'll get a Rus Aon in this game
4:36:58
uh B he just tanks it you know he's like hey look I'm totally fine I don't even need cleanse he's build different he's
4:37:05
that guy yeah it does take a lot of damage um which generally is an ideal for an
4:37:12
objective but it's the Bro way um it's okay because they're generally Giga
4:37:19
Chads GG that is them they are getting some good damage on this Tower though and Nim
4:37:25
AR really they're kind of freaked out at this point uh how bro behaving so they they're not really comfortable going for
4:37:31
the dragon yeah I mean I I would be a bit spooked as well yeah this is kind of
4:37:38
it's getting kind of too much this is unprecedented honestly now because bro have generously said okay you can take
4:37:45
the dragon um Nim will take it yeah so after this Dragon they get secured if you look at the fre strength counter
4:37:52
they'll be completely even and I I think bro just wants they want a fair fight Harald in a minute 30 they're ready to
4:37:57
throw down when it takes all yeah I mean bro would never take advantage of
4:38:02
another team by no no no that' be po po it's got to be an
4:38:10
even playing fields uh at all times that's why when they're ahead generally you know it becomes a more even game and
4:38:16
that's why the games last so long as well they where we have bro and Brew in kind of conversations it's just love for
4:38:22
the game honestly all these you know everyone's like yeah Genji like playing League of Legends do they they try and
4:38:28
finish the game quickly is that a love for the game you're playing they twoed earlier you know it's
4:38:34
not the same they wanted to get out yeah bro is giving you that extra content yep yep they know what the viewers want they
4:38:41
know what the they want that Slow Burn close win in 45 minutes rather than
4:38:46
like the quick one you know you want to keep you want to keep the fans guessing you want to keep it interesting exactly
4:38:52
if you just win immediately it's like oh well we knew you were going to win keep you on the edge of the for the very end
4:38:58
yeah I liked that Barrel angle that was cool yeah we do see L hens barreling
4:39:04
down towards Vault Lane you've outdone yourself uh Canon
4:39:10
barage going to come down here he's got barrels that wave is gone uh can they kill him through this poo is dead and
4:39:16
kingan says well I'm just going to try to just run away from this and make sure
4:39:22
that I don't give as many assists possible and run away from the third also saves his flash H doesn't even know
4:39:28
he's dead anyway but we love a generous gachard um bro should be able to pick up
4:39:34
that bot Tower with corki there B I think can defend this the mini wave
4:39:39
is pretty small and they're not really pressuring it so yeah should be good yeah trade up for bro uh but he
4:39:47
lose to top top so I guess he's in trade for bro it's always been even oh but the Herold this is the this
4:39:54
is the All or nothing this is where they give a little bit of a you know it's like giving them
4:40:00
a little bit of a in into the game they're like okay you can have the feed strength no no no they have to fight it
4:40:06
come on come on bro this is what it's been waken up to yeah this is a show
4:40:12
this is the bro down Gideon has been you know frightened
4:40:17
by the play so far Pao getting kited out here and yeah Gideon he he had enough he
4:40:23
just ran away wait kingan's not here he does have TP but he's not here and he
4:40:28
doesn't have ultimate so maybe bro just take this yeah I no I think you shouldn't
4:40:36
take a page out of bros handbook this time around you should definitely fight over this a huge objective with the be
4:40:43
strength King and just killing the turret instead and Z has cleans so they're just going to give it away you
4:40:49
know what Nim they saw the Reddit post where someone was like the gold value of of
4:40:55
Patza strength is really low now and if you saw that was on the front page like yeah people are getting people are
4:41:01
falling for it if you look at the math n stream did the math thrower just Vibes I like we want the feature strength cuz
4:41:06
they're cool you know look at my new look at my new Jordans it's new to 2025
4:41:12
check out my new shoes bro that they're just mogging nction right now oh man this game is really delivered
4:41:21
18 minutes two and two this is the lck I stand up oh I was about to check which
4:41:26
out count we have we went in a replay we'll have to check out no idea what it could be yeah probably just got
4:41:32
absolutely uh blasted there by the gang Cline quite heavily nothing else to say on our
4:41:38
situation um yeah game's still very even uh and
4:41:43
you know maybe it was a situation where bro said hey look we'll give you uh the
4:41:48
dragon but IM we won something later and N like absolutely and then later
4:41:54
was the ri p n like oh man uh wasn't a good
4:41:59
deal pretty good trade for bro I'd say I mean bro took a they they took a good deal I think they they navigated it well
4:42:06
they are down in Dragon so it's oce Soul though ocean soul coming not the I mean
4:42:13
you definitely could take it but it's not the most impactful Soul yeah might as well I love how we
4:42:21
talk about pza strength and dragon soul soul Fe yeah that's cool uh we have
4:42:26
Paulo in a bit of trouble but he is Leona they are doing everything they can to take him out and he will go down but
4:42:32
Gideon is to trade and leens as well so bro do fight back and here comes fiser going to get the flash out of Morgan
4:42:38
kingan says thank you very much I will clean that up and pick up a kill for myself du dodging
4:42:44
everything not actually intending on fighting he's just going in to make some cool Dodges it's just mind gaming at
4:42:51
this point the E forward bit a oh he took that one Gatling gun kingan's still here
4:42:58
so is Fisher yeah I don't think he can go up for that turret Scrappy uh I think is the way to
4:43:04
describe that but we have a lot more kills now I guess and N just heading over the dragon double The
4:43:09
Kills that's some quick MTH yeah uh yeah this should be secured by Nim no
4:43:15
real I mean maybe a steal from closer no they're going to wait for the
4:43:21
jungler yeah that's no fun oh what what
4:43:26
uh okay uh so closer generously going to
4:43:31
hand his uh his flash over bit of damage going to delay the back here yeah Clos
4:43:38
taking a page out of the Zea book of Cory Valk well Aon actually spawned on the bottom
4:43:44
side of the map this time oh neat oh do we get a verification on which Aon it is
4:43:49
it's off I can't see it's off the screen I don't know it's impossible to tell yeah there no no way of
4:43:58
knowing uh for you guys who may not know uh the Red symbol is fous
4:44:04
atakan um so yeah what's the symbol for ruin we don't know no idea I've never it
4:44:10
uh actually we you and I were doing the season opening events um and we saw it there yeah but that doesn't count that's
4:44:17
not they also KCK up that's true we haven't seen it at this event yeah uh yeah po just he just kind of takes it
4:44:23
you know if he lived he would have won the title for taking the biggest beating on bro uh for unfortunately goes down
4:44:29
but then nice little fake out from Fisher pretending he's going to go for the shuffle but then doesn't uh and just kind of Mind Games
4:44:38
Morgan if Morgan had just kind of stood there there and and taking it that would that would pretty gig shot yeah um that
4:44:45
respect absolutely Arrow going to sail wide and now they're re-engaging this is a very squishy ra but now the engage
4:44:52
coming in from Gideon tons of damage on the hok and now Fisher he's desperately still finding the azir angle he can't
4:44:59
find a single one in this game and it's not going to happen again you know I
4:45:05
just maybe just just sit back and do damage you know that is something you can do in his AIA uh
4:45:12
Fisher yeah a little bit of a swing on a Miss on that one uh but it's still a
4:45:18
close game still a close game bro edging ahead uh and we see po taking a bit of
4:45:24
poke there the arrow unfortunately misses and ends up being hamack who gets caught out by the Maly knocked in bit
4:45:33
overextended and In fairness there was a good play from Paul I I think we can say that closer dashed away po instantly
4:45:40
like jumped in uh flashed into to stun Fisher but uh yeah maybe just hang
4:45:47
back fer uh sitting at 7K damage still he's looking for that
4:45:53
inspiration you know he needs to watch some more bd/ chovy Faker vods yeah he's
4:46:00
just he's running through you know the I mean we all know the world clip against R from fake he's like that could be me
4:46:07
I'm that he's hyping himself up he's like I'm that guy it keep practicing you know yeah you can only maybe one day he
4:46:13
will be there yeah maybe we'll show clips from this game if he gets some sick ult like that you know maybe it's
4:46:20
like a wolves winning ult we be like this is where he started now he's here oh nice little angle from Fisher that's
4:46:26
a nice amount of harass damage now Paulo in a rough spot in the first out of the two of them they just pop like balloons
4:46:33
and now bro have no chance of going for this anakan still ahead on gold but that
4:46:38
doesn't matter in this game let's be real yeah long shim able to Kure The Vicious atakan and this is a pretty huge
4:46:45
buff to get just good play no one went for any unnecessary shuffles and they just cleaned up on
4:46:51
bro uh and now it's kind of one these situations as well there's a lot of structures up um for
4:46:59
row but actually if we look at the timing there's going to be some overlap with
4:47:05
the vicious buff and the baron so we'll talk about that after right now po just getting chunks King doing so much damage
4:47:12
once again this guy is just an absolute machine uh they do manage to to run away with a few members left but yes so we
4:47:19
can see racious buff is about 2 minutes they're going to likely use that to take some structures but Baron's spawning in
4:47:24
a minute so you have time take a bit of structures reset get back on the map start the baron up while you still have
4:47:30
the buff and you can just chain it that would be ideal yeah we'll see if they look to do that the only issue is if you
4:47:37
you know you keep the buff and you get wiped on Baron and you end up just you know you respawn but you also give the
4:47:45
baron over you know in some like weird scenario my advice is don't do that um
4:47:50
don't don't die on Baron and give them Baron yeah that's uh something to be
4:47:55
avoided I would say yeah at bro are just
4:48:01
unwavering they are going in they are going in they don't care about revives
4:48:07
you think they care about the new the new rules of the rift no absolutely not
4:48:13
um and Fisher still looking for it he is going to get the kill at least but he is
4:48:19
feeling a little bit shy about his Al at this point in time and that's that's fair that's fine see this is the difference between bro and other
4:48:25
teams is that other teams will kill you for gold so when you have the racious buff or they kill you for Tempo so
4:48:32
they're not interested in killing you when you have the buff but bro a different they're killing you for the pride so they'll engage regardless um
4:48:38
unfortunately that didn't pan out for them now ocean soul going over to Nim uh which will help mitigate some of the the
4:48:44
Poke harass I mean there is a decent amount on bro like the the damage from the Zyra plans the Cory the Ezreal uh
4:48:50
bull is fine uh but yeah uh I feel like honestly
4:48:56
n could just move towards the baron they have still some time on the buff they have ocean soul so they can sustain up I
4:49:02
think this is just a play yeah you might as well I I don't
4:49:07
you know unless something goes incredibly wrong uh you should be totally fine to take this one down as
4:49:13
the Ezreal going to do a bit of damage maybe looking for the steel here as hok but he's late now looking to take him
4:49:19
down lens gets a decent angle with that one but the knock up from the zyro AL is actually doing pretty well to this
4:49:25
Frontline bro trying to get as much as they possibly can they're going to get two kills and maybe a bit more here
4:49:31
flash on in from Morgan very nice as kingan maybe a bit too scary for them so
4:49:37
he's going to get away yeah adakam buff faded off Midway through that so G will got the res lens and fer didn't so two
4:49:44
Baron Buffs taken down uh and a bit of gold in favor this game still Incredibly
4:49:49
Close uh but there is Baron in favor of nim they have a decent amount of those Buffs kingan get stacked up has another
4:49:55
uh 500 uh the coins silver serpent for an upgrade we'll see the fight here just
4:50:01
very aggressive positioning and there's just enough damage to shred through po at this point
4:50:08
and Morgan also getting pretty shredded just a lot of damage coming out from long stream and if you don't get onto
4:50:13
those key carries they will just keep pummeling away you now this one the uh ult from Zyra doing so much
4:50:20
work here just shredding jiu uh and you can see in the mix lens gets chunked
4:50:26
out the Zyra really actually starting to put some numbers in and and Morgan he's
4:50:33
online he is uh on the internet yes he is playing with the rest of the team uh
4:50:38
doing that so that that is true and with three Baron Buffs especially on kingan
4:50:46
oh you know Arrow accuracy in the first series of the day was a little bit
4:50:52
higher than we've had in this do so far in this game we are feeling it but yeah it's so
4:50:58
difficult to engage into this maai as that is a massive zyro ultimate though going to knock up four of them and now
4:51:04
bit of damage coming in the Poke as well from the Ezreal you see Fisher he's listening you know he's sitting back
4:51:10
he's got so in position he's doing damage he's not overextending if he just doesn't go in and try and Shuffle it's
4:51:17
winning just avoid the age that's all you have to do and bull got a huge two shot barage there hit like well hit four
4:51:23
people but just the ocean saw meaning they can sustain back up is kind of making things a little bit tricky right
4:51:30
now now looking to oh Morgan there's a
4:51:36
TP it's air it's so op it's so op when you do out instead of in it's just not
4:51:42
balanced yeah it's crazy oh they're in trouble flank Corky it's coming in we saw flank Victor
4:51:50
the FY not not going to work not going to do anything um I was a bigger fan of the
4:51:58
the flickor flick personally yeah Faker did a great job on that one that was pretty good yeah I do like the name Floy
4:52:05
though I flick is good too I think they're both pretty good
4:52:11
always flanking and so is PBE still flanking to this day yeah
4:52:18
um uh going take a blue buff and actually maybe a Zyra as well hak just
4:52:23
kind of going for a little walk in the uh in the jungle find some enemies he
4:52:29
was so nonchalant about it as well it wasn't like he was kind of cautiously moving up he was like you know this am a
4:52:34
I'm a plant this this jungle is full of plants is my place to be he actually died CL maai is also yeah
4:52:42
so maybe learning some lessons about fora there you go well here's the engage
4:52:49
onto Eclipse Leona they don't seem to care though because they have enough damage they're far enough ahead and the
4:52:55
zoning is huge with the barrels and the canabar so there you go Nim just kind of
4:53:01
taking whatever they want at this point looking for the inhibitor in the Top Lane closer
4:53:08
desperately telling them to back off and they will they'll only take the
4:53:13
inhibitor keep the pressure up though crazy you know this game was very back and forth bro got that I feel like had
4:53:20
the edge at one point and now nongin really starting to put it away uh yeah po just isn't tanky anymore he kind of I
4:53:27
mean he just last a decent amount of time but they they're shredding so Qui they doing so much damage yeah King is
4:53:33
just getting barrels off and he is very far ahead of Morgan
4:53:39
you know we we watching the the economy between the top laners was like a little bit back and forth you know uh if you
4:53:46
did sell your Morgan coin then you you'll have done youve avoided a bit of
4:53:51
a disaster great timing that's all I'm going to say um everyone sometimes it's about cutting your losses yeah if
4:53:57
everyone who didn't then uh you know invest in silver if you invest in silver serpents you're doing phenomenal yeah
4:54:05
um that that was truly the currency that went to the Moon
4:54:11
well maybe next time the arrow this time is going to hit J is also going to tank it up like a gachan himself he's going
4:54:18
to go down and so is lens and all of a sudden bro get a couple of kills and
4:54:24
Elder's up in 10 seconds it's winable how is this happening it's just another bro oh that
4:54:31
didn't do as much damage as I thought it would yeah all I guess not not quite the uh
4:54:38
Tempo he was looking for that did a lot more yeah yeah a lot that was
4:54:43
Leona yeah the crit I guess uh 3v4 jungler's
4:54:50
both up let's see what happens I Believe In N oh the timing Fisher he finally
4:54:55
figured it out it was perfect when he needed it most and he lives until the
4:55:01
very end until he dies but kingan still here bro he's like I'm going to solo
4:55:06
this you can't solo this wait he's he's TP in the end he's TP he's going he's going into the way
4:55:13
there wait the yelda I don't think B's like wait you have Smite oh no what am I going to do
4:55:21
I'm dying what is going on okay they got the Elder they got the Elder honestly kingan
4:55:27
should have just stayed really really yeah instead of no
4:55:34
no no stop play but like challenge me I dare you yeah that would been fun um
4:55:40
yeah yeah J he's feeling himself he eats everything cleanses and still dies not
4:55:46
ideal um a lot of damage coming out from King and in return but the ocean soul is
4:55:51
so annoying in these extended Miss yeah that was definitely Crea a lot of damage there t comes in and then fer look at
4:55:58
the timing someone said to fer just never try and go in again just just all
4:56:03
defensively and he does and then you know what he does he goes in he's like I've proven myself I'm
4:56:10
allowed to go in and you know it works out pretty okay he did some damage he even flashed defensively I'm so proud of
4:56:17
him and the baron does go the way of nim here there was a Ezreal ult that
4:56:22
happened and it was kind of close but we're we're not in that year anymore
4:56:28
where Ezreal old steals happen so so they have Baron they have Elder they
4:56:33
have ocean soul Exodia they have a lot of stuff but do they have the power of
4:56:39
friendship I mean maybe not as much as bro but I think I think they'll take the 20
4:56:45
instead I I think they'll be happy with it this time around for him oh the arrow this time going to connect onalo and the
4:56:52
engage is clean as well lens's getting it done at the very end as Morgan as
4:56:58
well just being burned to a crisp the Elder Dragon is too strong and Nim are too strong tonight as they will take the
4:57:05
two over the Bros the generous gigachad will give it to them this time and know
4:57:10
Sim with this roster with this new roster we were expecting some good stuff to happen they finally get it done here
4:57:17
in their second series of LC cast yeah King looked like a really good pickup for this team doing a lot of work in the Top Lane and uh now they join the rest
4:57:24
of group Elder in having one win uh obviously they are one-1 so not feeling as good as the rest but 5 to one now for
4:57:32
group Elder after that so pretty heavily stacked in One Direction n Chim doing their best to keep up with the rest of
4:57:38
the teams in their group there we go that's the fire I was like wait a minute is it full no no no
4:57:44
they're updating it and they got the Elder Dragon in this game oh true yeah
4:57:52
they linked up a lot of
4:57:57
celebrations a lot of heartfelt ones you know nothing to prepared or anything like that until
4:58:03
this he was a sand Soldier he's like I'm not a zero I'm just the sand soldier that you know I get it
4:58:11
to you respectable Y and uh oh we go from the
4:58:18
hands just a wave no Blitz crank grab today well he doesn't play it so yeah I
4:58:23
mean unfortunate for the Bros or is it because I feel like we we got we got
4:58:28
entertained the fans got entertained I can't even really you know they were doing their best to entertain
4:58:33
us they definitely entertained us uh Unfortunately they didn't get the win of the day but uh that was a bro series if
4:58:40
ever we've seen one yeah it really was you can see how happy the coaching staff is with kingan as well I think he's a
4:58:46
very easy player of the match to go ahead and vote for 11 out of 11 not even media can stop stop us this
4:58:54
time and I mean on the side of
4:59:00
bro as we have a very interesting sign there as
4:59:06
well flew from Mongolia today yesterday to support an auction so there you go
4:59:13
that's real commitment yeah Y and rewarded with a win um oh I just reminded me earlier we
4:59:19
had the the Gen G fan who was getting married tomorrow we need the Gen G yeah I feel like everyone's being rewarded
4:59:24
today uh the fans who well I me at least the ones we've been showing maybe we're not showing the ones you know the one
4:59:30
who leave immediately after their team loses yeah yeah um they're like all
4:59:35
right I need to we don't follow them with the camera as they go out to the bus the the fan was like yeah I've got
4:59:41
an exam tomorrow how do you feel after bro lost they got an exam tomorrow I need bro to win or I'm going to fail it's like oh yeah well um but it was a
4:59:50
hectic one a lot of back and forth J with some uncharacteristic ji moments
4:59:55
but uh King and I feel like was very consistent in this game not as flashy as I mean I say that when we see that but
5:00:01
generally not as flashy in this game as wasn't the rumble one but just very consistent fish learning a lot about a
5:00:06
as the game went on
5:00:13
final yeah just saying you know take it slow but then also once the arrow hits just go
5:00:18
go hit the turret and the game the defensive off
5:00:24
so into Jack yeah to be fair I mean finding angles
5:00:30
against Ezreal corki Leona how much damage it's hard he's done so much he's
5:00:37
just pumping the numbers do you think we get a out of 11 are we going to have the media upset today we should I mean who
5:00:43
else are you voting for realistically I was I was about to say
5:00:48
Pao I'm like he had a good series I don't know like actually not not sarc that sounded toxic for a second no no no
5:00:55
um yeah I don't know I I guess nobody else lens for playing support elit look you got to think like sometimes no yeah
5:01:02
I mean it's a Nob brain cuz you also he did big number big damage that that that's the easy one to vote for but he's
5:01:08
also the correct one to vote for he's the double wammy you know it's hard to miss on this one it is hard to miss and
5:01:14
he didn't really miss uh with his equalizers with his barrels with the with the Vibes in general I think with
5:01:20
the decision to stay bot and take the turret and not TP to the rift Herald fight you remember that give over the
5:01:26
Feats of Strength he's like I don't care I'm scaling yeah he doesn't care about the feet H did TP top to try and end
5:01:32
with no wave though that was very funny he did do that yeah he always feeling himself he's like I can I could solo
5:01:38
this turret without any no I can't realized no that was a great series uh
5:01:43
we had a lot of fun I hope you guys did as well but we have the interview ready to go let's hand it over to Dear for the
5:01:51
translation thank you very much for the P interview translation
5:01:56
joined by kingan on the side of red for took downon congratulations how do you
5:02:04
feel you know after the last I felt like we were causing so much
5:02:10
nuisance toou but with today's Victory I think we
5:02:16
were able to come back and overcome those
5:02:23
feelings you got such a high damage from play in game one and game plank after
5:02:30
that as well so how are you able to up this output I think our actually really paid
5:02:39
off I think theft Rumble and G also does in a draft
5:02:50
against a lot of the immobile Champions that we had on the enemy team actually worked out really
5:02:56
well and I actually did consider picking other Champions but for game Clank I
5:03:05
think for game two I felt like it was a really good pick just B on what everything play out
5:03:15
the so much cin by you both games one and two so I think it's fair to say that
5:03:22
you got unanimous player of the match votes what do you
5:03:28
think I guess I feel like did deserve unanimous votes so
5:03:36
we'll find out during the the break
5:03:42
G at least support from leh made appearance and after that game leh said
5:03:47
at least tastes terrible so perhaps he was more disappointed than expected what did you think you know during the game I
5:03:53
thought he was really good so when I heard uh yeah it terrible I was like oh
5:03:58
I don't think it was that bad but to be honest Le besides from
5:04:04
Elise he does take a lot of these weird champ I think L is really it counts as
5:04:12
one of his normal picks honestly so do you like these kind of um
5:04:18
strange I think the biggest thing is that it's really fun to watch and also play from his
5:04:27
perspective and having the champion that only you have data
5:04:32
for it's also something that really plays out well
5:04:41
and you said that you joined notion because of J and leens in an interview so now that you got to play Team what do
5:04:48
you have to say great as expected and as for
5:04:56
you in team fights he always tries to come up with contributions to how how to
5:05:02
maximum Max Dam outut so I think also
5:05:08
does a lot of positive things during as well so I think it's been a lot better
5:05:16
than what I had
5:05:22
expected Victory you secured gr ERS Victory and the current score is 5-1
5:05:29
what do you think you know now I'm just thinking that it's really going to be hard for
5:05:36
them to come back so I think we can honestly start playing easy it'll be
5:05:41
good and anything you'd like to say to group Elder teams for the weekend
5:05:49
matches now I want us to go ahead and keep on winning group out fighting and that's
5:05:56
the end of the interview with kingan and back to the space thank
5:06:02
you thank you very much dear as Nong shim red Force take down okay man Brion
5:06:08
2 to zero and as was stated in the interview it is a dominant dominant
5:06:13
start here for group Elder welcome back to space for the final time Deon alongside wolf and W did and yet again
5:06:22
another messy fight but more importantly uh a huge huge performance here from
5:06:27
kingan yeah definitely uh kingan made the difference between those two teams uh for me uh it was kind of dizzy and
5:06:35
messy games definitely uh didn't really kind of enjoy it enough uh to watch the
5:06:41
game but I think I'm I'm just being honest you know I'm I'm I'm toxic Korean
5:06:46
so uh yeah it was it was definitely like if you look at the score line you're like wow two- Z dominant win for Noam it
5:06:52
might be what you initially think but it was actually much more back and forth much messier than that scoreline would
5:06:58
actually tell you yeah uh definitely what did you make of this performance by King so I mean he was the main carry
5:07:05
obviously popped off on Rumble and was a big reason why they won game one and I feel like in both games kind of hard
5:07:11
carried his team Kicking and Screaming across the Finish Line especially in that second game where Fisher was having
5:07:17
some weird old SE was missing every arrow and King is like I guess I could do everything by myself I will actually
5:07:22
do it I mean that goes same for me as well like everyone has made some silly mistakes but I think kingan is the only
5:07:29
one that who didn't make the uh any crazy mistakes and that's the huge difference between those two teams and I
5:07:36
think kingan was the definitely a king today yeah definitely played great uh
5:07:41
and didn't see too many mistakes you know what else we haven't seen a lot of I guess we have a couple more quotes here first uh king of damage Ox oxes is
5:07:49
straightforward straight to the point that's why his name only has three letters there straight to the point with
5:07:55
a top laner like this I would play supportive all right this meme is this meme is getting dragged across the
5:08:00
Finish Line too I suppose I like that one all right
5:08:06
nice okay he he really did though I mean Cloud I think is putting it very
5:08:12
politely Prince yeah he's making a hot Friday night for
5:08:17
everybody plus when you get to play this match they're done for the rest of the week they get to go ahead and relax for
5:08:23
a bit especially with the lead that they have so like I was saying earlier not a lot of mistakes from kingan you know El
5:08:29
we haven't seen Aon ruinous Aon zero so far in week one teams just don't fight
5:08:36
enough to ever see it so we've just been been seeing the voracious kind yeah it's
5:08:41
sub 14 minutes where that gets decided so me and you Deon we were hoping that maybe we'd have some craziness but it's
5:08:47
the lck after all I guess I guess we're a little off on this one I think we're pretty doomed yeah uh not so great
5:08:53
here's the draft here from game number two what stuck out at you for this one with did I mean for me uh nowadays it's
5:08:59
really simple to think about the draft you just need a a better setup better setup and better supports as I mentioned
5:09:05
you need the front Lane and you need the uh some kind of front line but I feel like again Brion side is a little bit
5:09:12
hard to set up what you want to do in the team fight and when you think about the vision setup you really need to play
5:09:19
on your pressure really well but I think they didn't pull it off no but in our first replay they weren't really
5:09:25
fighting around any Vision points that uh were too scary was just in the mid line I mean this is the point you know
5:09:30
you have the maai you maai coming in from the side and Ash just hitting the front line looks way easier but I think
5:09:37
at this point they had the point uh Brion they could actually win the fight but they were missing out some skills
5:09:44
here yeah unfortunately a lot misses and it's it's super textbook what Nim tried to do they're like okay you're trying to
5:09:50
push our turret it's going low we have the maai set up to try to chase you down and catch you a little bit of an awkward
5:09:55
start to the fight but bro just it felt like every time they they got one step forward they took two steps back in this
5:10:01
game and this is one of those examples of the fights where couldn't actually clean things up there take the turret like they planned yeah they were
5:10:07
consistently within about a 000 and 2,000 gold until 24 minutes and pushed it all the way to an elder dragon fight
5:10:15
which you see here at 31 and it it was it started okay but it ended up being a
5:10:20
little crazy at the end I mean it's again uh I think nowadays people are
5:10:26
more thinking about stacking up the CC you know I think back in the day if you need engage tool you just pick one
5:10:32
Champion that you can engage but nowadays a lot of teams are picking many many cc's many many engage tools so you
5:10:38
can make game easier you know the cool thing about this for at this stage of the late game we talked about how their
5:10:43
scaling is so incredibly strong in this game but they really have three carry threats so even though GI gets taken out
5:10:49
here early you have that massive damage coming through from kingan on the flank his barrage was massive and then watch
5:10:54
how much fer could do here just on the edge has a fantastic ult here as well to deny Morgan's engage he had a few whiffs
5:11:00
he had a few messy ones but this one was actually well predicted the timing of which Morgan was going to go in um if
5:11:05
Morgan Waits there it would have looked a little bit silly but he actually predicted it incredibly well and does so much damage to help clean up there's
5:11:11
just too many carry threats you mentioned the CC they put everything on the ash but there were two other carry threats that they couldn't deal with
5:11:17
yeah they snowballed really well they already had the ocean Drake Soul as well and they didn't look for The Elder at
5:11:22
the end kingan tpd into the enemy base and uh thinking about the rotation as well everything looked really perfect
5:11:28
for them yeah great job by the squad of nim to bounce back after the loss earlier in the week to uh get themselves
5:11:36
on the scoreboard as we take a look at Z scoreboard five 5 to one remember the winning
5:11:41
group the top three from the winning group go straight to playoffs the bottom two are the higher seed and play in so
5:11:48
being on The Winning Side is helpful and if you're one of those top teams your lower teams getting those wins in your
5:11:54
group helps so so much it's also really rough for bro because the bottom team doesn't get a chance in the losing group
5:11:59
and they are currently at the bottom of the standings after the 0-2 loss so feels doubly bad for them in this
5:12:04
situation yeah and speaking of uh the Bros here their next game are against
5:12:09
those top teams on the other side of the bracket in KT D+ and gen G it's uh you
5:12:17
know never say never until you know until it's over but uh it's never BR
5:12:23
over until you're not breathing oh you're breathing yeah that's right we're still breathing you know who's breathing the DN freaks they are the only team
5:12:30
with the victory on the side of group Baron they take on D plus Kia and then T1 make their return up against DRX
5:12:38
looking for a win here what are you excited about from that series with did uh for me uh my predictions are doomed
5:12:43
for now so I don't want to think about it that much but anyways I feel like both sides are pretty much doable I I
5:12:51
think both sides can have the chance to win uh against each others so I think it's going to be really interesting
5:12:56
match all right well we'll see how it all shakes up tomorrow on behalf of everyone here on the lck thank you so so
5:13:02
