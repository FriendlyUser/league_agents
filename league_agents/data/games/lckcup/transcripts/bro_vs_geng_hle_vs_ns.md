Whitey welcome ladies and gentlemen to the lck
22:04
cup here for 2025 I'm Atlas I'm joined by Orcs for the very first time this year very excited to be here alongside
22:11
you for what could be some pretty quick games to be perfectly honest with the orx uh do you see some hope for the Bros
22:17
any bro levers in the chat because if you are there we're going to need you to be as loud as is humanly possible in a
22:24
no sound based Communication System I mean we have seen bro upset geni against
22:30
insurmountable odds before um in 2023 summer but that was a long time ago and I feel like we always bring that up will
22:36
it happen again will lightning strike twice that's kind of the question we're going with at the moment do we call it lightning striking twice when it's like
22:42
separated by 2 years and a lot of other games I don't know does anyone like like lightning happen more than once is that
22:48
what you mean like because yes lightning does in fact happen more than once yeah I guess the saying needs a little bit of
22:55
tweaking little bit TW perhaps let's have a look at the standings which have of course been tweaked a little bit uh
23:01
moving into today's matches geni still 2 and Zer as we can see 0 and two for bro
23:06
currently sitting in fourth place but likely to move to fifth with a loss here you can see bfx or bnk are the team that
23:14
are in last place but that's only because they've played an extra game and they have stolen games off teams so far
23:19
so it is likely that bro are going to be the one sitting in last unless they can win here yeah I think honestly winning
23:25
would be fantastic for bro but even taking a game would put them tied with bfx uh for those who don't know uh the
23:32
team who are last place in the losing group don't get a chance to play further you know they are out completely off the
23:38
cup the other four teams still get an opportunity to go further so if we look at the the score between the groups
23:44
little bit one-sided towards ELD if I'm on group Baron it's no longer about hey can our group win it's um can I avoid
23:50
that bottom spot is is the main focus I feel right now yep don't be last place that is the plan so a zero loss streak
23:57
for bro a little bit unfortunate there and ji are looking absolutely Unstoppable I think a lot of people had
24:04
their eyes on Duro maybe as far as like what could be a point of possible
24:10
hiccups uh for this geni roster Duro has been fantastic uh him and rer have
24:15
played really really well this team looks like some domestic geni that we've been used to seeing and it's terrifying
24:22
and uh hype is really good guys but don't judge him based on this particular match up it's going to be rough fun you
24:27
know obviously they rot between the ad cares trying to see what works um hype him back in I think you know he played
24:32
pretty fine in that in that first match but uh rer was a tough opponent and rer I feel like you know he's really fit in
24:38
with this geni lineup it feels like you know it's like he's been there before it's like he's been I it's crazy way of
24:45
describing it I was searching for the words and you just hit on the head yeah I I do that I I hit things on the head
24:51
um Cori on a 010 winless State yeah he's not doing so hard uh and as far as like other Champions that haven't won yet I
24:58
it's like zero and two and things like this like it's really not anything like what cor has been able to put up as far
25:05
as disappointing numbers yeah and I think as well it is such a high priority pick you know sometimes you see lower
25:10
priority picks that come down especially later in fearless or like the picked in not an ideal situation Cori's been
25:16
prioritized early and just consistently lost and it's not just bad teams picking it there's been a range of teams picking
25:22
it and they've just been struggling yeah I think nocturn and Nico are examples of 02 Champions but I I don't even
25:30
necessarily think that those losses were their fault neither are the Corky games necessarily but uh look you never really
25:37
know we're getting very close though ladies and gentlemen I'm going to need bro Leaf in the chat as much as possible
25:44
this is David versus Goliath the phrase that we've never used before a reference
25:49
we've never made before here in the lck but yeah this is going to be a doozy it's going to be a potential rough run
25:55
rough one for the Bros unless their lord and savior on that top side
26:01
of the map can carry them through can bring these spirits up to where they
26:06
need to be and they just need that Cas up energy you know I feel like it's been a disappointing start and it's difficult
26:13
to say that they're going to be able to bounce back against geni in particular but you know the form we saw for them in the Casper cup gave so much hope and it
26:20
kind of has been dashed a little bit I want to give a shout out though to closer I think typically when you play against gen one of the main points of
26:26
issue is that you're playing against ch so your mid laner can really struggle but the last series bro had K was popping off so if there's anyone who can
26:33
actually from these lower ranked teams maybe just hold his own against chovi I'm hoping that kosa can do that cuz you
26:40
know if you if you crumble against chovi the game just do there's no no real coming back from that Broan from New
26:45
York that's dope you know who else is from New York Brendan Brendon Valdez so
26:51
thankfully we still have some of that New Yorker energy in LOL Park even though he is taking a day off y y
26:58
brilliant absolutely golden maybe this is maybe signs are pointing towards the
27:04
Bro upset maybe maybe we should commentate this game completely
27:09
differently ORS I've got a proposal to make I think we all a bit biased towards gen right now well that's what I'm saying so perhaps what we should do is
27:17
instead and without providing context Midway through commentate this entire
27:22
series based on bro being the clear favorites moving into this game well if you think about who's recently won a
27:30
tournament it's bro am I right they won the Casper J you didn't win the Casper cup how many games did bro lose at
27:37
Worlds zero wow I know wow you know I'm give me a sec I need to run the I'm I'm
27:43
fact cheing and you're correct how have we missed this I don't know and everyone's just tunneling on the fact
27:50
that they lost their first two games they were calibrating that's what bro does they calibrate they have to make
27:55
sure that they understand like where the bottom is so that they can launch to the sky if you're diving into like a body of
28:04
water you want to hit the bottom so that you can get that big push off we all know get back up they get the spirit
28:09
energy right the fans have to give them the support and you know I don't want to place any individual blame but if you're
28:16
in chat right now and you haven't paid your bro taxes true that is why they haven't had the power so I really hope
28:22
that you're getting in there right now and contributing because if you want bro to win they need the fan support that is
28:28
what this team thrives on and honestly I didn't pay mine so I'm doing it right now I know that it's uh it's a little
28:34
bit illegal to to do it while we're in the middle of the show but it's just what has to happen you got to do it yeah
28:41
so here it is wait I I I just sent some Korean
28:48
characters it's totally fine the Bro tax is paid let's dive into the draft here for game number one the Casper
28:54
Victorious Bros now taking on unfortunately not able to take them down
29:00
at the very last moment J who are going to ban away the SC it does make a lot of sense huk actually picking up uh Bros
29:06
only win with that champion I saw some stats between like LC lck and LPL SC has
29:12
been Le through four times 100% win rate yeah it has died
29:20
once oh my God honestly impressive they managed to take it out that one time but yeah this champ not okay uh similar
29:26
those ad carry bands uh I think especially against ruler the varus ash makes a lot of sense Hy going to be
29:32
banned away so not going to see pick that up which I think you know maybe bro
29:37
fans getting a freebie you love to see that yeah picking up the kante H I think double wammy the only is to pick very
29:43
strong but also denies it from King Sante y uh which you know and you get
29:48
the Lord Sante as well although the Jace does come through um we do have Zyra locked in uh reminder that unending
29:56
despair is still uh banned I'm pretty sure so so not going to be seeing that one not going to be seeing any weird
30:02
interactions with Jace and R we've seen Zyra have a pretty low win rate in the lck but I think a lot of that was down
30:08
to longrange poke compositions and specifically like nidle cuz nley can keep Pace with Zyra but you have the
30:13
long range Spears you don't actually have to go into uh the Zyra and also people would often pick Leona into it
30:20
yeah throw out the solar FL from the distance follow up with like the the nly spear nley Bann by bro and Leona is now
30:26
picked by gen so less of that long range non-committal threat onto Zyra and if
30:32
you're playing VI you have to get Mele range if you want to kill a Zyra and that means Zar can press a buttons and his job is done and she gets to press
30:39
them as VI is coming in as well it's pretty telegraphed so we'll have to see how huk is going to play around it V
30:45
definitely one of his comfort picks huk and Lucid in Challenger were somewhat similar in that regard as far as really
30:52
liking to prioritize Violet so she is going to be locked away once again ad carries back on the list here for bro
30:59
they want to make ruler's life as hard as possible um we have seen rer play a few other Champions that are not the
31:05
ones that are currently banned so we'll have to see how uh he's going to adapt to this Ezreal still up and available
31:11
for example uh Des ukis things like that still interesting to see the raan ban
31:16
cuz you know Leon's pretty fine match up but also like playing raan into Zyra is very uncomfortable um but not want to
31:22
deal with that EXT Mobility obviously a pick that PO has lent on a decent amount y I do think the MF makes a decent
31:27
amount of sense especially cuz we often see like the Leona work well into the MF cuz you can Al it from a distance but it also pairs well with the MF so really
31:35
thinning away those tools for the uh Edie car's one last ban here which Ed it
31:41
will be the E does make a fair bit of sense if you're going to go this far in don't give roller one of his best Champs at the end so I mean we haven't seen mid
31:49
lane yet um looks like they're just leaning towards the Jin I do feel like if you went AP if you went someone like
31:55
zigs you would be very AP heavy especially if it does end up being the tank Jace you know Zyra is also really good as solo AP just because she does so
32:02
much AOE damage yeah I think definitely making the M armor a lot more preferable
32:07
and uh yeah a lot of long range setup as well between like the Jin and the Jace
32:12
obviously if it is that tank Chase then your Pok not going to be as severe but uh definitely the the plants a really good uh way to proc the route for Jin
32:20
now it's up to Bon to pick that bot Lane they know what they are going to face though in that matchup so I have some
32:26
information I think Alistar does make a fair bit of sense sort of the only engaged support left as far as top tier
32:32
is concerned Nautilus hasn't found all that much success so far this season and nless into Zyra and Leon it's a lot of
32:40
telegraphed engage that you're really not psyched about he'll just get mangled I mean I don't think alist has a great time into uh Zyra but at least you don't
32:47
get one shot uh and good into the they are going to pick up the Kaiser as well so fully committed now bro to this dive
32:54
heavy composition and there's a lot of anti-dive tools from from the side of uh jeni I imagine it's going to be tank or
33:01
Bruiser Jace so not going to be the easiest Target Jin and Zyra uh well zyen
33:06
particularly can unload a combo from a distance but Jin obviously can just fire away now question is what trov is going
33:12
to play he can play whatever he likes I think he really wants to play uh Aurelia
33:18
he's been hovering it quite a few times um I remember there was a time where he was like practicing it so so much of
33:24
course it was metaph for a little bit um but he does like to go back to the champion very similar to closer who uh
33:29
was the aelia one trick when he joined the lck both of them enthusiastic but not able to actually play that champ
33:35
just going to be the o yeah does have that ad as well so it is solo AP Zyra makes it awkward to itemize against and
33:42
even like M Treads like you won't make thre against Leona uh and you know decent against on Jin and against Zyra
33:48
but a lot of AD threats to kind of make that pitch uncomfortable ultimately Bros comp feels very dive focused very go in
33:56
uh I think geni has a bit more diversity what the composition can do but a lot of Peel tools so you know bro need to be
34:02
really CR with the engages if they're going to come out ahead in this one by the way I really like uh twitch chat at
34:08
the moment U making sure that they get that copy Pastor in um with their brox
34:13
included it's cuz if you are a bro fan you do generally have a lot of Channel points because you've all end on bro
34:20
every single time and they just win all the time yep so you'll just have heaps so keep them highlighted keep them
34:26
coming in and and let's see whether broken perform the way we expect moving
34:31
into this match Kasper Cup champions here just to win they've got the Aurora in the mid lane um not necessarily
34:38
feeling totally closer vibed but I think he should still be able to navigate it a lot of power there VI very strong at the
34:44
moment Cante pretty powerful bottom Lane I'm a little bit worried about in the early stages we'll see how it does go as
34:51
ji looks to try and take down the titans of bro [Music]
35:01
[Music] how many witch Champions do we have in the game so
35:07
far um does I include skins cuz like Jan's got a skin yeah we got moana's got a I can think of seven off the top of my
35:14
head okay rattle them off now so there's like there's n bitching NY skin right y
35:20
you've got that Aurora that we just saw Duro is going to go in so I'm going to have to hold the thought is unfortunately flashing into the stun as
35:28
hok is still just able to walk away he fine it's calculated he knew it didn't have to flash on an angle but that is
35:34
still Jungle of flash now down here at 1 minute into the game suboptimal but
35:39
probably not something that bro are going to really be too upset about we can now get a lot of vision else it unlocks juro's hex flash which is a big
35:46
thing it's interesting because typically we see teams invade against Zyra like one of the objectives is if you clear
35:52
out her plants her Clay is going to be slower so geni taking the initiative to heavily invade themselves does mean that
35:59
Canyon won't have as many plans stacked up but you know you put some pressure onto hamach and force him out of his
36:04
topside jungle yeah this is uh not the not the most optimal start you could say they do
36:10
also get all of that deep Vision like we're seeing it's just going to be standard Lanes as closer playing pretty
36:16
aggressively up against Troy here who is going to have a little bit more of a rough time in the laning
36:22
phase shouldn't bother him too much though as hug is going to make his way over this is bit sneak is not on Vision
36:28
we do have another engage but that pulverized onto ruler a lot of work now being done not able to land the W either
36:36
so ruler is going to uh just be there at 50% Health looks like we're going even more aggressive as level two on the
36:42
cards here for bro as you can see there yeah unending despair is Ban two combat
36:48
Summoners from the side of gen for one from Bros actually getting a good amount of pressure here now hanack invading
36:53
here I think is kind of on the back of um not being sure about what happened in his blue side jungle for all he knows
37:00
Canyon could have you know taken taken the camps there so he makes a bit of an aggressive move to try and uh take this
37:06
out but with the ward information he's been given heage exactly so able to move back that
37:13
Ward actually giving them a lot of value you don't see that one as as many times as the others like normally it's the
37:19
layer of top side wards that we see blue side are making just to scout for the lane swaps things like this and this is
37:25
good play from Bros bot Lane and you're not going to find the grasping roots does get a slow on too
37:31
here who's not too worried but yeah hype is just going to oh man almost Pro it
37:36
and bro as expected just uh just having the answers here yeah I mean doing a fantastic job and in that situation
37:42
Canyon's like right well I've kind of been routed in the jungle there's not much I can do other than go for a gank
37:48
bro despite the fact that hyper poloo had an advantage in the 2v2 they back off completely there is a concern here
37:54
though for closer he's very pushed up but chov is low so a minut it an auror should be able to get out be able to
38:01
does get caught there as you can see down to 50% now as Canyon going to try and get out oh my God he's almost going
38:08
to kill both of them which is kind of ridiculous lands the que there as closer just needs one more Auto that's going to
38:13
be it first Blood goes over one V2 for closer in the mid lane looks like he doesn't want to go out he wants to go in
38:20
and he gets a kill on the canyon he's had a disastrous early game so far the handback does get the Scuttle yeah I
38:26
don't know who's going to win this one but with Troy turning up looking pretty favored towards Kean finds the shock
38:32
blast as Morgan he's going to have to come in and's saves his teammate oh bro
38:38
with all the answers man everything going right for them I mean clearly the Bro tax has been paid and it is paying
38:46
off hey keep that coming in guys if the energy runs out the ji may still win but
38:52
the teamwork has just been so good you know from everything from the brot lane backing off to you know close a playing
38:58
this so beautifully individually and like because he did so much work early chovy was already so low very tentative
39:04
about going in he flashes the knockup and then gets them both with the combo chy you know finishes has to go back
39:11
with his soul and cany just has nothing left to try and finish him off even ends up flashing and giving over the red buff
39:16
to closer uh then obviously we saw Morgan coming with a shield everything going
39:21
right for them and considering that when you're playing the Zyra into V match up
39:26
you expect to have a farm lead you're expecting to be ahead you're expecting to have extra time Canyon being behind
39:32
in this matchup is kind of unprecedented yeah it's uh it's a little bit ridiculous and of course he is going to
39:37
be able to probably catch up pretty comfortably um just because as you get into the Rhythm as you get more items
39:42
and you just Farm a little bit faster as closer is still playing hyper aggressive against Troy understandably so went back
39:49
got his boots of Lucidity and is very very happy with how this one's going Morgan is obviously just not having a
39:56
great time um uh because he's Cante Jace in the early levels but he just needs to
40:01
exist yep whether the storm you know eventually gets some armor and the lane becomes a lot more chill but the fact
40:09
that it's this Aurora that is accelerated has hit level six and is going to immediately press the buttons I
40:16
don't know whether he necessarily needed to but the message has been received some supportal combat here towards the bottom side of mid lane and Morgan is
40:23
teleporting back down to bot's side looks like it is grubs on the mind of everyone we got a reset coming in for
40:29
closa he's going to come back and we'll see who's going to be able to lock this one down is it going to be another feed of strength or at least a third of one
40:37
as bro looking to put on another sandal and it's going to move on over and I think they're just going to try
40:42
and make sure that they don't lose out on the feet of strength I think bro should be cautious about this they already got one so it's fine to leave
40:49
now if they need oh with clo are turning up though it is looking a little bit dangerous deadly flourish goes wide as
40:57
the might comes down that is one a piece on these grubs the last one is going to be given over to bro by the looks of
41:02
things ji not wanting to poke the bear too much will be able to take that one down as Clos it makes his way back to
41:07
Mid kee's the one that's actually positioned there which is quite interesting chovy going for the side laning does make a bit of sense I guess
41:13
just because Y is so powerful in those Sidelines I think it makes sense from the perspective of choby wasn't level six yet was also you know a little bit
41:20
behind and was resetting a bit late so by putting him towards the bot Lane they have the power from Keen there
41:26
immediately in the mid lane and I think it gave geni just more odds for contesting they only got the one grub
41:31
but you deny that uh contribution towards the feat of strength so that that's all you need so I think it's a a smart assignment from jengi uh and bro
41:39
don't get the full reward for those grubs where were you when bro had a gold lead at 7 minutes right here in the SE
41:47
all right sorry yeah I knew that uh I needed to stop looking at the screen need to confirm uh I was there too um
41:54
same place uh L Park let me know where you guys were because this is actually
41:59
happening this is real life it's 7 and a half minutes and it's still a slight bro
42:05
Advantage a bro Vantage it was it's a it's a bro Vantage and honestly like
42:11
they couldn't have asked for a better way to start this game so we'll just have to see whether they can continue that moving
42:17
forward as of course if you were to like if I was to be honest about the kesu situation um they were missing some
42:23
players uh you could say um when they were playing in that
42:28
one so if bro are able to actually win here as well then I don't even know yeah
42:35
I feel like bro's schedule in the LC cup they ended up facing a lot of the a lot of their tougher opponents early wait a
42:42
second perhaps not um a lot of the expected easier opponents early which has made the like following end of the
42:49
the lck cup really difficult um but if they can start to kind of bring it together and find some upsets know they
42:56
can keep that hopes alive and as as you're not in that last spot as long as you're not that last spot you know
43:02
there's infinite possibilities when you get to the latest stage of the tournament you can still fight your way through yeah and just a remind it
43:08
everyone they just need to win one game to at least equalize with bnk yeah so if
43:14
they win this one here even if they go ahead to like just lose back toback games after this would be absolutely
43:20
amazing for the Bros try still struggling here into cler who's able to avoid quite a lot of these buttons hok
43:26
moving over over wants to try and deny but not going to look for too much more
43:32
not baited by the Unbound Soul or anything like that yeah when you see top and jungle a
43:37
little bit ahead kind of expected have pressure oh another Alti does come down here from closer hits a whole bunch of
43:43
buttons and try has to flash does miss the cannon though Sly for closer but uh I think he's okay with that oh W he's
43:48
flashing in can he get the pull back it's not going to happen so doesn't quite have the damage there he's investing a lot does get chy flash from
43:55
earlier but wants to throw is out as well and he will do that so close the electri proc comes in just just not
44:02
quite enough damage to take out try but I love this energy from closer he's really pushing toi and pressuring him in
44:09
the lane and this is exactly what you were talking about before like we were talking about the closer energy which is it doesn't matter what the name plate
44:15
opposing him is he is going to be closer y 100% And I I feel like even in Bros
44:22
losses Clos has had some really good performances uh and has been a great addition to this lineup this mid jungle I think was what everyone was looking at
44:29
after the Kasper cup so you know especially I feel like when you're going up against gen's mid jungle that's the
44:35
big test it really is and so far they're passing and uh you know that Morgan's going to be fine you know I know Keane's
44:41
a really really good player but Morgan is the Lord so he is going to be okay hype coming in as well and has been
44:48
farming exceptionally well actually playing out the early stage quite nicely in this game and aiser if you can get
44:53
going especially because this is going to be the more AP variant I'm pretty sure does make us feel a little bit better
44:59
about how this game is uh going to go on CU we have seen a bit of the physical
45:04
Kaiser and it just feels like a false flat on its face yeah definitely get has a lot of
45:10
value Al that comp is quite AP heavy if it is more AP Kaiser so some Vision coming in here as po does
45:17
take a bit of damage from Kane going to be one of those grubs locked down it looks like it is going to be a f of
45:22
strength though going over to gen and a grub Advantage as huk has given up on going for that one they did grab the
45:28
cloud Drake first one that spawned next one's going to be up in 2 and 1 half minutes yeah I think perhaps close's old
45:34
Z just coming up now not being available um weighing in bro's decision not to
45:39
contest this think look we can get some plates in the bot side it's only one uh sort of piece of the fatza strength and
45:47
you know four grubs is definitely nice don't get me wrong but uh it's not like they given over six or anything yep and
45:53
uh a few plates going over to Morgan as well in the meantime who does man to push that bottom Lane pretty far out
45:59
remember with first blood they only need to get first turret and they are done as far as those feets are concerned they
46:04
need to worry themselves with uh as much of these objectives that they would otherwise need
46:12
to see what they can actually do here Keen of course is going to be pushing incredibly quickly uh because he's
46:19
jat just to see how it goes as Canyon's moving on in perfect timing here as Morgan decides to go slightly aggressive
46:25
but he's cassant so he's not dying doesn't quite catch I mean it wouldn't have killed him but uh definitely could have got a good amount of damage down
46:32
maybe led to some pressure on that Tower it does feel like grasping Roots goes that little bit too slow I don't know
46:38
whether it goes that much slower than other skill shots but it just feels like it's a bit too slow it definitely does
46:44
and it's also the fact that like you have the little lock out when you cast it they just so slugish just missed
46:50
another cat you know closa has been fantastic game that's the second Cannon I've seen him Miss hey he's missed like every Cannon still 525 gold ah head gig
46:58
pretty good he's just being very generous you know he doesn't want he doesn't want to make chovy feel too bad about it chov is the farming guy you
47:04
know he needs to let him catch up a little bit Po's coming up here looking to try and cause a rockus might be that
47:10
they can get some decent damage onto this turret though as we can see Duro is over here and Canyon's in the vicinity
47:16
but that is a lot of damage as the Zenith blade doesn't quite work out here for Duro the ulti comes through once again as chovi is likely to die because
47:24
huk is there waiting for him back at his soul and now Duro he's just by himself
47:29
ruler is going to move up deadly flourish gave away his position and they are just going to exit two kills now for bro pretty clean some great Target
47:37
selection there you know turning onto chovi and able to punish him uh in that situation also closer super it looked
47:44
like juru was going to find an angle onto him but it was just super slick the way he kind of read him uh like a book and was able to disengage without
47:51
getting CAU out so geni definitely looks for a play there on the counter TI just doesn't come through yeah I kind of really wanted um hyp to just go in you
47:59
know he was just on with the Vibes yeah this e Flash from it's so hard to kind of read that in advance Theo was sorry
48:06
close was really fast with it and able to avoid it does get locked up on the tower a little bit and hand back flashes
48:11
away right decision you know as much as he's high HP if you eat that you know Zyra Al jinel potentially going to come
48:17
out afterwards so bro get what they want and disengage don't stay for more they are not greedy Giga chards oh no
48:23
definitely not measured Giga chards that's the it's the only way you can really describe it as closing out moving
48:29
on over be a to get a bit of damage onto this turret as Keane is going to be here and the wave is kind of running out so
48:35
never mind plates are going to fall off they did manage to get a fair few of
48:41
them yeah a lot of low Towers I mean well bot Tower is the lowest one but you know there's a decent amount of damage
48:47
done this top Tower as well so bro if they can secure these towers will get those creat of strength something they
48:53
can look towards but right now Dragon up and on the table Canyon starting off yeah for away a little bit Morgan just
49:00
does not care about what is doing whatsoever and he's just going to be able to walk away arakan is going to be
49:06
coming up on that top side of the map as it looks like ji going to be able
49:11
to even out the dragons that is going to get them another uh third of a feet of strength towards the two sandals that
49:18
they'll be able to put on their feet and that's going to be an infernal Soul this game oh man this is fiery yeah uh
49:25
definitely a lot of beers to as well across the board so a lot of value in that one um now we have Herold in a
49:32
minute and on top of that I I think for Gen the game plan generally is secure
49:37
heral get a tower and just deny the down oh oh Roa I think just got an item he
49:44
did um and so says welcome to luden he might even be able to get the cannon with this extra AP that he has there it
49:49
is he love to see it that's gross that's what we like to see H if King gets his Tower though it's taking a lot of damage
49:56
you could find a way into those pizza strengths the deficit they've had Morgan I don't think is going to be able to stop this one from going down so that is
50:03
just pizza strength or at least one full one and now the objectives become all
50:09
that more important 4 minutes until the dragon but we do have Herald coming up in 17 seconds time so bro really going
50:16
to have to put some priority on that one if they do want to confirm some cool new shoes yeah resets coming in pretty late
50:23
for this Herald you know you've just seen hand back reset you've seen uh both Canyon and duro go back Duro just
50:28
picking up a locket which is pretty big spike honestly the amount of damage that can block especially this early in the
50:34
game uh so we'll see both teams put pressure towards there I mean ideally
50:39
for bro they get this Herald relatively quickly and then they have plenty of time to set up for the dragon as they
50:44
need backto back objectives to lock in these feature strengths but you know it's not the end of the world that they
50:50
don't get them yeah um we haven't necessarily seen a uh a huge win rate
50:56
for of strength to be honest hasn't been as much as a big objective to watch out
51:01
for as we were thinking perhaps in the beginning of the Season yeah I think it's one of these things where like the
51:07
win rate is is like 66% and a lot of that comes from the fact that you know
51:12
you're the team who've taken towers and objectives yeah you got the money from doing the Feats of Strength things yeah the stats themselves aren't that crazy H
51:20
the T3 boots aren't that gold efficient so you don't really get them till like late in the game ever so it's it's one
51:26
of these things that are nice but yeah bro definitely still in there if they aren't able to get it cuz right now Genji has the lead for those but is the
51:31
rift tole picked up so actually dead even and that next dragon will kind of decide who is able to get the feet yep
51:38
and with the rift Aral they should be able to create some space to get vision control and things like that around said
51:43
dragon is uh the theory that I have in my mind but they are able to take down the top out of turret at the same time
51:48
that's going to uh keep them in the lead by this 1,000 gold that has been there basically at a flatline for the entirety
51:54
of the game I mean it's crazy almost all of that is in the mid lane uh
52:00
yeah between closer and chovy closer pretty strong right now uh not sure if
52:06
you'll be able to get a second item before that dragon fight and the thing is you know I'm look at the top right of the screen we have the dragon time in 2
52:12
minutes and then the adakan in 2 minutes 20 and they are on opposite sides of the map but it's kind of like if you lose
52:17
that dragon fight hard enough yeah you can just give it up you could just end up losing that account as well so uh lot
52:24
will be dependent on that I feel and it's actually going to be more of the damage Chase coming out from Keen I like
52:30
it I actually feel like we are seeing a little bit less of the tank jaase just because un spare is uh is gone yeah we
52:36
have sort of like you know black pav into uh fimble winter a bit it's like a
52:41
mix sort of build or like Z and dar will going like shoin into fimble winter but
52:46
this is more so like no I want I want to do damage I want to hit things with my shock blasts find it interesting that
52:51
it's black F into it as well often with uh the M Mana you see a lot of ality
52:57
style builds few different items but it's kind of cool seen a lot of different Chase builds it's just been a
53:03
lot of different ones yeah you can kind of just build build items and it'll be fine still takes grasp it's fine just
53:10
build health and things it be it'll be great Clos coming on over doesn't quite find the
53:16
damage ji moving themselves towards this bottom side slowly but surely because
53:22
that dragon is on their minds 50 seconds for that one grasping Roots almost walked into there by
53:27
they do utilize the rift to try and get a charge here onto this outer turret taking a fair bit of damage the rest of
53:33
bro are moving in Morgan on a flank angle this charge really taken a while
53:38
as trovy also taking a fair bit of damage that is the charge successfully landed there by shell before she does fall down solar flare hitting The Sweet
53:45
Spot is now po trying to turn it around Duro taking a lot as the UL is invested by closer but is it a little bit too
53:51
early to pull the trigger that's the question I think it's a bit early and it didn't get that much value and now two
53:57
big alss down from bro you know po won't be nearly as tanky without his ultimate closer considering he's the most fed
54:03
member on the side of bro lacking that big team fight ultimate yeah this could
54:09
be an indicate they might they might just give it up they might just give up the dragon you can see based on how close is moving they've gone right we we
54:14
didn't find the angle let's be generous gachard this time indeed that's what they're going to do and so that is going
54:20
to be the dragon secured here by gen they get themselves the feat as well really felt like that moment was like
54:26
the classic Paul Walker presses his NOS button and then Vin Diesel's like haha kid and then uh presses his at the very
54:33
end presses his harder yeah and it just uh just works a whole lot better yeah wi
54:38
that quarter mile as try trying to be a little bit aggressive takes turret shot but isn't going to be too worried about it yeah I think it's going to be big
54:44
they already they obviously got the herald hit onto the tower that mid Tower is really low but you kind of saw like the setup we had around mid like closer
54:51
he altered them but it was so easy for them just to retreat to the tower I think bro getting that tier one made would make a big difference uh kind of a
55:00
lot more opportunity to play the flanks when that's down a lot more angles and a lot more uncomfortable positions you can
55:06
put geni in so I think bro Focus really should be on trying to secure that if they can it's already pretty low so
55:12
won't take much to finish it off yep we'll have to keep checking in on what's going on there as this Ward is surviving
55:19
but uh probably not too much longer as it did just get scry as bloomed 4 minutes until the baron does come up
55:26
probably not going to see too much action around there is now rer fighting against hype here but hype not really
55:32
winning even though he sort of opted in yeah was hoping to get passive FR at the end but Canyon shows up and hype decides
55:37
against it uh ruler going for a bit of the mosquito gin build yep I've seen
55:43
time and time before does like when you hit the infinity edge though it feels real nice
55:49
yeah but right now it feels real kind of like you do not a whole lot of anything at all yeah no you still have your route
55:57
and your ult oh coming in and you convert attack speed to damage uh all right we got a Teleport coming in from
56:03
Morgan po already taking a lot of damage as that deadly flourish pretty dangerous onto hyp but he's able to move himself out of the way without having to invest
56:09
the cleanse trovy and Morgan with the same idea as Morgan going to mitigate some of the CC but the solar flare still
56:15
going to connect B breaker comes through they look for Troy on the back hand he tries to ult his way out but Morgan says
56:20
no D is likely to fall as well but Canyon's already taken down po but he
56:25
falls for it and closer is also there flashes over the wall to pick up another and just slips between the veils can he
56:32
keep himself safe that's the question is hype not going to be taken down but it's great aim from ruler and he secures two
56:39
off the back end of the fight to win it for jeni one of the things with playing against Jin if you can't exit the fight
56:45
cleanly you will pay for it hyp sacrifices his jungler with that flash at the end we see a replay of the fight
56:52
kind of on two fronts and Morgan they see him overextended think they maybe have a window to punish but managed to
56:57
avoid the center for solar flare and Canyon focuses first onto H does manage
57:03
to take him out but then it's just cleaned up by hype and closer and it's a it's a fight on two fronts you know
57:08
closer and hype doing a lot to clean this up but the problem is if you don't kill the Gin you have low health bars uh
57:14
this is kind of the result of it oh no just sacrific his hand back you know it
57:21
was a little bit of a a sad flash situation but one of them was going to die so uh it was a your poison scenario
57:27
and hug is the one that is unfortunately delivered said poison oh they guy go for the solo FL on a hype he just cleansed
57:34
the slow didn't get hit by the stun uh was concerned about the followup there now both mid Towers pretty low in a
57:41
similar sort of health and you can kind of see from doren's H sorry from Morgan's TP before why that mid tower
57:46
being up is so important cuz if that mid Tower was down completely different environment when he TPS behind them like that
57:52
so I think the team was able to well I think if are able to break down J's tier
57:58
one mid it will make a lot of difference right now though dragon in a minute 30 I think this is one they don't want to
58:04
give up Soul point over especially when it's infernal Soul oh and they're going to lose their out of turret as well bro
58:10
kind of uh falling apart here a little bit we have seen it before yeah we see
58:16
move four members into mid they have uh CH Sil like bro just a bit too focused
58:21
on the jungle Vision kind of let that slip away yeah it's almost like they're doing too much homework work you need to
58:27
start doing some other things as well like moving around trying to position aggressively try and take what they can
58:34
I think a little bit more focus on ruler is going to be helpful but it felt like they were doing the right things in the
58:40
last fight as all the he flash opportunity to come through as the Unbound Soul not going to be enough
58:45
there as the ulti oh they interrupt the blast cone and chovy is delivered on a
58:50
silver platter Duro going in as well does have the eclipse to try and keep himself safe as now Morgan is spotted on that control W huk burning down burning
58:58
down and R is able to take down the cow deadly flourish almost just kills huk on his way out of there that could be an
59:04
ticon angle potentially without trovy it's a little dangerous 25 seconds and he'll be up with teleport available I
59:10
think CL are still having a just makes it too risky to go for it was great play from bro getting chovy down but they end
59:16
up having to sacrifice po to get away so a one for one
59:21
overall okay R starting to do some damage oh man he is getting closer and closer to that Infinity Ed supposed to
59:26
having real items real build yeah I mean this was really nicely played by H back interrupting the blast cone yeah with
59:33
the but it was a good all coming out from Duro the route follows and then it basically is like do you want to lose your jungler or do you want to lose your
59:39
support and the correct decision in any situation is the support uh cuz as much as hand back is low and has to recall
59:45
the fact that you still have your snip uh your Smite on the map uh very important sniped at the end and now yeah
59:52
R has an infinity edge he does have an infinity edge he's now doing damage he can also upgrade his swifties to be
59:58
super duper Mega fast this guy's going to be booking it around the map try
1:00:04
looking to just grab Soul point for free here by himself it's so difficult cuz bro don't want to give up pressure
1:00:09
around not only Baron but atakan as well and then as a result they just end up sacrificing dragon and now gen things
1:00:16
are kind of mounting up they've got a bit of a gold lead but more importantly Three Dragons to one one away from Soul
1:00:23
do you guys remember that time at about and a half minutes when we were talking about bro having a gold lead that was
1:00:28
such a good time was such a good time bring me back yeah that time is is passing and um well it's passed but it's
1:00:36
it seems to be getting worse as well as this control W does spot out gen as bro pulled the trigger see whether it's
1:00:42
actually going to be the right choice though as a Teleport does come in from Morgan right on top of the rest of his teammates making sure that he's going to
1:00:48
be here to assist as Paulo there's the unbreakable will they've already committed to that
1:00:54
button as strangle Thorns come in they do manage to secure this arakan and now Duro is likely just dead Tru is looking
1:01:01
to come in but doesn't quite work out there that sh shock blast a lot of value but no follow up and bro just going to
1:01:07
say all right may as well take the baron as well can be a little bit risky as the health bars Get Low yes it doesn't
1:01:12
matter if they die but if they give up the baron that definitely does oh yeah there's the pulverizes this ulti right
1:01:19
into the backline is gigantic from hok they take down ruler they learned from their previous mistakes and now Morgan
1:01:26
Dives in the baron going to help him out there is Gen G they've just fumbled the ball beautiful play from Roo there
1:01:34
though no intent to finish the baron initially they wanted to fight with the atakan buob this would be so gr if they
1:01:40
lose Baron to a shock Blast from Keane but it's not going to happen huk is going to be able to lock that one down
1:01:47
and that shock blast is somehow going to miss as of course it was blind so he was just trying to find an option they take
1:01:52
mid out of turret as well and we're back to the good time o we're back to it
1:01:57
we're back we're so back right now and it's great moves here from pooll and Morgan making sure Canyon can't get in
1:02:04
the pit as soon as the buff is taken geni want nothing to do with him so they disengage they do sacrifice the support
1:02:10
but then the baron started the risk is even if you die here and The Baron's leashed J could just take it so they
1:02:16
don't let the baron Get Low they immediately look for the fight H back has a beautiful ult as does Morgan the
1:02:22
baron finishes off Canyon and everything just comes together from bro I think a
1:02:27
less confident team when geni tuck that Dragon would have crumbled but brogo look we have to do something we can't
1:02:32
just let the game be lost this what bro didn't do ever last year right they didn't the CER Cup this is the new
1:02:38
energy this is when you make pay your bro tax this is what you get exactly and
1:02:43
uh they're going to get solar FL as well as H going to try and get out of there will successfully do so but uh remember
1:02:49
of course you know it's it's a quick trip home as just gets one shot where'd he go one shot by closer what the the
1:02:56
heck was that damage was absolutely obscene this guy sitting on three items Shadow flame I believe was just
1:03:02
completed and uh yeah gen learned about it inhib turret going to go down inhibitor sh to follow and remember they
1:03:09
still have the voracious buff this is still basically risk-free as they
1:03:14
utilize their Baron to continue pushing oh man that's a 5,000 gold Red
1:03:21
Bull Baron power play and you know what else could we expect from the Cup champions exactly favorites coming into
1:03:28
the series obviously um but just some beautiful play from bro there was that Lull in the mid game a little bit where
1:03:34
they kind of lost lost track of what they were doing but I mean closer has just been Unleashed I feel even the
1:03:41
series in which BR lost he's looked good but he just finds sang Canyon and just
1:03:47
one oh some Aurora things that's uh sort of reminding me of release Aurora which was completely and utterly busted but
1:03:54
that one it's bring us back it's gorgeous a lot of callbacks in in this there certainly are from from now to
1:04:00
earlier in this game and to you know couple of months ago I tell you what
1:04:06
though this Bro Team they're just so fun to watch yeah
1:04:11
because like the closer craziness you know they've added the double Challenger Vibes with huk and hype who are both
1:04:17
legitimately great players but also a little bit unhinged sometimes let's see what they're going to do with it though
1:04:23
because that does also mean that risks can be taken that perhaps shouldn't be as a little knockup does come through
1:04:28
onto po you let's be real every bro fan is a little bit unhinged so unhinged players is just and also every bro fan
1:04:36
expects it as well it's like when you're watching bro you're not watching it for the victory screen at the end you're
1:04:42
watching it for the experience the Jour Journey yes 100% 100% I'm glad we're on
1:04:48
the same page and what a journey is you know you know for a fact that some bro fan has has just dumped like a million
1:04:54
Channel points oh yeah on bro right now and is about to become a channel Point
1:04:59
billionaire off the back of this honestly the the bro predictors are eating so good chy just missed a super
1:05:05
minion there I believe oh my goodness that is very unar Canyon built some very cool shoes um so that's a little bit
1:05:12
frightening cuz those ones are pretty powerful the Swifty upgrades as well kind of silly uh if ruler is going to be
1:05:18
able to collect those as now hype moves over and yeah bro I think have probably afforded themselves a bit of map control
1:05:24
after what they've done so the Drake is going to spawn and immediately does go down hype now with four items complete
1:05:30
all those Evolutions done and Des is in his back pocket this Kaiser is going to be very very hard to kill and in fact
1:05:36
has proved very hard to kill for the entirety of the game as he's sitting deathless right now pretty nice welcome
1:05:42
back here for the uh player on loan from KT yeah I mean hype's just been playing
1:05:48
extremely well obviously did Flash to sacrifice the jungle earlier but wouldn't which any har player would not
1:05:54
he just said look I'm playing really well H it's like it's fine they expect one of us in the reage exactly
1:06:00
exactly and uh you know they're already friends cuz they played together on our K2 Challenger last year so it's
1:06:07
fine and so chovi here in this Sid linee you can see bro pushing forward wanting
1:06:12
to get towards this inner turret if they can void seek is not finding but I guess their role is to
1:06:18
seek and so you don't necessarily have to find is now Morgan going to be able to dash his way out good wave clear here for J though yeah how you just a shock I
1:06:25
mean build with the Jace you're kind of more bruisy your sh don't do that much damage is just dead okay there's the
1:06:31
Twan pulverized from Polo but no follow up for that one as well because closer was nowhere in the vicinity they're
1:06:37
looking now for trovy who ults his way forward they get on top of Polo who gets another puliz I just don't know whether
1:06:42
it's going to be enough although the aapan reain is making things happen hype gets into the back line he's flashing
1:06:48
after ruler and he'll find the void seeker of death my God that did so much
1:06:53
damage but they're unable to take down the Jin who I don't think can even afford to press his ultimate button
1:07:00
because if hype hits him with a W he's just dead and so he's just going to hold on to that one and in the end bro
1:07:06
actually make it work I'm not even sure if they had vision of trovy cuz Hy avoided the old coming out from the Y
1:07:12
I'm not sure if it was blind or not but so some fantastic moves if he got hit by that completely different fight I guess
1:07:18
we're going to see in the replay but just bro even when something goes wrong even when hanack is sacrificed again
1:07:24
they manag to bring it back and ruler is are sitting on four items right like they're they're pretty good ones if you
1:07:29
want a Jin to do late game damage but he still feels like Jin that's the problem
1:07:35
okay so let's have a look yeah kind looking at Joy on the plank here makes his way
1:07:41
in and we see this angle and where is he going oh and he
1:07:47
just avoids it I I guess maybe I don't even know if he had Vision you can't see from his perspective it's beautiful
1:07:52
moves not to gete and then can re-engage here R just can't do anything but he's reloading fumbling the bullets are
1:07:58
falling out of his pockets he's trying to get in his gun he's like his hands are shaking can't get them into the
1:08:04
revolver oh god oh no we've all been there I haven't you don't pick what's a
1:08:12
gun well Morgan he's going to get snared but not too worried about it as oh God
1:08:17
here comes closer with his bazooka the strangle Thorns not really getting enough down as the ultimate now employed
1:08:23
by ruler it hasn't actually landed any kills just yet Bros health bars are starting to fall low though now Clos are
1:08:30
in trouble and another P right here from Polo which is his death throws in the
1:08:35
end so huk and poly both falling down and bro not quite finding the baron fight that they were looking for there
1:08:40
yeah and now opportunity for Gen to move over to they have an insane amount of DPS on Baron right now the chovi and
1:08:47
Canyon and ruler as well the secure so if bro want to stop this have to move in the fight half HP closing not there it's
1:08:53
2v5 right now yeah Kan at full health is so scary as well deadly flourish is going to stop him in his tracks so back
1:08:59
to the baron they go and gen will be a to secure that objective a minute and a half on the infernal Drake as well that
1:09:06
would be Sole for them if they're able to link this Baron into that objective let's have a look at this fight one more
1:09:11
time as bro little bit disjointed on the call yeah unfort she close a can't reach
1:09:17
with a full combo Keen doing a great job of bodyguard there and then here hand back ends up overextending I think the
1:09:23
the area where they're fighting around this uh brush on the opposite side of red it's such a difficult awkward spot
1:09:29
to fight in especially against the Zyra and the Jin yeah the strangle Thorn's location was just huge value so I think
1:09:36
not picking the right environment for their fight has kind of H throw there but still aheading gold they are down in
1:09:42
Baron but geni haven't really had any time to do anything with it wave still in favor of bro with those super minions
1:09:47
pushing in top and now they're taking control of the area they do not want geni to get close to that Dragon yeah
1:09:53
these super minions are really going to help out because ji will need to send someone up
1:09:58
there try and defend but right now ji still very very strong
1:10:05
even though they're 5,000 gold behind a lot of that doesn't really matter here at 35 1/2 minutes it's a lot to do with
1:10:12
who manages to get the fight they're looking for and I'm really glad that you mentioned Canyon because I feel like so
1:10:18
much comes down to how much value this zyro damage can actually bring them because he has been sort of
1:10:24
finished off relatively early hasn't found a lot of value with these strangle thorns in some of these other fights that last one really showed what you can
1:10:31
do if you do manage to get it working well but bro just take control of the dragon and they will be able to take
1:10:37
that one down they traded for an inner turret but that's all to do with this super minion wave moving in towards the
1:10:42
top side of the map and all things considered jengi I mean obviously they get a good amount of gold from it but they get mid tier two and they they lose
1:10:50
a dragon they don't really get anything else from the baron they have a minute to work with it but I I don't see any windows from to push up right now with
1:10:56
how uh the control of the map is so yes ji got the baron yes it closed the lead
1:11:01
a little bit but oh hand back he should be able to get out Tov yeah he should be fine can keep charging that Vault
1:11:08
breaker now at level 16 is not going to have to worry about it too wasn't any Wards behind him cuz I definitely could have seen maybe I mean I I think there's
1:11:14
nothing on the map to play for right now so I don't think they would have gone for it but a choby flank could have been deadly
1:11:20
there got a cheeky little control ward in yeah also hit 18s for almost everyone
1:11:27
jungle is not quite there yet and of course the supports are lagging behind but we are hitting our caps at this
1:11:33
point in time is solar play going to be flashed here by hog the Big Tool now missing but it is a good
1:11:39
flash yeah definitely makes a bit harder to get on the back line especially looking at ruler uh and also just more
1:11:45
opportunities to pick hamach in the future look at uh look at Morgan's items
1:11:51
it's four items this guy has a large health bar yeah interesting enough
1:11:56
seeing Keen go for the serent Fang if you can get damage on like height when he OS yeah or I mean even the shielding
1:12:03
from Morgan as well is pretty significant look at Morgan he's realized that he just doesn't take damage so he may as well walk at them he's Unleashed
1:12:09
I am Cante now oh H rer also going the seeker's arm guard um so presumably bro
1:12:16
will have seen that but that kind of limits the options and chim's ulton for hand back H you know there's Zas on
1:12:22
Canyon Seeker arm guard on ruler Keen is pretty bulky quite Bruiser and chovi is
1:12:28
hard to pin down with yon's kit so this VI value in the late game might be feel
1:12:34
a little bit less and less but I mean speaking of value you talked about the F shoes there is the shoes but you talked
1:12:40
about the Caps as well Ander has the rabadons cap right now and is closing in
1:12:45
on full build uh he is so scary he is going to do so much damage he also is
1:12:52
very squishy so if J are like if finds that like miraculous solar flare for
1:12:58
example it's going to make things a little bit tough but we can see already as well like elixir of iron is there for
1:13:03
polo like we are setting up for like the final fight of this game that's what that arm guard tells you on ruler as
1:13:10
well as a lot of the tech that has been put in I think it's so funny they added the uh the iron rank we have elix of
1:13:16
iron it's just powered by like the the tears of the I am players the tears of
1:13:23
learning League of Legends a little bit too late as all right ji now moving over
1:13:30
well maybe not like maybe you've just been there the whole time you know a good time it's not about winning and
1:13:36
that's what the Bros teach us every single day so that's what we need to be talking about here is nice little qu to come through here as the ulti is
1:13:42
invested by closer Canyon going to be Zing very early like you're saying and
1:13:47
so he going to avoid the engage and now that ultimate's on cool down for now though I mean it's already a quarter of
1:13:53
the way done so yeah it's Tak does have a lot of time yeah and I think that's a
1:13:58
good time to go that play Unfortunately they only got the get like a flash from Canyon uh but that all is going to be
1:14:04
back up for those objectives uh H back playing kind of on the flank here and
1:14:09
we're going to end up with a short window where Baron is up and dragon isn't um definitely becomes
1:14:15
uncomfortable but both teams are one away from Soul so it's a dangerous path there for po as void Seekers not really
1:14:22
finding their Mark at this point in time Des PO is getting pretty annoying just throwing a plant down the auto with the
1:14:28
LeAndre quite a lot H you can see him already about 2/3 HP just from
1:14:34
that and jingi prioritizing the baron side of the fight as we can see I think
1:14:41
deadly flourish comes in the ulti going to get that cleanse out from hype cleans and Flash that's big to secure I mean
1:14:48
Troy almost just died as he di in I don't know about that one hype oh dear
1:14:53
he's going to go into his Z use the rest of bro trying to turn up chovi almost dead but he's not that's the main thing
1:15:00
oh no we were talking about that Challenger energy and it wasn't what we wanted to see Morgan deciding not to
1:15:06
flash get himself out of that one and oh dear that could have been the whole game thrown into the tin can a
1:15:14
critical error there and the thing is because it happens before the baron spawns Genji have time now to get the
1:15:20
baron and move straight over the dragon and get both soul and baron it was so close they've had such good control this
1:15:28
game and bro the last minute might have just fumbled so cut the video guys if
1:15:33
you were a bro lever just um just that wasn't the bit that you wanted to see maybe rewind who didn't pay that bro tax
1:15:40
yeah I mean it must have been someone we needed a little bit of extra time I think HP if he just Z's there this this
1:15:46
would be completely different um I feel like hype took it personally yeah B summ
1:15:51
them re-engage and thing is he misses the he misses the W but even if you hit the W and going to be real I think even
1:15:58
if you kill trovy it doesn't actually it's not the play and then Morgan doesn't want to be in the flash says
1:16:03
look I might just be dead does get hit by the rout the end so maybe we waiting but regardless that is now soul and
1:16:10
baron over the geneng G and they have just about taken well they've evened up the gold but uh a huge boost in a game
1:16:17
like this I've Got a Theory okay my theory is bro were feeling like they
1:16:23
were starting to be in like the we're in the winning position we're not The Underdogs anymore oh yeah they were the
1:16:28
overdogs and so being the overdogs is not really the Bro way yeah and so now
1:16:34
they're back to being back to being the underdogs well are very consistently overdogs they are often yes and I don't
1:16:41
think anyone told bro that no matter how this game was going they would always be The Underdogs we probably should have
1:16:46
communicated that at least to Hype um but yeah uh this in turret not long for
1:16:52
the world I just like I I hate the blame I don't want to put it on anyone but there's going to be someone in the chat who hasn't paid that bro tax and he just
1:16:58
realizing now this might be on you yeah and you might be you might be busying H but that's not how that one goes is they
1:17:04
engage they do find the Gin in that back line but can they get more that is the question Duro taking a lot of damage
1:17:11
trying to taxi his way out but the only way he's getting out is in a body bag double kill for closer and yeah they're
1:17:18
back to The Underdogs and they're back to winning whoever just paid their bro tax it was you I'm scrolling I'm
1:17:24
scrolling Leo and a bunch of numbers you are the best thank you so much for that they
1:17:29
needed it they it's all you Leo everyone give him a shout out gorgeous stuff oh
1:17:36
the energy comes in they finally engage and now long death timers they don't have waves pushed up to the base yet so
1:17:42
not sure it's going to be a game Ender here but they deny the baron push from gen and this game's going to keep on
1:17:48
trucking oh yeah 43 minutes man we were expecting that maybe today would be on the the faster side
1:17:55
um I feel like going we're wrong into a roller coaster and it is going fast it's
1:18:01
going fast but the track is long let's just say that it is a long journey we still cly undulating now bro they can
1:18:08
move up towards the top side if they want to there's an open inhibitor but they don't have a wave and they are just going to back away as oh it is Elder
1:18:15
time it is Elder time let's see whether team Baron can take an elder from Team Elder and you know he has son n's arm
1:18:23
guard rer has full on on but they don't even get him give him a chance to click his buttons beautiful flash engage from
1:18:29
PO hanack is there to make sure there's not a single Moment Like You Can Be There spaming your Z button it ain't
1:18:34
going off yeah and uh that's the Vault breaker into ulti combo from hok so he actually gets to layer that CC a whole
1:18:41
lot further and you just don't last very long if you are a gin unfortunately yeah just just great moves
1:18:47
honestly and I feel like every time something goes wrong for bro have to
1:18:52
bounce back that's a lot of damage coming now from this Kaiser as well as you know the void stuff now completed
1:18:57
for closer as well he's so dangerous hype actually weaving in a bit of extra
1:19:02
like ad into the build also yeah selling off the uh static shiv for a kraken
1:19:08
Slayer I think it makes sense I mean especially you look at the I mean everyone's health bars as well are like
1:19:13
just getting larger so having to cut that down Mak some sense we seen like more pal morus on both uh chovi and Keen
1:19:20
banshe is going to come through from Canyon we've got the Abyssal mask and J they know they're dealing with a lot of magic damage star night there see ruler
1:19:26
sell the shiv and get a collector wa okay not exactly collector
1:19:32
not not night me feel like scales that well I'm not going to say that that's the late game item of choice that I was looking at um but I'm not raw and I
1:19:40
never pretend to be as grasping root is going to Land once again but he pulverize is going to be in response
1:19:46
strangle Thorns not getting a whole lot of value and my God if hype ever lands these and they're just dead as Canyon
1:19:53
does have to go golden into the back line go closer and he keeps himself alive between the veils and he's going
1:19:58
to be able to get out and bro they just take two from the top side of the map they're going to see what they can do
1:20:04
versus three yeah CL is going to recall he's got TP can get back in they got to make sure the health bars stay high
1:20:10
ruler's old can do so much work here if people are low in health but it looks like they're going to TP in closer sorry
1:20:17
CL already TP ingan he's got six items he can just walk at this gin look at him
1:20:23
he's just he's like I'm going to block it for you guys my health bar does not go down but rulers does as we can see
1:20:29
Killer Instinct into the backline once again but this time for hype it's going to work the ulti from chovy doesn't work
1:20:35
at all and he times it well that time hype's going to go golden and the
1:20:40
Bros in the one game out of the three that they've played so far that we thought that they would not get a look
1:20:47
in uh-uh this is the Casper Cup champions doing it again against gen
1:20:53
this is all your pro taxes pay for oh yeah once again huge shout out to Leo in
1:20:59
the chat I saw that he said oops here's my bro tax and did you see what happened
1:21:04
in that bot Lane moment he put it in it it that's if you ever need proof that broad tax makes a difference you've seen
1:21:10
it right there and the thing is it's only one game but one game might be all bro needs to avoid that dreaded bottom
1:21:16
play Spot in the group exactly game score is super important between them and bfx so this win even if they end up
1:21:22
losing the series after this makes huge but honestly with some of the play they had there I think gen's got to be a
1:21:28
little bit concerned right now I think gen needs to be focusing up moving into this one I imagine like I think every
1:21:34
week you're like which match do we put the most focus on and it probably wasn't the one against bro that was their big
1:21:41
mistake and so now going into game two I think we're going to see a we have to see a very different draft things like
1:21:47
this but the way bro played especially the way closer played as you can see there him and hype really just doing the
1:21:53
damage when they needed even though hypee went completely insane mode he has he has to do it there's got
1:22:00
to be got to get the end out so you can finish off the game and they doing absurd damage by the way in this one despite the fact uh they lost but closer
1:22:08
doing so much work on this pick surviving at the end on such low HP just some great plays from bro I think
1:22:14
sometimes you can look at the game and be like hey was geni under I think bro really just leveled up and we saw some of that c up energy we've been missing
1:22:21
so dearly oh yeah oh what an incredible game one and so far as far as leaders
1:22:28
for p are concerned I think closer is probably going to get some value but they're going to need to win another
1:22:34
game in the series we're going to take a short break the space is going to have the pleasure of breaking down that
1:22:39
gorgeous game then we'll get into game two see you there
1:22:50
[Music]
1:23:21
a you
1:23:52
[Music]
1:24:01
[Music]
1:24:23
spe foree
1:24:58
teleport to come in from Z as well Ro's going to have to yeah they do get
1:25:04
Vision look here the magnet Storm from Delight into the back line is gorgeous
1:25:09
BD tries to get out of there but Z just goes all out [Music]
1:25:14
and looks to destroy him peanut is going to be the first one to go down though but now DEA oh God he just targets dock
1:25:22
every time perfect lying on the floor floor as well and look at hle they are
1:25:27
just mowing them down Zer in about 100 health is still going to
1:25:34
[Music] survive and that's just going to be free
1:25:41
as meanwhile a couple of 80 carries going head tohe the barrier though available and he jumps over ruler just
1:25:47
to die [Music]
1:26:05
let's see whether he can find a way in here to try and get something stolen away SI can show up going wide huk in
1:26:10
position like this could be a difficult Baron as sponge decides to turn it he is
1:26:16
able to lock that one down huk gets in there but doesn't get away with it and that is Rich locking down that
1:26:23
kill they do manage to take down the Wukong with the knock off but just gigantic they take down andil but hype
1:26:30
is still in so much trouble lazy Feld wants to flash in and he will do
1:26:39
so uh in the lck and he's got the talent to do it now Canyon is going to get
1:26:45
isolated here once again the V does come in but look at that huge Redemption heal and they just don't have the damage
1:26:52
they're finally going to get onto that backline but in giant rocket is going to hit DEA as well but he is going in so
1:26:58
Viper that's a couple of kills down the
1:27:06
r oh the G coming in and now you've got a front line for ruler to just go
1:27:13
absolutely insane in this fight SE oh he's for peut actually he's got it maybe
1:27:19
one rocket no not quite but he will absolutely take at least a triple kill
1:27:25
in this one as the big one does rain down are
1:27:33
they going to be able to get in here Sher just running forward there's the face breaker it is going to be loose to the locks down the dragon but can they
1:27:39
win the fight that's the question flash out here from showmaker superplex to get life out of the fight very very low
1:27:45
there's the double sleeve Los gets the watch out he and they do need to watch out Dudu trying to fight three but he
1:27:51
still has to FL away
1:27:56
and berserker's under the turret but I don't know whether that safety is there it is the queue comes through watch out
1:28:01
e yet again as BL to get the triple
1:28:25
you say you're not afraid to
1:28:33
die take off the around
1:28:39
chest
1:28:45
left your do you really if it wases away take a right
1:28:54
rough as you can tell you as
1:29:19
[Music]
1:29:28
[Music]
1:29:49
in the group with the lck Champions the world champions it requires the kespa
1:29:54
Cup champions the pull group Baron back to life taking down what is considered
1:30:01
the strongest team in the lck Bros up one to zero over gen G no one beats the
1:30:08
Bros 10 times in a row Deon here alongside chronicler and wolf that's
1:30:14
right it was 10 times ago a different roster with General umpty the last time
1:30:19
Bon found themselves a victory over gen yeah I'm pretty sure that was when they two Z gen in like the last week of
1:30:25
Summer J then went on to win the tournament but this is also a moment of redemption for the other team that got
1:30:31
close to beating geni and didn't actually pull for bnk I was there I was angry I was not believing until the
1:30:37
Nexus actually fell I did not trust but I'm so happy because both the level of
1:30:42
play from bro plus the level of play from genen warrants this outcome and it is a really good sign not for Gen but
1:30:50
for the lck when teams get disrespected and they slam their fist down that's
1:30:55
right uh it's the longest game of the season bro did have a few mistakes a few errors uh a bit of a rough one to close
1:31:00
it out with UL yeah we taking a look of that a little bit later but uh kind of
1:31:06
an underperformance from chovi the Ona pick to me didn't really hit that well for this draft I don't think was a bad pick they had the Zyra pick in the
1:31:11
jungle but into the Aurora match up if the Aurora plays really well which closer absolutely did and gave him a ton
1:31:16
of trouble plus Canyon's really big error at level three you can really snowball that lane and closers advantas
1:31:22
were pretty insane all right let's take take a look at some of the highlights here with the first one being over at Aon 26 minutes in the Bros take the
1:31:29
fight I'm just so happy that bro saw a dragon being taken and they actually did
1:31:36
stuff they're not just sitting that they're like oh we can't take this RIS scary no more bro and Brew because
1:31:43
thanks to Morgan and Pa standing guard there's no access to this objective and and because of like you said like
1:31:50
there's there's no axess they have control of the tri brush they also have an aurora it's really tough to win this fight and then they still keep those
1:31:55
ultimates cuz ji have to back out here when they decide to take this Baron and initially seems like a pretty greedy Baron take but they spot the chovy flank
1:32:02
instantly and turn to punish him so chovi gets deleted and then hambach can get into the backline and get on top of ruler right away and ultimately there's
1:32:08
really no risk here for bro yes if you lose the fight swimmingly like if ji absolutely clock you here even with the
1:32:14
reses you'll lose the baron but they actually are brave enough because they have that oton buff in the reses to
1:32:19
actually go for this fight they still have those same zoning ultimates and if ch's flank is a success then probably ji win the fight but
1:32:25
they're able to spot it react very quickly hok instantly turns on the ruler once ch's blown up great team fighting
1:32:31
here from bro this is the bro we were hoping to see after the kespa Cup Championship that's right a lack of
1:32:36
hesitation there immediate jumping on in I mean even hype there on the kaisa which is unfortunately the second part
1:32:43
of the Highlight which we are now going to reenact dramatically using our fantastic uh ma yeah unfortunately I
1:32:50
didn't actually take a take a video of this happening but nean was already he was getting he was NY you know he's like
1:32:56
I want the Bros to win so bad and then the Poke comes in right everything is
1:33:01
fine hype gets out he's like oo oh that's a lot of damage that's a lot of damage okay he hits
1:33:08
W and at this point Deon has already gone through like 15 emotional oh oh are
1:33:13
they going to do it are they going to do it no cuz he misses the
1:33:20
W no and I I'm I'm only giving half the energy like a one out of six on this one
1:33:26
my voice doesn't even go high he was like no no no no my cannot match
1:33:32
deons in this moment because this is where it felt like the game was what are we doing Bros what are we doing Bros oh
1:33:39
come on what are we doing Bros uh side note Deon did not predict bro and it hurts him a lot uh but hopefully they
1:33:45
win the series cuz wouldn't that be the coolest thing ever and so with that after that one again I love the energy
1:33:52
and the hype that uh uh Head Hunter hype brings to the rest of this roster but I
1:33:58
did think it was done after that it was a classic bro moment a bro throw if you will but they defend down on the bottom
1:34:05
side of the map and shut the door on gen here and the one man that had been playing an impeccable game together with
1:34:12
Kean this whole time ruler finally gets caught I think ruler this catch
1:34:17
obviously is rough really nicely down by hok to get him there clip him with the flash Q he even had a stopwatch and his
1:34:23
Flash big mistake from him but it obviously in this game we need to talk about the other three players which are Canyon and
1:34:30
chovi but even Duro I think not having the impact that we wanted to but that mid jungle 22 that's the best mid jungle
1:34:37
2v2 in the lck by the way it's it's weird too to that like after being so
1:34:42
punished all early mid game they get one win and they just go straight back to like oh we're geni the we're the best
1:34:47
and they don't do their due diligence here even though ruler has those tools and feels very safe and Canyon's there to help peel with his ultimate they feel
1:34:54
like maybe yeah we can get this done we could just hard push and win the game but there's another punish coming through from bro who don't hesitate in
1:35:00
this really important game this win might be what pushes them over the line they're tied now with bfx any other wins
1:35:06
could mean that they actually still could get out of the group yeah my fear though is that uh closer has looked
1:35:11
great on Aurora and Aurora's already been played
1:35:16
so we'll see what the Bros cook up here will they be able to close it out for the upset of the cup or will jeng battle
1:35:22
back and do what they do let's see welcome back everyone thank you so much
1:35:27
Deon and uh chroniker and wolf I do think that the dramatic reenactment based on what we heard probably should
1:35:33
have been done by wolf I'm not going to lie uh wasn't dramatic enough for me I didn't feel the energy I feel like the
1:35:40
the movements from chronic are fine vocal energy we should have just had wolf talking and then chrona just moving
1:35:47
around yeah yes yes together you make a perfect Deon reenactor Joo takes a lot
1:35:52
of work to so next time with the next reenactment please do it that way and I
1:35:58
I'd love to see it just with a just bad dubbing of Chronicle sounds brilliant all right let's uh dive into it uh we
1:36:05
have the draft on the way here and jeni now over to the blue side and should be
1:36:11
able to get back on the horse and make things happen but we'll see whether the Bros have cooked up anything else for us
1:36:18
because they've got one they've tasted victory now and that is very very dangerous for everyone here in the lck
1:36:25
cup yeah and you know I'm not going to say that the team is scared of someone but an Essa and then Anon ban you know
1:36:33
gent looking pretty that's the TIY right there you know they're they're paying it their lord has demanded the taxes
1:36:40
absolutely uh does mean some of the ad carry picks we saw left open last time specifically the varus nidle Sor not bar
1:36:48
Baris Ash um all going to be left open likely yet Rado going to get taken away cl's on You Can't Ban varis and Ash so
1:36:55
maybe just ban one or maybe just leave them both open and pick one of the others we'll see n is still open and
1:37:02
available something Canyon is pretty proficient on maybe just Banning the N I think if you commit to the N ban in game
1:37:09
one you have to keep it throughout the series and they are going to do so and so Varys or Ash one of those two likely
1:37:15
to be picked up here yeah could end up just not taking either right now yeah I guess you don't really have to uh and
1:37:21
knowing you can trade later on but likely going to pick up an ad carry in this uh total rotation so have the
1:37:27
option to do that there uh hopefully not a quy oh looks like looks like they're
1:37:33
going to lean on the varis right now um might mean that we see HP pick up the ash in return or I mean could go in a
1:37:40
different direction it did get quite ban heavy with the 8 carries last time around um going the second rotation yeah
1:37:46
might have cooked something as well like you never know like uh there might be some surprise pick towards that bottom side but there is a lot up and available
1:37:53
so I don't know whether you necessarily have to go all in in that direction yeah and especially when you
1:37:58
know there's like a varus who is pretty immobile um definitely the option actually ja pretty quickly yeah Jack
1:38:05
Edge makes a lot of sense um Jack ash makes less sense to me I think you could
1:38:10
have just grabbed Jack SED if you wanted to leave the ashel 3 um unless they thought that maybe geni were going to go
1:38:16
for one of the old archery bottom Lanes like uh Gushi ker used to do but I don't know whether that even works anymore
1:38:22
yeah not that's really something I'd expect for them to bring out I feel like J is more confident engag supports but
1:38:28
you know you never know so uh maybe just want to show less off their hand so far in the draft or maybe they wanted Kenyon
1:38:36
to play Sani that' be interesting as the gall to be locked try he looked so good on this
1:38:43
pick earlier on of course his most iconic play of all time was on the Gallo as well hitting that fiveman taunt you
1:38:50
all remember it it was beautiful what's he going to lock in here for Canyon though I'm expecting it's going to be Canyon's pick unless uh there is going
1:38:57
to be an answer to the Jacks to come through yeah I think z a Bru it something like zenz makes a lot of sense
1:39:03
um could even G some like Wukong I I feel like you need that damage threat when you go in the Gallo especially it's going to be that tankier Gallo yep um
1:39:10
gives you a really strong mid jungle and now it's kind of kind of difficult for bro because uh you need to kind of lock
1:39:16
in something I feel into the Gallo now uh before the bands come through but that means your jungle pool might get
1:39:22
pinched a decent amount I will say though picking zinz out into the Jacks never feels that ideal no um and
1:39:29
obviously you know it's likely going to be Jax top into zenza jungle but anytime you have to interact with Jax his Counter Strike just kind of says no to
1:39:36
your entire kid not going to be doing too much there is the poppy going to be taken away as
1:39:42
we're just looking to get rid of kean's answers to the Jacks that sort of matchup is the only one we're really
1:39:47
needing to protect here on the side of the Bros but look to see junglers hitting the deck so maybe it's like
1:39:54
Wukong Sani or something like that to be banned away here huk does have a pretty deep champion pool so I don't think he's
1:40:00
going to be too worried but getting rid of some of the things that the zenzo really doesn't want to deal with is probably the way to do it Sani a good
1:40:06
start yeah I think sajwani makes a lot of sense uh to take away um especially comboing well with the Jacks uh I think
1:40:12
Wukong you could take away as well although I think Wukong might have a little bit of issues sometimes into like
1:40:17
the Gallo just being able to cover for uh Keen uh be interested to see if they ban
1:40:23
away any supports as well here apart from that Rado I mean I guess the poppy as well was a support ban mostly gone
1:40:29
untouched whereas like last draft it was kind of more heavily focused towards the support it was like well this is kind of
1:40:34
what's left available y um things like car St on the cards things like the r
1:40:40
still available um by the way there's a lot of synergy we do need Keen to pick Master G
1:40:46
top so that we have the you know the Champions with way too many uh glasses sockets or whatever it is see like the
1:40:54
Jax's little mask thing you got like the same one then you got a bird match up in the mid lane chicken versus pigeon like
1:41:00
it's pretty cool I'm sure there's another spear user that we could throw into the jungle can't think on the top
1:41:06
of my head n was a spear user and she got bed oh no hey wait there's a lance though on re so it kind of lines up yeah
1:41:13
unfortunately real jungle not really as much of a thing we do see the re come out and then geni toying with the idea
1:41:20
of a Lulu in this situation Lulu Varys that's pointing us towards a
1:41:26
little bit more of the onit variety of the varis one of R's greatest Champions as that's an Urgot an old Keen
1:41:34
special that' be fun yeah interesting um I also one thing
1:41:39
I really don't like about the Lulu is I feel like Gallo works so fantastically as like follow-up engage you need
1:41:45
someone to lean the lead the charge and you know as much as zenz can go in he even has an ability called acious charge
1:41:52
he does you can't hold people in place until you have your knockup ready and it's sometimes difficult to stack that up immediately wo uh oh Leon coming in
1:41:59
for hand back quickly so a lot of confidence in that pick um definitely feels like geni have quite a sort of
1:42:05
defensive counter dive sort of comp like if you come into them they have a lot of tools to play around with they have a
1:42:11
lot of DPS uh between like the Varys and the a god um I do feel like like Bros
1:42:19
composition is very flexible though with how these fights are going because they so much Mobility it's only really hyp
1:42:25
that's going to struggle to move around a lot and reposition himself but if they can make sure that they keep their Ash
1:42:32
safe you know make sure these arrows are landing where they need to it does have some of the answers but like you said
1:42:37
there's a lot more cohesion on uh jeni this time around but I will say I feel like one of the things with Jeni's
1:42:42
composition is if they do fall behind they don't really have that much to setup plays I mean if someone oversteps
1:42:50
absolutely they can but mostly they are like okay you need to run into us we want to hold our ground we want to have
1:42:56
control of an area if they get ahead I think he'll feel obnoxious for bro but I think if gen fall behind which we did
1:43:01
obviously see last game they could have some trouble and there's tools like the ash Arrow like the real that can set up
1:43:07
plays and pick people isolated it's pretty cute geni players are all dancing we're caught on our phone we don't know
1:43:13
we can't really read the sign couldn't read the sign anyway uh but it's fine she didn't actually trigger into it but
1:43:20
here we go so kean's favorite champion towards the top side of the map his Urgot that he really loves bringing out
1:43:26
and is going to be a decent answer into the Jacks what I kind of feel like but there is a lot that bro can work with
1:43:32
here as well pretty even footing as far as the draft geni probably more locked in here in game
1:43:39
[Music]
1:43:49
two all right Brion fans need to be a bit louder here in L Park but I can see you guys in the twitch chat and so I
1:43:56
know that you're making up for it as ji going to be backing away here after the
1:44:02
Bros took a bit of damage as we can see doing some work yeah strong level one
1:44:07
though from the Bro comp so able to really Force ji out her kind of just on
1:44:12
the sidelines watching as the jungle gets warded out do you see some pings
1:44:17
coming out though they have seen information has been Place rer had already moved up as well so actually
1:44:23
going to be spotted on that Ward which is pretty cute oh it's I hate this have you seen ruler's
1:44:32
Keystone oh God no poke varis with poke varis with a
1:44:38
Lulu I really hope that he's just doing that for the laning phase there's I feel
1:44:43
like losing lethal tempos on hi varus is so really not great oh this is not I
1:44:49
don't like this really an enchanter I mean okay I am going to say
1:44:56
as a caveat uhhuh we did often see way back in the day things like Lulu made zenza jungle so like Lulu does sync up
1:45:03
well with zenza but I still think having an on hit Baris is so much better than
1:45:08
having a poke barus and I feel like there's not like it's not obscene range on the side of bro right like they do
1:45:16
have like decent range but like I think he could still find a way to play especially with the amount of peeling
1:45:22
tools that are available for Gen yeah it's missed opportunity there but if
1:45:28
you're a bro lever certainly going to be helping the stocks rise uh for them as Kee getting the Top
1:45:35
Lane treatment um this is just going to be the sad time that uh the Top Lane is going to have um same can be said for
1:45:40
Morgan as we saw earlier on was just taking way too much damage yeah P down a
1:45:45
fair bit by the Lulu the thing with having like a Lulu in these Lan stop situations especially one with heal lot
1:45:51
less dive threat but very hard to avoid the harass just you can consistently do
1:45:56
without taking Tower hits uh which can be pretty annoying yeah we don't have Canyon towards his bottom side so Morgan
1:46:03
is going to be safe for the moment you can see Duro continuing to be frustrating I love the squid skin as
1:46:09
well on the Lulu very C definitely uh the best one the it's the goggly eyes the goggly eyes is just soal
1:46:16
good okay maybe that's it maybe we like I really want to play poke bars here
1:46:21
Lulu's probably not the best best and then duro's like wait see my skin and then they get in the like R's
1:46:29
like I really don't think this is that and then he sees the skin he's like okay I'm sold it's it's about Vibes and The
1:46:35
Vibes are impeccable it's perfect and they're going to they're going to play Splatoon later as well and they're just
1:46:40
going to have a really good time maybe they lose the game but it's about bonding is exactly exactly and
1:46:46
it's about cleaning up the paint and stuff like that you know that's what it's all about as Canyon is now down
1:46:52
here on this wave to look for a kill onto Morgan and he is Ja but he's also
1:46:58
Jax like it's just going it's going to be tough they're waiting for him to press his buttons but they may not even need to as Counterstrike does finally
1:47:05
come up the turret's getting frustrating is another dive here towards the top side paulu tanks as much as he possibly
1:47:11
can and uh yes there is the death of Morgan towards the bottom side as the sonic wave oh God calculated this time
1:47:18
from hype I guess the hell pot running definitely making a differ you can see how it's not just that the towers do
1:47:25
more damage but they take longer to cool down so the damage was still ramped up when hyp like aggro got very dangerous H
1:47:31
and I do want to credit ji's dive on the bot side H so the thing they do here is jro leads with the polymorph Canyon
1:47:38
Stacks up his Q so one Auto in the tower two Auto polymorph knock up and he nearly dies before he even gets to
1:47:45
Counter Strike y they then wait their time they let the tower reset and then it's it's so easy there just to finish
1:47:51
off and dur didn't get it with that uh glitter Lance that was coming in right when he was dying yeah I know he wants
1:47:57
to steal R's pen but that wasn't that wasn't close to a pen he just Tred to steal his kill there here H hype doesn't
1:48:03
let the tower fully cool down and it gets a little bit dangerous but the health pot was running the entire time
1:48:09
so maybe just saved him there drink potions ladies and gentlemen absolutely
1:48:14
both teams getting the dive off now Morgan in a bit of trouble yeah does find a bit of a stun with that Counterstrike but not getting quite as
1:48:20
much value got to be careful of these shotgun knes as we'll see whether ke's going to be
1:48:26
out of disain on top of this guy take him down jji pushing in towards his top side
1:48:32
as we do have some Australian Lanes love to see it you must feel right at home I am as all right I is going to avoid that
1:48:39
piercing Arrow serrated dirt coming in there for ruler so confirmation that no funny business uh as closer is the wrong
1:48:47
direction for that ability I would say as stroby is going to be very happy in melee range yeah a lot of good trading
1:48:53
coming out from gen G right now and especially that well I guess Top Lane now match up between uh ruler and jro
1:49:00
and hype and po double range especially in ear D on the varis yeah will have a lot of pressure feeling pretty good at
1:49:07
least hype is able to collect some of the farm here utilizing his volleys correctly yeah and also there's a pretty
1:49:13
big payoff uh in terms of the fact that they got a couple of PL down bot as well
1:49:19
you know Tower's bot Lane still quite a bit weaker than those in the top side
1:49:24
wellock now moving over towards the dragon angle yeah ke's just teleported
1:49:29
in as well as they expecting him near these grubs but hok's going to come down towards his bottom side good disdain to
1:49:35
get Keen out of there but the Safeguard forward Tempest and and the Q is going to miss but I have a feeling Keen
1:49:41
is still dead there it is Leap strike and the Empower and that is the kill yeah nice little gift for Morgan here
1:49:48
who does need to be strong in this game tping in that far up and especially the fact that he didn't have flash even
1:49:54
though hanack doesn't miss a que he holds it for so long ke's trying to dodge it and just ends up going down and
1:49:59
it's a pretty massive play for bro Morgan will appreciate that extra gold not just from the kill but also he gets
1:50:05
a plate there and a nice and farm now oh Canyon oh I think he was spotted yeah
1:50:11
yeah yeah just barely though it was almost genius he's still just going to pick it up and maybe humar can actually
1:50:18
rotate around but as you can see here they are pinging it yeah there's no one here to back up uh hanack which is the
1:50:23
concern cuz chovy can move in uh and this is important that chovi is here because hanack Le can easily steal away
1:50:30
NE objective with the that's two objectives immediately though here for Gen that's pretty massive a good start
1:50:36
yeah they are you know one more objective away from just putting their sandals on immediately yeah I mean it's
1:50:42
one of those scenarios where you'll have the upgrade before people have their Tier Two Boots and here yeah just really have extended uh was a good flip though
1:50:49
from keen and then they're just ordering and and holding the Q he does Dodge it in the end but just not enough
1:50:56
unfortunately yeah nicely picked up there from bro though and gold dead even
1:51:01
but as you can see those Feats of Strength starting to stack up for Gen they've got a hex tech dragon as well
1:51:06
pretty valuable as far as an individual Drake is concerned so there's a little bit of power that isn't really
1:51:11
Illustrated in the coffers at the top of the screen there yeah it is one of those situations
1:51:17
though where it's like hex is a nice dragon to stat you get but it means you're not getting hex Soul also not an
1:51:22
infernal Soul so the individual dragons are nice be definitely thinking will
1:51:27
this pay off in the long run and Keen definitely playing a lot more respectful Now does not want to get burned again
1:51:34
yeah very interested in how this game is going to go you see hype making his way back towards that top side of the map
1:51:40
has himself a little slingshot as well as his pickaxe getting closer and closer to item number one so is ruler of course
1:51:46
stacking up his tier now as well and where is this next objective going to be coming from looks like it's
1:51:52
going to be second round of grubs that we're going to be fighting over and I don't think giving away six grubs to gen
1:51:58
with this composition is really going to be a good idea yeah I mean giving away six scubs in general but you'd also just immediately give over the Patza strength
1:52:05
um which is pretty significant this early I mean those base extra stats you
1:52:10
get from upgrading your tto boots it's it's just Amplified the earlier you get them oh yeah and Keen still having a fine time
1:52:18
like this is still Urgot right he is pretty frustrating to deal with in the laning phase his arrows going to connect immediately gets the cleanse out from
1:52:25
rer nicely done there from hype trading arrows there and turns out that hype's arrow is a little bit more uh
1:52:31
frightening when it is just one of them yeah they definitely nered the cool down a while ago back when Ash support was a
1:52:37
big thing but it should be starting to come up about when the grubs respawn so
1:52:42
it's kind of like the perfect timing where you bur the Summoner and you're looking to have the ability back for the objective that's coming up Y and rer
1:52:49
won't have the cleanse uh which is the main thing Morgan happily picking up uh CS where he
1:52:56
can Top Lane is really not eaten well as far as the farm is concerned having a look in the mid lane we're getting very
1:53:03
quickly towards 100 not quite there yet as po moves over not going to find much
1:53:08
more than a taunt but he isn't too worried about it yeah it's very hard for Clos to do any meaningful damage to CH I
1:53:15
mean it was already if you're playing into Gallo it's hard to do meaningful damage but now that it's like spector's cow Rush Gallo it's just like
1:53:23
at least he's not going to be doing that much damage to you I guess there's that yeah it's kind of just a a very passive
1:53:29
Lane just clear the wave throw a little autos at him just to keep him wise and then move on although the the the
1:53:36
passive Auto Attack Just does a lot of damage feels like it does a lot of damage it do skills with Mr as well so
1:53:41
actually does get a boost him that too oh speaking of which we're going to be able to check it out here as the crash down is going to connect onto chovy the
1:53:47
Flash Forward it picks up Canyon but he's immediately able to press that ultimate piercing Arrow coming in
1:53:53
doesn't really get too much there as chovi maybe didn't want to Justice punch in that direction Morgan got over here
1:53:59
no one's dead yet which is kind of crazy some low health bars as far as ke and closer are concerned but otherwise
1:54:05
people kind of relatively healthy yeah very Scrappy fight a lot of ultimat bur right now geni only have ke bro have
1:54:13
both handb back and hype so the arrow and the kick oh kind of Big Value there yeah a little bit more in terms of
1:54:19
spells available that's a Teleport Joy I mean he is he is Gallo so he's going to be okay but uh both teams really want to
1:54:27
contest these grubs oh Q going to miss there from hok immediately does take a piercing Arrow as Canyon picking up a
1:54:34
few of these grubs I don't think hok's going to let him have all of them but any that geni can pick up means like
1:54:40
void mites and all that sort of stuff can be a little bit of trouble bro going to move in all right arrow is going to
1:54:46
find ruler in the backline completely insane here as Morgan now diving forward find The Counter Strike the kick is
1:54:54
gorgeous onto ruler as well and he'll even find the Q trovy manages to take
1:54:59
down the pigeon on the back end of the fight but they don't care about that bro looking to grab three grubs for
1:55:04
themselves those two ultimates they still had they got massive value from able to how hit that that was sick
1:55:12
thread of the needle honestly uh that amount of people who were in front and ruler just getting caught doesn't quite
1:55:18
have that cleanse which he burned earlier the perfect timing for it and the reward able to get all three of those grubs so
1:55:25
closing the Gap a little bit in terms of those Fe of strength and also equalize
1:55:30
in turns of those just huge play and you know how we were looking at it at 7 and 1/2 minutes and of course bro won the
1:55:36
game and things like that but it's now 12 and half minutes bro have Advantage oh man jro nearly walked in the block it
1:55:42
but then I guess thought ruler was going to Morgan gets the stun H back gets the kick just everything landing on a ruler
1:55:49
there and then chovy just cleaned up a kill on the back side getting the here but not really much more you can do than
1:55:54
that it wasn't a stomp fight from bro but they got what they wanted now Dragon going down very quickly yeah that is
1:56:01
just going to be F of strength if they're able to do this PO getting the information but there's not a whole lot they can do about it it's huk moves over
1:56:07
and he's just there to see it fall down and so it's Kem
1:56:12
Soul woohoo you know it was that's the thing that happens two strong early dragons and you end up with a bit of a
1:56:19
and you're here right so like I mean obviously it wasn't going to be Cloud Soul let's just say that you know I've
1:56:25
had a few of those so far um I think we would Jew uh a chch soul I think we were
1:56:30
and ultimately this is good for bro because I think they kind of realized that we went on the map in time to get
1:56:36
the dragon we don't want to in to try and contest it they get the feat of strength it's unfortunate but it's whatever I mean most of in fact the only
1:56:44
person on on gen who actually has T2 boots zero so they're not getting that much benefit now but when a team has two
1:56:50
dragons already and then the Soul is chem Tech you kind of like you know things could be a lot worse yeah it
1:56:55
certainly could although jji pretty happy that they got those two DRS because they're the good ones you know as at least that um Kem Soul could
1:57:02
actually work out for a few of these uh Champions right like Morgan has a good way of like mitigating uh being dead you
1:57:10
know at low health so you can utilize some of those benefits and things like that I think there are ways to make it work bu Champions I mean things like
1:57:16
zenza things like Gallo like these Champions definitely are a lot better at benefiting from chch Soul than squishy
1:57:22
Champions but it's still it's no he yeah it's no Cloud yeah it's no Cloud you're
1:57:28
not you're not getting that extra mov imagine having like the upgraded swifties and Cloud soul my God ma 10 you
1:57:35
just like Ramis PE imminently exactly H we're not going to have that
1:57:40
so why why are we talking about these fun things that we can't have we should talk about what the fun things that are in the game right
1:57:46
now the plants that loves so much yeah yeah yeah like the Mega scri Bloom and
1:57:53
the mega honey and the Mega Blast cone oh I like speed up fruit I'm actually I'm into that yeah you know is watching
1:58:00
home and he's like neat I love all these plants he is saying that I guarantee
1:58:06
it as closer Lim comes Landing going to be out to tag him there it's going to stop him from getting close enough to
1:58:11
this turret you can see Kane actually making some pretty good use of uh of his buttons to take that one down pretty
1:58:18
quickly first AR blood not as much of a big deal um at this Point given the fact the feat of strength have gone down but
1:58:24
it is still a fair bit of money if they are able to collect it as trovy slight level advantage over Morgan here who's
1:58:30
still looking for that level 11 take over to level two ulti yeah interesting with these Lane assignments I feel like
1:58:35
they favor him bro having the Jacks into oh ruler going to walk into it he didn't see it has to cleanse get himself out of
1:58:43
that one the uh they're just heat seeking they are like hype just knows he's downloaded
1:58:48
ruler I feel like at this point R's like maybe I just need to get an ed of Knight cuz I think he's probably going to build
1:58:55
one of those yeah but uh the sooner the better yeah for sure but those arrows just consistently connecting you be in
1:59:02
the cleanse this one's a little bit closer to the herald so maybe not going to be a factor there cu the arrow won't
1:59:07
be up but that dragon in 2 minutes that cleans won't be available um at the start of the fight and we we were joking
1:59:14
around a little bit after that last game and we were thinking like what did Edgar tell to to ruler in between these games
1:59:21
and I'm not sure man but it must have rattled him because cuz the the Bros are
1:59:26
really doing something here they they've they figured out gen G and Edgar of course did help you know who was then
1:59:33
Samsung Galaxy but pick up a world title so the Bros now utilizing that
1:59:39
wealth of experience got the r will title exactly one step at a time they got the C the cup title see what else
1:59:47
they can get as the rift heral is going to reset ji all in position now just Brute Force bro over this one there is a
1:59:54
mega cone so uh hanar could get here pretty quickly does find a q over let's see whether he goes in for this steal
2:00:01
almost an opportunity but decides that they do not really mind about it as they're trading a tower on the bottom
2:00:07
side so of course Harold generally going to be able to help get you one Tower uh and so if you've already taken one uh
2:00:13
then that's pretty good that's first her blood as well going over to Morgan which is pretty nice is now closer looking for an opportunity onto chovy shifts the
2:00:19
Sands but doesn't shifting quite far enough yeah feels like playing with a lot of restraint here you know they fish with the opportunity to steal but
2:00:24
they're like look we get a free Tower bot Lane if we don't fight you know as much as Harold is powerful cuz you can
2:00:30
choose where to place it most the times you're getting a tower to Harold so they'll just take the tower in the first
2:00:36
place obviously Harold does give a bit of gold which is nice and they end up making a trade which I think is fine for
2:00:42
them I will say though you know as much as we went big fans of the Poke varus
2:00:48
pairing with the Lulu this is really where the virus is shining in the mid game uh ising justk
2:00:54
fromed aamp defitely knows suain is the key here at least has that static Shi
2:01:01
already done an interesting choice want to be able to get a bit more wave clear and
2:01:07
things like that and hok now moving towards this chem Tech Dragon might be bro's
2:01:13
opportunity to try and get one of those as they do have a control Ward on it hype continuing to as you say illustrate
2:01:20
how frustrating it can be now moving towards the rest of his team po baai out a few abilities here and
2:01:27
there gets in there and they will be able to start this one off so it looks like we're not going to see a soulle point from gen unless Canyon makes his
2:01:33
way in try and steal this one away right now trovy moving down towards this fight
2:01:40
as well that heroic entrance going to be an opportunity as po taking a lot of poke damage the rip K being thrown down
2:01:46
in the middle of this one as well just to create chaos great kick out but now can they actually win the fight that's
2:01:51
the question as Polo The Flash magnet storm but just gets thrown out of there beautiful
2:01:57
mitigation and peel we mentioned that ji has this in their composition they'll now be able to move Shelly towards the
2:02:04
mid lane and grab that out of turret they're going to be able to grab a second charge as well some extra value
2:02:11
and possibly yeah even this inner turret at the same time so yeah grats on your chem Tech Drake that's two turrets he
2:02:17
going to lose yeah good job there from jro you know part of the value of the Lulu into the r specifically being able
2:02:23
to interrupt that crash down despite Po's Flash and because they red them I I just don't think geni care at all about
2:02:29
a single chem Tech Dragon but getting two towers made of that Herald that's the value you
2:02:35
want but we got the secure you know that was that was the main thing right like huk he nailed the kick so cut the video
2:02:41
there and you're feeling pretty happy about it um outside of that a little bit rough so geni now moved back to a gold
2:02:48
lead nothing no end of the world type scenarios and you can see that you know Morgan still has that Advantage Morgan
2:02:55
certainly feels like the win condition here for bro at this point in time especially cuz it just feels like
2:03:00
there isn't that much damage to really cut him down you know OT and zenzo are
2:03:05
both heavily counteracted by his Counter Strike um the Gallo uh obviously is tankier so not
2:03:13
doing as much damage especially to a bulky Target and like ruler only really has bur so I feel like as the game goes
2:03:20
on Morgan is going to become more and more problematic and this is one of those games where even in team fights Jax is just going to be so hard to deal
2:03:28
with you know um the I feel like the more Auto attack based your composition is the more powerful this Champion can
2:03:34
be in team fights well Kane is now just going to be able to clear out these minions does take so much damage from
2:03:40
Clos oh my God yeah they keep opting into these Lane assignments where it's the OT into the aier and it's the uh Jax
2:03:49
vers the gallo and I think bro just benefiting from it yeah pretty psyched about it crash down over the wall H have
2:03:56
to be a little bit uh frightened about what Canyon's going to be able to do with his Lulu in tow as we do have some
2:04:02
of the shield there broken arakan has come up yet again surprisingly it's uh it's a voracious one it's kind of crazy
2:04:09
I was expecting that uh have a lot more ruinous uh in uh today's game just
2:04:14
because of the amount of hype and excitement that ji versus bro just bring in general it's funny they've just
2:04:19
released like the new patch on it they're like oh we've adjusted it you should see uh you know a more gracious
2:04:27
Colo and more ruinous and ProPay and I'm like how do they do that like as in more
2:04:32
than zero well ch's going to be able to grab the second turret for ji sorry third
2:04:38
turret for geni as they were able to eradicate them from the mid lane they also grab the outer on the top side an
2:04:44
aan might be considered now as well so four turrets to one bro really losing out as far as structure money is
2:04:49
concerned and you've got their Tower destroyer in the bottom Lane where there isn't an outer turret available yeah the
2:04:55
TP mid uh from the side of gen pushing that wave in I was thinking maybe they're going to make a move towards the
2:05:01
adakan um with four members around the area but they decided you know hold it for now no real inclination to push
2:05:07
towards it yet and it's been a slow game and I think that is where geni really
2:05:13
shine when they can just set the pace and have control h and also I talked a bit about this in draft how their comp
2:05:19
really wants the enemy team to come into them they have a lot of defensive tools lot of heal now they're the team with the goldie with control of the map and
2:05:26
with a lot of towers taken it's very easy for them to get set up and just say to bro hey come at me bro yeah and uh
2:05:33
bro they are bro so it does make sense that they would be asking that uh closer not going to be able to fight Kean this
2:05:39
time around Keen actually completing his second item STX and the black CLE are both done now so certainly very Bruiser
2:05:47
is Mr urot theoretically shouldn't be doing as much as the game goes later in later but that ultimate is always so
2:05:54
incredibly impactful if you can make it work so we'll see whether Keane is going
2:06:00
to be able to do the things that he wants to do on his OT wait what I just find it so funny that you look at OT and
2:06:07
on the scoreboard and it's like he has an eight gold Bounty yeah no these mini bounties are actually hilarious like the
2:06:14
18 gold like 20 gold waa eight go like what we saw yesterday like someone had a
2:06:19
two gold Bounty and then died and it's very very strange Arrow has to be used defensively here from hype and also
2:06:25
takes so much damage just trying to get himself away doesn't have to flash so at least holds on to his Summoners but that
2:06:32
is another big cool down that bro won't have for this potential dragon fight or even the aan fight if that is where
2:06:39
they're going to go as trovy looking for Morgan once again has been holding on to a experienced lead this entire time like
2:06:46
chovy's had the biggest upgrade in play so far yeah it's funny cuz last time he played the Gallo I mean you play Gallo
2:06:53
you don't expect that champion to be farming up a storm and his farm his CS numbers were a little bit lower and now it's just like he's he's downloaded it
2:07:01
he's like I know how to get 10 over 10 CS per minute as Gallo as G he's like Y
2:07:07
is too hard to farm on give me Gallo chovy is chying right now oh yeah uh
2:07:12
absolutely and it has led to them having about a 3,000 gold lead and it just feels like the pressure is constant yeah
2:07:19
and it just looks like like I don't don't feel the options the ways out for bro here and so they have hit Underdog
2:07:27
status well and truly here in this game it is now time for the Bros to find an angle the unfortunate thing is is that
2:07:32
they're just not doing a whole lot of setting up to try and find them outside of maybe this as edge of Knight like you
2:07:38
were talking about now completed for rer so very happy about having access to that one canyon now getting information
2:07:44
here where he can you're going to miss there from hok as I believe geni should be able to
2:07:52
just take this down honestly there's just no vision in this area control Ward goes down you going to miss and arakan I
2:08:00
think still taking damage here as we can see we're going to take the northern entrance let's see what they can actually find here as they've broken the
2:08:06
shield on rer that is definitely valuable Hal of arrows coming down though arakan getting lower and lower
2:08:12
can huk make something happen that's the question as trovy looking to get in position so that he can press that alt button and not get
2:08:19
interrupted okay key just going to disain for what he is let's see how much damage he can actually take here as po
2:08:25
just gets obliterated humbu gets into the back line but I don't know about that one lands another q gets the flash
2:08:31
kick to take down the Urgot and now it's closer's turn to do that damage he rips through them as ring now in the back of
2:08:37
this Baron pit and look at Morgan yeah he might have been adorable there when he was polymor but now he's flashing on
2:08:43
your face and taking you down the hail of arrows might create a bit of space here and without Flash not going to be
2:08:49
able to catch up to rer but that is no arakan for anyone and bro
2:08:55
winning a fight and if you actually look as well at the sumon Spells every single Flash from ji B there it's only a one
2:09:01
kill lead look at how much huk has to do to get in position to kick it takes
2:09:07
forever yeah finds an angle here and I think he was hoping to
2:09:12
kick yeah but unfortunately just ends up killing the a God you know ruler just doesn't have the DPS in these fights as
2:09:19
the Poke Baris health bars get low but can't really just tread through Morgan and Morgan is a demon just charging him
2:09:25
down has to flash away he is such a threat right now I think bro's approach to fight was a really important thing
2:09:31
there cuz that choke was just impossible to cut through they took the wider route po was kind of the sacrifice and hype
2:09:37
the whole time was free hitting Morgan was just unmatched and I think maybe you know we talk about slow and steady being
2:09:44
the pace where geni can really control it but I I feel like with this lethality virus and with that composition if the
2:09:49
game goes late I'm really favoring gen's I mean it's air and Ash right like they
2:09:54
they scale beautifully getting later and later I feel like Ash has that sort of lull where she doesn't feel like she does the DPS but then you give her six
2:10:01
items and she will just destroy you as now bro looking to try and once again do
2:10:07
exactly the same thing but with Morgan on the bottom side of the map destroying in a turrets they spot the fact that Keen is down there to answer him as
2:10:16
troby now moves in Arrow going to connect onto the Gallo here as hype just standing forward
2:10:22
and the Q is going to connect from hok as he moves on in I don't know about this one J it's a little bit scary but they have keen moving up a little bit
2:10:28
earlier teleports available for both of them and they've taken over the utan the
2:10:33
EB and flow of this fight though you can see now Morgan moving in spots the teleport might see that this is the time
2:10:38
magnastorm this time finally working up with the polymorph is gorgeous on Morgan into the back line he's stunned forever
2:10:44
but he's still has access to that Counter Strike and he's still going to be feared Beyond Death
2:10:52
four people with the ultimate and now hyp can you do it can you be the Savior
2:10:57
can you be the her the flash is so good and the blood thst it keeps him alive it's one up on both sides troby versus
2:11:05
hype Bros managed to clutch back a fight where it looked like they had no right to win it closer goes for the shuffle
2:11:11
and manages to land it hype his Pixel Perfect on the clean up he knows chus here yeah can he win the 1 V one I mean
2:11:19
he's looking pretty good and just wants to get away so not wanting to deal with this gallo and let's have a look at the
2:11:25
fight one more time does arakan actually go down I don't think he does no and credit to Juro here interupts The Real
2:11:30
Crash down poly morphs Morgan before he gets in who then gets rooted the peel is great and this is geni doing what that
2:11:36
comp wants to do but theyve been a lot of tools here and Clos it he does get stopped initially by a short turn but my
2:11:44
God yeah on to Five Guys Le is not the pick you expect to be getting in the
2:11:49
mixer and team fighting like a beast at this point of the game is just on point he is so good and then hype is the
2:11:57
benefactor and oh the beneficiary sorry and and I think as well you know hype
2:12:03
went for the blood thirst a second he was getting poed quite heavily at the start of the fight but was healing off minions getting the sustain back up and
2:12:09
I think the value on the item has been massive so far this game oh yeah APO now going to get engaged on here but is able
2:12:15
to just crash down his way out I do like the fact that Duro and Canyon have basically been ATT attached to the hip
2:12:21
throughout this game like that is where they're going to get that Lulu value I guess uh and you've got rer just
2:12:27
clearing waves in the mid lane as hype yeah I don't know whether you're really going to find too much value there is
2:12:33
stuck by the fear Beyond Death you connect there from hok wants to possibly find a bit of an angle here as everyone
2:12:39
fishing for these opportunities non-committal CC available from a lot of different people but hype now without
2:12:46
Flash without cleanse does have Arrow but it is still a little bit of a worrisome time to be the as year I think
2:12:51
geni have now got him well and truly in their sight especially cuz we talked about gen um burning all of their
2:12:58
Summoners uh in that earlier fight all the flash is going to be coming back up and especially when you think about the
2:13:04
fact of like chovi having flash but even ruler having flash if you get caught by one of the SCS height might just die and
2:13:11
then as soon as that happens the hopes in the fight I feel like would be pretty
2:13:16
dire for bro right now but specifically as well because it's been I mean sometimes you have difficult decisions
2:13:22
on where you want to put your focus on the map especially with the introduction of arakan but when it's a chem Tech Dragon yeah no no like and it's top side
2:13:29
atakan both teams are just so locked in on the top side of the map and it's like this dragon is just invisible but the
2:13:37
the real problem here for bro is losing these turrets is never mind hype is just going to find Canyon he's just dead okay
2:13:45
now a big teleport to come forward the emperor divide comes down he's thrown into the blender quite literally but now
2:13:51
H looking for Keen looking for the opportunity and chovy he's gone golden but hype is still at full health can he
2:13:58
get the DPS that's the question is Morgan he Dives in He's Got The Counter Strike again and hok is a monster on
2:14:06
this Lee sin try almost kills all of them but in the end it's an ace for the Bros the value hamack is getting on this
2:14:13
Lee sin in these team fights is absurd and try you know I feel like he's doing
2:14:18
so much on the gallo on camera as well that's fantastic they're like
2:14:25
what this is mad this is a team that beat us and now I mean as well with the
2:14:30
sustain this Trio has that can heal up so I mean this is just flawlessly played the Ulen hype they KCK canion out of the
2:14:36
g w to chovy's old doesn't get any value but then this extended play this choke
2:14:42
is Flawless for chovi and Keen the fear is Big the Ts that come in are big but
2:14:47
the DPS from hype is consistent those lack of sums doesn't cause issue and look at huk now so he's he's over here
2:14:54
gets knocked up go flashes over the wall finds another q he's just playing so well he is just so good honestly and the
2:15:02
thing is as well because it's this tank Gallo if this was like full AP Gallo that we used to have back in the day I
2:15:08
think chovy would have just dominated that fight but he you know he survived for a long time he nearly did but just the damage wasn't quite there we do see
2:15:14
geni pick up the chem Tech Dragon but the baron went over to bro I think J just going to say all right you can have
2:15:21
silly aan thing uh because it just hasn't been a very good time for us going up com in I think they want be
2:15:28
there too much DPS there's so much DPS here three items on closer one of them being a death capap as now Po's trying to move them out of the way the first
2:15:35
Arrow to miss but aan goes down so who cares if the Bros are going to die as
2:15:40
Clos just throws chovy over the wall he tries the heroic entrance and is going to successfully do so but he's still not
2:15:46
in a great position because look at hype he's able to free hit another kick to death here from hok as the Bros have
2:15:54
just taken no prisoners man they're all still alive no one sent back to base just yet and they'll be the ones to
2:16:01
start ripping through these turrets now and they're just playing so well geni want to contest that account want to get
2:16:07
over but they just get locked into a fight where you're against the buff you don't have hopes but like Morgan is a
2:16:12
demon on the backline hype Untouchable and hand back this leas in has been so
2:16:18
crisp yeah this is like the best part about this right is it's not that geni are playing really badly in throwing and
2:16:24
all this stuff bro are just playing insanely well Genji honestly I mean is bro with some of the best lead we've
2:16:30
seen so far K cup H and now looking at end in the game yeah Kee is probably
2:16:35
just dead W growth is kind of fantastic as Canyon gets into that backline but he is going to be destroyed no one can
2:16:42
touch hype right now as he is actually going to be sent back home but there it is bro pick up an unprecedented 20 over
2:16:50
gen G and these huge grins on their faces Edgar comes in to congratulate
2:16:55
everyone we knew they had it in them they've taken down geni before in the last tournament they were in and they do
2:17:02
it here again with a a far more upgraded you could say uh lineup pay your bro
2:17:07
taxes that is a lesson to pay tax be like Leo that's what you have to be in
2:17:13
the I mean what a performance and I I I just think like this is the hype we had
2:17:19
in the Casper Cup and the caveats we knew there were caveats we knew that obviously not every team had their full
2:17:24
roster this is a full strength gen G yes they had to fight for it but it was a 2
2:17:31
a 2 they needed it most and it was like some of the best like huk just displayed
2:17:38
some of the best Le Sim mechanics we've seen since like some vintage Canyon stuff that was being thrown out there
2:17:44
like he was so consistent every single fight they were eating cool Downs when they needed to like Morgan was getting
2:17:50
into that back line eating the polymorph so that the rest of the team could then rotate around and you know what summer
2:17:57
2023 when bro beat gen there were no Stakes they already out playoffs nothing happened this win is so important this
2:18:03
win could be the reason this win ties them with h life Esports I think uh I
2:18:08
mean that they have less losses oh no okay so they're now negative one but they're ahead of dnf yeah but the the main thing is without this win if they
2:18:15
lost to these strong teams I had in their schedule we could have seen them out the tournament and this win has made me so happy because yeah now we get to
2:18:22
see more BR they deserve it they Des be there this is how you fight for it and
2:18:27
of course group Baron still going to have a very uphill battle this moves them towards four versus the nine that
2:18:33
team Elder do have so it's still likely The Chopping Block exists on that side
2:18:38
of the standings and so now it's B and K that are really really upset that jengi
2:18:45
just lost 02 to the Bros yeah I mean I I think think now the
2:18:51
pressure is really on I mean we talked about how group Elder are so far ahead that group Aron it's about fighting for
2:18:57
yourself and bro took that seriously yeah uh and and now it's going to be a scramble to pick up points I I think a
2:19:04
lot of people went in today expecting this to be a swift defeat and uh it wasn't Swift but it was a defeat but not
2:19:09
for the side we expected and it really shakes things up for group Baron and kind of keeps things on the edge and you
2:19:16
know I'm oh let's have a look at some of these highlights I'm just looking for just watch h hamack just got so much
2:19:21
value in every single fight and a fight at this time of the game around the grubs it's expected right you expect Le to do a lot but it's the fact that
2:19:28
despite this composition from geni having so much CC so much PE it's a difficult composition to play Leon into
2:19:34
and he just had no fear like despite constantly getting low HP the Triumph frogs coming in which is getting so much
2:19:40
value and he's like look I know what my job is I know what I have to do I don't care if my health is low I have a job to
2:19:46
do and to be fair the rest of the team as well Morgan was a demon of the backline Clos when he got this massive Shuffle and
2:19:53
hype just felt you know what you know what Max I'm hyped I'm hyped yeah dude
2:19:59
I'm thoroughly hyped and look at him like I reckon KT just like wait why did
2:20:04
we give this guy away like that was real dumb give him back like what's what's the the the the thing on this loan like
2:20:10
can we just cancel it now cuz this guy is real good and The Biggest Loser out
2:20:15
of this is B I think because he wasn't here for this moment occasion and hyp
2:20:21
played exceptionally well my God it's just a good day to be a pro lever is it not look at hug maybe we
2:20:28
just give him P just because of this one game where he was absolutely extraordinary I think every day is a
2:20:34
good day to be a bro lead I mean it's true particular day absolutely the sun
2:20:40
is shining bright I'll tell you that much oh it really is I think is it closer though because closer was just
2:20:46
phenomenal in both of these games I want to give P to everyone it's so hard honestly it is legitimately
2:20:53
such a hard decision on who to give P to and also like how are you going to top
2:20:59
your P comment from yesterday oh yeah true that's going to be a tough one you'll have to think about that one
2:21:04
after we do get off air oh man I'm I'm still just trying to
2:21:09
collect myself still trying to figure out what this means whether it means anything or whether it means the world
2:21:15
it means everything it does to the fans to the Bro tax payers but also I think this team
2:21:21
it looked like the confidence has been shaken in that first couple of games that confidence is back yeah the energy
2:21:26
that we saw at the kesper cup wasn't there but look at these guys they are
2:21:32
over the moon rer does a lot of damage but hyp as well keeping up on a DPS Ash
2:21:37
like when closa was doing as much as he was oh man I mean these damage grafts are actually very very similar and you
2:21:43
saw like this was turning into the classic geni G graph around that 20 minute Mark I think we were looking
2:21:49
forward to game three and then the Bros just went backto back fights and it was all over from there
2:21:55
and I think it's really the aggressive just the only willingness to lose slowly
2:22:01
yeah it's it's such a new thing for bro and just saying look we're waiting for a win really really fing the angle and
2:22:07
yeah I think this makes a lot of sense given what he did in game one oh for sure and then that shuffle on the top
2:22:13
side of the map which was honestly game-winning yeah I mean he made a huge play in game two the game in general wasn't as active that shuffle was
2:22:19
massive but game one he was absolutely monster so I I think I think you would struggle to find someone BR who didn't
2:22:25
deserve it but closer definitely did deserve it he certainly did and I'm just
2:22:30
confused about what the power rankings are going to look like I just know that I did my overreactions uh that we often
2:22:36
like to do we got a bit confused this year didn't know quite when to do them so I just asked everyone to do it a little bit early we'll see whether we
2:22:42
actually use them I'm glad that I don't have bro in last place that's uh that's all I'm saying as orx is typing in make
2:22:49
sure that he knows what the line is what's the line oh I I I won't give it away I won't give it away I'm figuring
2:22:54
out you know all got to get it in got to get it in a lot of pressure you know I feel like we've had this discussion
2:23:00
where like the Korean side really amped up their game when it comes to the P comments so we had to amp up all it's a
2:23:05
bit of a battle and then like the will come like damn that was a com we to step AR it it's just by Theos is there though
2:23:12
he's so good finding those comments is now we're going to throw it over to di for some translation of the closer
2:23:18
interview thank you very much guys this is de for the P interview translation joined by closer on the side of
2:23:26
okay and let's take a look
2:23:32
at thank you you got the first win you desperately fought against gen G how do
2:23:38
you feel you know given how powerful our opponent was we really just came here
2:23:45
telling ourselves let's just do well but I'm just so happy that we were able to win and yeah you put up such an amazing
2:23:52
performance today ji is a relatively Hefty team so how are you able to pull a Flawless two Z I think we had a really
2:23:59
good practice session the night before and I think we just came in with
2:24:06
a good momentum so I think everyone was able to play really well today and we noticed how different OK savings bion's
2:24:13
team fighting is now and based on the head coach Edgar's comment you guys just love to fight way too much and you guys
2:24:21
need to make some adjustments so what was that adjustment
2:24:26
process Improvement is something that we always work on and I think our head coach actually told us
2:24:32
that you know even if you die just go in hard and fight hard and just take them down with you and I think that's what
2:24:38
really
2:24:44
help as the defending champion of were there any changes in the mind of
2:24:52
you know yeah we came in with a really good momentum and High Spirits but we started out with two losses but I don't
2:24:58
think we actually came to that and I think that's what really helped us today and after defeating J you have added one
2:25:06
win to group bar so any message to group bar you know we felt really bad and
2:25:12
sorry for group bar but I hope that this can become a turning point for all of us
2:25:18
and any message over to the bro out there you know I'm sure that you guys
2:25:23
have been worried and concerned but I'm just thankful thank you so much for always supporting us and that's the end
2:25:29
of the interview with closer and back to the space thank
2:25:38
you thank you very much dear welcome back to the space I lost my voice from shouting in the last time uh again one
2:25:45
more time everyone on the side of uh the Bro fans let's remember who's on that
2:25:50
Squad it is Lord Morgan hero hanack Commander closer Head Hunter hype and of
2:25:58
course the president Paulo it is a two victory for the Bros over jeni
2:26:05
welcome back to the space it's time to celebrate the victory here that's right claps in the background yep yep yep it
2:26:11
was a good it was a good series good they played really well and jeni disrespected them like they disrespected
2:26:18
bnk FX last week and you've got to respect the kespa Cup champions right you have to respect a team that is going
2:26:24
to punish that is going to be aggressive that is going to be confident and as a result you know bro are able to take the
2:26:30
W two Z though a result I don't think anyone would have expected and whenever it comes to performances like this we
2:26:37
have to go both ways on one hand I think it's valid to criticize Jen because as you're pointing out if jeni play with
2:26:44
all the respect that I think they should have for an opponent that won C back up something we keep going back to even
2:26:50
with how rough they looked we know that the potential is definitely there but
2:26:55
the fact that not only we see that but we actually get to see Peak hok Peak
2:27:01
hype closer looking like I think he hasn't looked in years uh particularly in that first game absolutely incredible
2:27:08
you'll love to see it I think the humbug vote is completely warranted given the game number two and V and cost that one
2:27:15
I don't get I mean I love Mor they love they love VI I know love Morgan they love the lord it's a little bit of a
2:27:22
bias vote from Vian cast but he he played fine you it was all right he was good he was good especially game two
2:27:28
yeah but I I don't know man I I just love it and we were talking about this I did not believe in bro winning in that
2:27:36
first game because bnk didn't and that was uh that was painful but the fact
2:27:41
that they actually closing out I I love it when a team gets punished for the disrespect and I think
2:27:47
that's what bro did here they're like yes we're uh lower ranked lck team but guess what still cannot disrespect us
2:27:54
exactly you had your comment about Faker I had the disrespect don't disrespect me
2:27:59
bro uh we're bro don't disrespect us and that was kind of the story of this one for me especially with with chovi and
2:28:05
game one really just getting bopped by closer that was the story of of the first half of the series in game two
2:28:11
chovi pulled it back together and Kenyon did not still didn't still was just out
2:28:17
and about yeah we got highlights from that do we have some more yep godfist Lee sin especially in that last game so
2:28:24
many of those fights hanging on whatever hok did so isn't it mostly his foot though that's kind of like the thing
2:28:29
with him where he kicks you know yeah but that's also the skin that's the skin yeah it's not got foot it works I'm just
2:28:35
where he got Fe I always criticize whoever casts and puts a comment all right let's see family of C is the best
2:28:44
because Cloud Templar and closer cuz I know that's my bad I
2:28:51
everyone to when you hear C about Challengers and guess what hype and waight or hype sorry hype and we I was
2:28:57
hype and huk were also amazing cler didn't play in C so I don't know um
2:29:02
strong mid makes a strong team why words uh you would expect him to say that
2:29:07
about top but you know still thinking back to well no in 2022 when he couldn't make playoffs he's still he's not over
2:29:13
it he's like if I had a strong mate I would have made it shocked me as well closer y healing
2:29:20
uh speaking for almost everyone that made predictions uh throughout did you predict again Deon I was saving the wins
2:29:27
for week one of lck when stats count but that's okay this one still counts as well especially for group Baron and L
2:29:34
requires four teammates and one unshakable core I mean that's a real pony going to the well there yeah that's
2:29:39
a real good comment about game two though because his uh azir ult really turned the game around um and save them
2:29:45
in a big way Pony to poet you love to see it definitely all right all right let's get to it highlight time uh this
2:29:53
one also a barn burner a slobber knocker lots of fighting happening this time two
2:29:58
backto back oton fights and in game number one I think Keen had an amazing performance here the Urgot it just
2:30:04
didn't hit the mark unfortunately we saw Dar trying to get on top of hype didn't quite find the damage and then even with
2:30:10
huk not getting the kick onto ruler which I think would have been the dream it still led to the situation where
2:30:16
Morgan could go completely unchecked and theas talks about this this should take over the team fights and he really
2:30:22
really did yeah this fight ends up being a really crazy one and it's closer play that saves today notice this really nice
2:30:28
play Here by Duro denying Paulo's crash down taking him out here first but Morgan's in the backline canyon has the
2:30:34
wild growth obviously but it's hype's positioning that allows him to buy time here and then even while taunted closer
2:30:41
is still able to set up last minute the emperor divide that buys just enough space here for hype who had great
2:30:47
positioning here in the mid to late game there's a big reason why they're able to win I was surprised hype didn't get any votes to be honest cuz his game two
2:30:54
performance his arrows included was pretty phenomenal I think it's because they remember hype to the moon on the
2:30:59
kais that's fair yeah the two plays where I lost my voice included hype he was he was like and that's fair to
2:31:06
deduct some points but I'm with wolf like I I can't believe he got no votes cuz outside of that his game was really
2:31:11
good on K he ended up like what 81 and the one was was funny but it could have
2:31:16
had a little bit you what else is funny is when Canyon kind of did a similar thing but by himself second highlight
2:31:22
where he goes in it this is this is Peak regular season Canyon unfortunately we've seen this before and particularly
2:31:29
on things like zenzo I just I don't I don't understand
2:31:34
what the don't have any Vision look at he has abs no IDE where and he you have
2:31:40
to open that like he had he had the opportunity I know the arrow the the timing window isn't that big but if he
2:31:46
SS there this fight ends up being relatively close they were definitely at the ready there as long as he does
2:31:52
anything flashed Ed I think that geni might be bringing us to a third game but instead bro take over and chovi you know
2:32:01
it's hard to play it's hard to remember like how to play from an even or behind game State and chovi is playing this
2:32:06
game like he's massively ahead obviously decent timing on the zonas there but really just not making the impact he
2:32:12
wants on this gallo and yeah just getting shut down here at the end of this one had a few fights as well in
2:32:18
this game where he Ed back into lost team fights and just donated some gold over he had a great laning phase but was
2:32:24
not his best performance overall in the series and I think this is just again in my opinion jeni disrespecting their
2:32:29
opponents the prep coming into this not as clean as it would be against a stronger team I think we will see jji
2:32:34
back uh back up to to form in their later matches I feel like this says this series says more about bro than it does
2:32:40
about jeni yeah they just they just did not play well right I think that ruler gets a bit of a caveat I think he did
2:32:47
well I think Duro in game number one was a little bit inactive but not really the
2:32:52
issue and then in game number two I think his Lulu performance was good yeah and I I feel like that's why we're given
2:32:58
I guess ging a little bit more of a pass here because you could see the parts kind of firing off at different moments except for Canyon and maybe that one's a
2:33:05
little bit of concern cuz we've seen him have reactions where he would be able to
2:33:10
block something like that Ash Aon zinja again I just I think that we see very
2:33:16
clearly that the core of gen and the reason why team has been so good for so long is chovi specifically right cuz
2:33:22
there's been a lot of changes around him but he has always been there when he is not having his day and some of the early
2:33:28
Gallo play like the the the the punches the wrong way going in when he shouldn't uh that's just not something we're used
2:33:34
to seeing from him and I think that if that happens plus Kyon doesn't play that well geni just kind of falls apart y
2:33:41
well they did in this series as they fell two to zero so let's take a look at those standings which looks a lot better
2:33:46
for group Baron because of it wasn't looking so Ros get themselves on the board plus the
2:33:52
Gap now to five between Baron and Elder they're two wins away from T1 right like
2:33:58
if if T1 drops a game and go 22 and bro wins their next one like there's a world
2:34:03
where bro could actually go towards the the top half of the standings but the most important thing is they've distanced themselves now from bmk so
2:34:09
they're no longer in danger of being eliminated because Baron yeah they got a win today there likely going to be the losing Team all right well a huge huge
2:34:16
Victory here for bro an upset some would call but will there'll be another one we'll find out in just a little bit hanw
2:34:23
life Beast courts and Nong shim red force will do battle for their respective groups in here in the lck cup

2:52:03
[Music] welcome back ladies and gentlemen to the
2:52:09
lck cup or should I say the best day ever there I said it it is it's nothing
2:52:15
could top this unless the noodle boys do something something completely ridiculous we'll just have to see
2:52:22
currently non are actually not doing too bad here in the lck cup they're relatively decent uh win rate things
2:52:28
like this H life Esports desperately wanting to do their bit for team Baron though because team Elder certainly
2:52:33
coming out on top even though Brewer were able to pull back that one win that's only 4 to n it's still not
2:52:40
looking too hot yeah it's not at a point where it's like mathematically impossible but I feel like that takes a
2:52:45
long way to go away and it's at the point it becomes reasonably unlikely it's definitely approaching if not
2:52:52
already at that point um but winds are still important even if we get to the point where it's locked in the group Elder ahead wins are still important for
2:52:58
individuals in terms of seeding and as we've said before the fifth place team in the losing group will get knocked out
2:53:04
completely so every match is going to count uh for the whole length of this period and now bro well and truly out of
2:53:11
the that uh elimination position as we can see here in the standings 1 and two minus one after their uh last match of
2:53:18
uh sorry their first match of this week and dnf one and two themselves but they don't have the game score after that
2:53:24
unprecedented uh two Z so completely ridiculous it's now B and K that are on the chopping block and we'll see whether
2:53:30
they can pick up a win finally for group Baron in their future matches but now we
2:53:36
have to focus on H life Esports versus nongshim H life Esports were of course the team doing the initial uh picking
2:53:43
here as they were the uh lck Champs they're wanting to really find some a
2:53:48
string of wins to go together because their first match against geni wasn't exactly what they wanted coming out of
2:53:54
the gate they prefer a you know repeat situation from what happened in that lck final wasn't to be the case we'll see
2:54:01
whether they're back on the horse now their last match was definitely impressive yeah definitely impressive one there where I feel like we sort of
2:54:07
saw them come together more so but I also think Nong shim we've seen some additions to this roster King and in
2:54:12
particular his Rumble performance was disgusting the damage like we all know
2:54:18
Rumble can do a lot of damage but we don't always see Rumble do a lot of damage that was a rumble who just took over the game and particularly this is a
2:54:24
matchup we' obviously we all remember the 2022 World Finals but we've seen this one many times before and it often delivers it does and kingan can be so up
2:54:33
and down right either he's an absolute God or he just feels a little bit invisible on the rift when he's up
2:54:39
against Z he just tends to find a little bit of extra or at least that was the case a couple of years ago if we were to
2:54:44
remember a certain world final so we'll see what does happen here is uh operation stop Viper is going to be in
2:54:50
effect um he has been pretty good uh especially in the matchup against KT roller as we can see here yeah and I
2:54:57
think hle obviously demolished KT and we've talked about how they struggled against JG but I think like the fact
2:55:04
that they were our summer Champions and then picked up Z which everyone has seen
2:55:09
as being like a big upgrade y um that that lineup is so strong that it really
2:55:15
feels like they should be on top it really feels like they should be demolishing every opponent they go against so you know when we see teams
2:55:21
make them bleed is going to be interesting and I think Nong shim have shown so far they are capable of challenging but still I think H are the
2:55:28
overdogs right now I think they are now we've been talking about overdogs a lot today I want to keep that up I'm
2:55:33
actually really enjoying it as you can see that is a very powerful Raccoon as
2:55:39
we saw there um impressive stuff nction fans definitely like a different breed
2:55:46
and I'm really excited about he was in fact holding an orange to represent H Sports there as well just showing how much control they have over their
2:55:53
opposition but now as they make their way out into Lark we'll see whether the players can do just as well as some of
2:55:59
the fans because yeah Nong shim just follow them on uh on X or Twitter or whatever you want to call it uh they are
2:56:04
it it's so good it's so good constant bangers what funny with the holding the orange cuz it feels like an apple like crushing an apple in your hand is like
2:56:10
so hard but an orange they probably could just yeah it' be quite quite easy depending on how ripe the Orange is get covered in the orange juice you would it
2:56:17
would you make a mess in fact don't do that if you're here in l park now it could also spray some of that Citrus
2:56:22
juice in your eye and that would really hurt it's quite acidic you know it's not maybe as bad as a lemon but still it
2:56:27
would send a message it would send a message yeah your commitment would be shown but on now we're encouraging them
2:56:33
though put some goggles on yeah please Safety First when you're when you're
2:56:38
crushing oranges in your bare hands as a raccoon please goggles why would a raccoon have bare
2:56:45
hands well I mean they they were drawing it could have whichever hands they want probably would be more effective you
2:56:51
know as far as Crush raccoon hands are very small I don't think you know you think about like palming a basketball
2:56:57
like you need AIG hand you need a tangerine if you yeah that makes all right um let's get back on track here as
2:57:03
we got H life ESP Sports looking to take on nongshim in our second match of the day we're a little bit giddy we're a
2:57:08
little bit maybe um unhinged maybe because we had the greatest uh game of
2:57:13
all time prior to this and to top it I don't know what they're going to do I'm looking forward to to it though because
2:57:20
there are some really fun uh crossovers between these two squads especially on
2:57:25
the top and bottom sides of the list right you've got Z versus kingan of course pretty historical one from 2022
2:57:31
and uh you've got Delight versus lence it's a battle of the former gen supports yep I I love how it just kind of
2:57:37
alternating between the two organizations now they're both clear gen they're both on different orgs but uh you know definitely still a bit of
2:57:42
rivalry there between them uh many times have these two uh been looked at as
2:57:48
supports and both of them have won all pro four so lot of rest on them really
2:57:54
to make an impact as well uh I feel like we've seen picks come out which we don't
2:57:59
TP you know we've often times have like a fixed meta with supports where it's like oh it's engaged meta or oh it's more Enchanted meta but like especially
2:58:04
with failers I feel like we've seen players able to flex a bit more and particularly I think lens is someone
2:58:10
who's been known to bring out the the zany stuff we've seen barrel with like the pantheon support I would be down for
2:58:15
lens to Branch out a little bit I reckon uh we could see his EL support again that would be a little bit of fun that's
2:58:21
uh that's definitely a good one we'll see whether we can rival Barrel's nine deaths on the champion it's tough to
2:58:27
rival Barrel it is I mean just in any uh way shape or form but uh there's Dandy
2:58:32
Looking ready as chel also just trying to go through the notes figure out exactly what is happening here for Nong
2:58:40
shim and I like the rice smile maybe that means there is something that has been cooked up over at nongshim not just
2:58:48
delicious Raman and other product I'm imagining on the top of his page is written in capital letters b well in
2:58:54
cran band scarner and cired and underlined yeah and there's around it
2:59:00
yeah yeah and then there's a few Doodles like pictures of kingan or something like that speaking of kingan his Rumble
2:59:06
uh is going yeah oh and yeah looks like they've nailed the feier strategy all right and now we're going to see a big
2:59:11
pause because we don't know what to do from here all of our notes have been concluded uh and it's sorted out and
2:59:18
wait it is a big for it's hilarious uh kalistus does still need to be looked at though and it's a bit more of a flexible
2:59:24
ban I guess at the end unless the varus is banned in which case you have to ban Ash right something like that typically yeah uh I mean it's a little bit danger
2:59:30
to give it open we often seen the varus and Ash banned in tandem but uh you know
2:59:36
I'm not sure specifically I mean maybe there's something that you're concerned about like the uh VI but we've seen VI
2:59:42
not be as on form recently and it looks like it's going to go the Ashante is going to come through also pick we see B
2:59:48
a lot and picked a lot early on uh I could see kingan picking a carry into it but doesn't necessarily need to pick it
2:59:54
right now but I think kingan has been really popping off when he's on these carry picks so you know if he's feeling confident just stand Bessa just go oh
3:00:01
yeah lock it in straight away well we'll look towards the vi it
3:00:07
kind of feels like that thing especially in the face game when you know we have feers but you have the picks that get banned and then you have the picks that
3:00:13
often get banned but then when they don't they just immediately get snapped up uh that's kind of what we're see
3:00:19
by certainly one of those and we'll see what Gideon decides to go for Aurora up and available
3:00:25
certainly has been pretty powerful and uh if you are watching
3:00:30
closer then yeah um she is absurd yeah a lot of potential with a champion uh technically a flex although often seeing
3:00:37
it mid at the moment yeah and when we do see a top it's not as impactful as it used to be last year mean in theory you
3:00:44
could play it bot but that um going to come through from peanut which
3:00:51
if you remember uh last year in summer I had like an insane win streak on this
3:00:57
champion and Z got the Yoni that's actually something you know what I'm going to say it I missed cuz typically we've just seen Yoni p aband and hle
3:01:03
because they have two great y players yeah uh and one of them's got it yeah and um we saw this in our last uh series
3:01:11
we'll see whether uh fer can do another closer performance as that emba we were
3:01:17
talking about is going to be locked in for kinging so we're going to have some Brawlers on the map here to start this
3:01:23
one off I'm actually really liking it as far as just making sure we see a lot of fights and things like this not a whole
3:01:29
lot of range being put into this one outside of I guess the Aurora a lot of dive I think if I was n shame I'd be
3:01:34
looking at picks like Ezreal like z um they take the Ezreal out I think the Z
3:01:39
makes sense as well I mean I know we've talked about Z some sometimes has shortcomings when you have like multiple
3:01:45
layer engages so you can obviously you can't Al all them but into a VI in particular I think it'd be safer just to
3:01:52
take it out of the way especially like a defensive peel back comp with a maokai as well very strong I would agree I
3:01:58
think uh Viper's probably looking for something like a zigs or a Kaiser as well the Ezreal I I do really like that
3:02:05
one is getting rid of some of these more comfortable options and with Malai he does do some magic damage y mix damage
3:02:12
blah blah blah all those arguments but still think that like zig's Kaiser is so strong in this in yeah Viper I mean
3:02:19
Kaiser works so well cuz the flexibility and sort of damage profile but also you know you can build Zas for free um and
3:02:25
not really have to worry about it uh oh wait J can just pick Kaiser himself yeah
3:02:31
he could um could end up seeing you know we've talked a lot about kais and the matchup could end up being that match up
3:02:37
here especially as you have Delight who obviously loves raan true jings going to get taken away um eliminating some of
3:02:44
that range uh long range potential in the team fight reset that's one thing like the immediate impact of the team
3:02:50
fights from longam is is very much known we can see that right now but momentum in these fights can be a big blocker
3:02:57
when you have these tank this tanky front line and they do go for the Kaiser as you said and it looks like it is
3:03:02
going to be the Z in return and it wouldn't surpris me he just zyan yeah I think if you've got Delight
3:03:07
you may as well put him on one of his best Champions they've already banned away the Leona which can have a decent matchup into it but also I imagine the
3:03:13
Leona was just banned because lens really loves the champion so Viper is still hovering it though see whether
3:03:20
they do move to something else I was just hoping for some reason for him to pick cmore just would have been fun uh
3:03:26
don't know why just did would have been neat yeah it would have been neat you know how this just like sometimes you just get that Vibe where like oh I just
3:03:32
want this Champion here and VI would play it anyway uh Delight still just trying to find the raan button uh
3:03:37
instead finds the poppy one and he going to be a to lock that one in steadfast presence can be very frustrating uh for
3:03:44
Aisa so you can understand it yeah good to VI as well uh decent a midgame naus
3:03:49
and just very tanky early on especially compared to the naus so I feel like h a lot of defensive Tools in their
3:03:55
composition uh to kind of protect Viper he did go deathless in their last series you have Zea on y you have peut on maai
3:04:03
uh I think they got a lot of power a lot of comfort but did peanut lose on Malai towards the end of last year or has he
3:04:09
just remained undefeated for like forever he did in playoffs ah I'm pretty sure there was cuz I think it did happen
3:04:16
in playoffs they got left open they lost but obviously they won the whole of playoffs so I think with know yeah yeah
3:04:21
I think you make that sacrifice but it's a fun stat if he's still just that many games in a row without a loss would be
3:04:27
kind of insane yeah I mean this very much seems like one team has a lot of Peel tools lot defensive tools the other
3:04:32
team is just Dive Dive Dive kill kill kill um so it going to be fun to see them interact uh I think I do think that
3:04:40
H GS some good tools to mitigate it kind of feels like playing VI into maokai
3:04:45
poppy does not sound at all and neither wow look at those
3:04:51
oranges that's amazing they're the ones that are about to get crushed by a racon right with his bare hand with his bare
3:04:58
hand yeah as opposed to his normal raccoon hand yeah straight into the the
3:05:03
poor um unless they can escape it and utilizing a draft like this I think they
3:05:08
should be able to avoid the the be Crush um we'll just see uh because Nim have
3:05:15
also got themselves a fair bit of power that's Midland as well which is kind of fun is it let's jump on the
3:05:33
rift all right here we go ladies and gentlemen and honestly if it is the ambessa mid it is then I like it a whole
3:05:40
lot more you mentioned you know that Aurora can be flexed we haven't seen it find as much success on the top side
3:05:45
into a Cante I imagine that you're kind of feeling okay about it yeah it's interesting you know we have seen Fisher
3:05:51
play even the nefi before in the mid Lanes so definitely not unfamiliar to like these 80 mids but we kind of just
3:05:57
had a textbook demonstration of how Aurora can dominate y mid lane by closer
3:06:04
so it's more just saving the ambessa match up maybe the match hang on yeah that's and the thing is as
3:06:10
well I don't know I mean one thing I'll say for sure is that if a swap ends up happening Cante is going to be in a much
3:06:16
more chill position [Music] they are going to spot uh the bot Lane
3:06:23
go top and I want to see what they're going to do about it well right now kingan is just going to move towards Z
3:06:29
in this mid lane say hi to his former teammate you still got the DX Jersey man how you feeling right now Zer is not too
3:06:36
psych cuz he wasn't expecting a uh you know 1 V2 yeah just happy with a swap
3:06:45
situation well they're going to give up the entire range of Mele minions just to try and get Z out of the oh okay we get
3:06:52
you'll take a flash for yeah that was very limit testing from both players you know the W he's like come on hook me and
3:06:58
then lens didn't and he knows that lens goes for those he goes for another one uh as you is going to try and get some
3:07:04
Autos in so the lower Health ASAS makes him a real threat to be Dove but lens I
3:07:09
mean lens is healing up the potions but also if he gets low that's a threat kingan has just decided I'm going to be
3:07:14
annoying yeah and it's working out uh peanut does spot him there now this was interesting to see how they would
3:07:20
navigate uh the you know leaving the Aurora alone under Tower wasn't going to
3:07:26
be ideal so like let's just go back to the old school triple Lane yeah uh and
3:07:32
without as much protection on the top side can make things a little bit bothersome as Delight is just being annoying here takes a buckler to the
3:07:39
Noggin is okay let's see whether Zas can survive this one the flash out from lens
3:07:44
and the fully charged up turret is a bit dangerous but it should get a little bit less excited and there it is first Blood
3:07:51
going over to J and meanwhile on the other side of the map uh or in the middle of the map there is a uh dead
3:07:57
ambessa so immediate First Blood going over to n shim but the answer is Swift
3:08:02
yeah and Z just going to TP back in so he doesn't miss too much from this and if you actually look at how the farm has
3:08:08
played out Viper is really far ahead in Tim CS compared to G even with the kill the gold is about even um between them
3:08:16
so overall I think the that Nim had makes sense but you know because P got that gank off uh it's kind of actually
3:08:22
ended up with them being slightly favored Nim does have the Fe of strength though so I guess yeah there's that there is that it was a full wave I think
3:08:30
that we're seeing just get eliminated towards that top side so that is a large reason why Viper is so far ahead no
3:08:36
teleport available for this guy so let's have a look at this from fer again as all right peut just flashed on top of
3:08:41
him got the Bramble Smash and Ze was able to finish it off yeah not really much to be done yeah
3:08:47
sometimes you miss a que and that kills him that is kind of precisely what it looked like here on the bottom side of the map Z he gets through the first
3:08:54
Salvo but unfortunately there was another one prepared yeah I mean they get the damage down they're very patient
3:09:00
with the timing uh especially when you have two range damage deal as it makes sense but you see how low the tower damage is on King and on on the redive
3:09:07
cuz they it's Longer Now the the cool down time but they waited the full amount uh so really well played from
3:09:13
long definitely been practicing those Dives since uh the new season and they're able to make that one pretty
3:09:19
Swift now top side y h will always go for that one as
3:09:24
Delight uses his toos presence but isn't actually going to be able to win out on the trade just yet Viper and J trading
3:09:30
blows just a little bit there and hens will have that hook back on cool down back off cool down and he will be uh
3:09:35
using it again yeah there's definitely some match ups where the poppy just completely shuts down these engag Champions but nus is one where like even
3:09:43
if you block you know the dash he gets from his Q he can still just like Auto you uh it's not as favorable as some of
3:09:49
the others Y and Zea doing the thing where you you normally press Unbound
3:09:54
Soul first but he just does it without pressing the Unbound Soul button and just uh walks Fisher out of the lane
3:10:00
yeah the early triple dagger is very annoying to deal with yeah he has so much value from attack speed on I mean
3:10:06
both yaso and yon but yeah I mean not sure 100% what the thought
3:10:12
process was on the swap between uh ambessa and Aurora I mean obviously King
3:10:17
have having a great time in this match up right now but it definitely feels like Fisher is struggling a little bit
3:10:22
might just be that uh kingan is the better Aurora player or fer is the better Anda player true could be
3:10:29
something like that comfort for the players yeah it could also be the like look you know I'll still I'm a best I'll
3:10:35
still be useful just dumpster Zas please all right now doing okay is kinging in
3:10:41
the match up not iead by that much to be perfectly honest just a wave but I think there is a wave heading towards in his
3:10:47
teleport up and available hasn't actually been back yet uh so it does need to spend some of that
3:10:54
money as now you got Nong shim considering some grubs cuz they do spawn right now SE might make that a little
3:11:00
bit more difficult here as he unbinds the soul in a kind of awkward spot but peanut happy Christmas going to be
3:11:06
moving over towards these grubs now to see whether they can deny that feat of strength as J going to get smashed into
3:11:12
the wall actually taking a lot of damage ignite coming down no steadfast steadfast presence was available The
3:11:17
Flash in and Delight is just going to solo kill him basically I think that was like one or two Autos from Viper and otherwise it was all the poppy yeah
3:11:24
pretty rough and honestly G unfortunately uses both his thumbs theight really doesn't care about flashing he has hex flash you know he
3:11:29
just unlocked it yeah he actually it's Poppy as well like the ultimate hex slasher yeah g were just in a poor
3:11:35
position there and Gideon gets two uh grubs and gets out so he's kind of okay with that situation but uh yeah it feels
3:11:42
like they kind of caught sleeping By the Light there on this box yeah straight up so it was a very weird kill cuz it just
3:11:48
was like Delight found a heroic charge and then they were like oh but it's just poppy he'll be fine wasn't fine
3:11:55
actually kind of died 20 CS lead between the 80 carries
3:12:00
um which is a large amount this ear and it's it's fortunate that Nim got that
3:12:06
first kill on theu cuz if they didn't this would be even more dire well peanut is you know you were
3:12:13
saying even more dire I think this fits the category as the Nature's grasp comes through oh Unfortunately they both get
3:12:20
caught it's pick your poison as far as who you want to take down but Delight is dead as the turret is going to take him
3:12:26
out and now peanut is going to get revenge but the turret is also getting revenge and so I guess you welcome back
3:12:34
to the game uh my friend some extra money being thrown in there if they were able to do that cleanly and grab both of
3:12:39
those kills then perhaps it was just going to be game over just a massive fumble like the fact that peut has level six and J has no summon spells and even
3:12:47
J made the mistake of getting caught by the ultimate like this should have been an easy dive for hle let's kind of have
3:12:54
a look at what went wrong so G obviously takes the route that's not ideal VI has Agro first and then Delight reg grabs
3:13:01
aggro here oh no does he Buckle a d at the end even justed him and then here
3:13:06
you know P was definitely planning to W to drop aggro the thing is VIP had old so you could kind of do that at any time
3:13:13
they just waited too long that is just honestly both the light and peanut making large characteristic arrows that
3:13:18
have slingshotted j back in the game yeah and yeah you can still see that Viper is ahead by like 500 or so gold
3:13:25
but that doesn't matter you just got like three kills so welcome back glad you can play the game we got 80 carries
3:13:32
that are kind of even now if they' play the dive correctly it'd be over a th000 gold lead and the game might just be
3:13:37
done um so you know and an extra chance being given here and I'm do definitely a player who
3:13:44
want to make the most of it now they are looking for kingan but he does have just absurd amount of wave clear um so very
3:13:49
hard to do much with it the hens is toying with the idea of diving a Cante I think he's just about to dive I think
3:13:56
that's um that's leen's way I think that that is his permanent state of being just wanting to get a minion wave in
3:14:02
here as Gideon going to move on over does see that Ward so Z with full information peanut nowhere in the
3:14:08
vicinity think they're going to look for it Vault breaker to come through as king throws down the ulti just to try and
3:14:14
clear out some minions but uh Gideon uh just going to die um kingan also going
3:14:19
to die on the other side as we can see here and Za says what the heck are you doing bro yeah so I I guess Nim just not
3:14:27
prepared for the fact that Kasam taken CCU for like 17 seconds and is really tanky and canate all of your CC yeah new
3:14:34
information um that they've just learned if someone could get that showmaker copy faster in the chat that would be great
3:14:41
for I think really needed this is kind of the thing as well where like when you are playing in a soft situation I know
3:14:46
it's like a lot after the initial swap but when you're weak sided it's very difficult to kind of do anything in here
3:14:52
yeah blocks the CC for the Q Zip Zap zip dead um you know I also think Z didn't
3:14:57
even look that difficult yeah I mean last last year even at WS a lot Z just doing a fantastic job of playing Dives
3:15:03
against multiple people but here King unfortunately uses all of his tools before anyone takes aggro and then P
3:15:10
just tanks a couple of tower shots and goes there there you go Viper yeah and so Viper is going to even out the kill
3:15:16
score between the 280 carries he hasn't died himself though and an Essence reever has been
3:15:21
completed it's going to be a pretty scary Z moving into the mid game yeah is now a up yes he's now finally got there
3:15:30
some grubbies being considered here by Nong shim as well as Pina going to move on over does find the Nature's grassp
3:15:35
but the public execution into that backline PE up pretty tanky though and now Viper is there to deliver the damage
3:15:40
lens going down lower and lower and fer is basically out of the fight the double knock up from Zer as he Dives forward
3:15:46
it's going to find another one actually giving a double kill over to Viper who's on five remember this guy hasn't died
3:15:52
All Season well actually no since his first match up against gen G but since their
3:15:58
last match up he hasn't died we forget about that first season we forget about that one yeah the first game was not one
3:16:03
that H life Esports fans want to remember and we're going to continue keeping it that way to make them feel better about it you know what I feel
3:16:09
like this is a game of learning we learned D Cante bad idea and I learned
3:16:15
that H life Esports had a match before the KT yes and uh we also learn
3:16:20
Z somewhat good at y oh really yeah new
3:16:25
information that we have just really cool um yeah so that that is a problem
3:16:31
it looks like the ambessa didn't manage to shut them down really in Lane um peanut in the hands just having some fun
3:16:37
of course former teammates as we know um Viper up here just in the face of two people hitting the turret and
3:16:44
they know the Peanut's there delight's going to move over they're going to kill the turret Hook is going to connect onto the light and he cares about as little
3:16:51
as possible just throws his shield into that thing and then moves away yeah this game is starting to feel
3:16:57
really problematic for nongin um 4,000 gold deficit right now and half of that
3:17:04
is between the 80 carries and you know 2.2k it was let's just amp it up there
3:17:11
exclaiming about the 1K like I feel two and a half minutes ago there's an extra cor of gold right there yeah the replay
3:17:17
they focus a lot on the maai not the optimal target ult comes through which knocks away the Aurora H and then we see
3:17:24
Delight Sten so already nin massively on the back but bear in mind this is a 4v5 oh and that was a triple knockup uh
3:17:31
he did get Fisher as well so yeah uh so I mean z just doing everything but this is also a 4v5 from
3:17:39
H and it didn't look particularly close yeah well peanut has two belts to hold
3:17:47
up his very heavy pants and uh Zea is going to move on over and stop kingan from taking down this turret we're
3:17:54
having a look at the Feats of Strength uh okay we're not going to do that because we've got some tinsel on some
3:17:59
brambles getting a flash from King flash as well needed even the ult not enough to get out so I mean I think P's pretty
3:18:05
happy with the value got from the AL there absolutely loses the minion wave yeah takes a tower hit just you know may
3:18:12
as well he can take it indeed uh he's going to delay his Infinity Edge by one item which I think
3:18:18
is kind of fine I like you eventually need the attack speed a lot of the time you do see the infinity edge com in
3:18:23
second after the essence Reaver but I kind of like this and Bens moving on up will be able
3:18:29
to hold this wave uh before D does make it over here so Gideon starting off this Dragon will be the first objective to be
3:18:36
fully taken as of course we've got three uh grubs a piece but it wasn't all in the same set of grubs and Gideon is
3:18:43
going to be able to secure this so first dragon going over to Nim [Music]
3:18:49
all right there's a positive for Nim yeah they got a dragon um just only look at that part of the scoreboard and
3:18:55
you'll be feeling absolutely safe well the thing is you know yes there's a big gold lead but if
3:19:02
you just kind of cover over all of hle it's like oh they got Fierce blood they have some gold they got some grubs you
3:19:07
know yeah it's just relatively rough I feel like that's one thing on the scoreboard we have this new thing that
3:19:13
shows the goal difference between different roles I I don't think it's helping with this positive mindset no I
3:19:18
don't think so either because it means that like cuz it used to be that the top side of the screen was where all the bad stuff was happening and the bottom side
3:19:24
you can just ignore the other side and it's fine as that teleport was actually hilarious as uh okay Ze gone hyper
3:19:31
aggressive and there's Delight again gu able to get himself out of the way but it's not good enough and what the heck
3:19:37
this puppy is still going decides he doesn't even need to press his uh keep his verdict button um because the damage
3:19:43
had already been done yeah uh G will not having to time you know got those extra kills earlier on and that was kind of
3:19:50
the highlight of the game right now and it just feels like H are kind of bullying them yeah um the fact that like
3:19:57
you've got a 21 and five poppy who is able to just run in with impunity and
3:20:04
not die yeah who also went zekes just cuz like I am the carry you know you look on the other side of the hens it's
3:20:10
like oh I'm going to Shield my carry the light is like no that's not how I play the game no it's Z
3:20:17
Z is unbinding the soul looking for an option here let's see whose ultimate going to work out as gets the
3:20:22
knockup actually have it with that um play of the r King done so the Y is
3:20:29
very frightening if he wasn't enough already it's going to be out of turret secured by hle peanut thought that he
3:20:35
was needed but he was actually kind of not as he's going to pull out these Raptors continue about his merry way as
3:20:43
we check out the replay of Zea just just see what was up as doesn't find the
3:20:48
target but he had the Q charge I like how we get a drive by TP as this happens um but yeah ignite just the thing and
3:20:56
like there was the locket there was the ulti didn't matter this didn't last long
3:21:01
enough dead you're going down absolutely that's apparently what it means well Gideon looking for an
3:21:09
opportunity here I think Zea smells something in the water and it might just be that this
3:21:14
turret is given up although Z can unb the soul look clear out the wave and it's going to be a tough one is
3:21:21
okay there's season assist as the public execution comes through the flash out from Ze let's see whether no he's not
3:21:26
going to stay alive that is just a lot of commitment and a lot of damage as H looking to answer on the other side yeah
3:21:32
a little bit over confident his Oak came up literally 2 seconds after he died so
3:21:37
if he had that maybe he could have gotten away but yeah the flash vile is really gide and saying I've had enough
3:21:44
I'm sick of your shenanigans uh and they will be able to get a tower and an objective Bounty out of this positives y
3:21:51
there is that that is they did lose an inner turret on the top side of the map so maybe that goes against the positives
3:21:58
but you don't need to look at that you just look at this and this is pretty good for nun yeah um I mean it was a
3:22:05
nice buffer but then the followup from the um best gives you struggle and I think you know if you had ult you get a
3:22:10
flash Al you can see at the bot me screen it just comes up at the end of that replay um so not going to be an
3:22:15
option playing with with fire a bit too much there and oh God okay so now he's got his quick blades and his Infinity
3:22:22
Edge is almost done just needs a cloak and a recipe compettion you can tell the game's turning around cuz Gideon
3:22:27
actually has a 26 gold Bounty um we'll see when the scoreboard oh oh man that
3:22:33
that's actually that that's insane that's how you know Gideon's in control of the game that's like a whole minion
3:22:38
oh it's up to 30 wa 33 34 we're approaching Cannon territory I'm
3:22:45
investing in Gideon oh yeah he's he's that's that's Gideon to the Moon racking up the Bounty right
3:22:51
now um in the meantime Viper is 29,000 gold ahead yeah that's a lot um yeah
3:22:58
that's like a full item um and we can see that it is almost a full item that he has completed I feel like it's so woo
3:23:06
those drive by Tel that's so fun I feel like it's uh oh peanut peanut is
3:23:12
fighting the rest of the team not fighting as well hi Shell welcome um
3:23:17
didn't see there but she is going to be able to help take down that inner turret and another one is going down on the
3:23:22
bottom side of the map as peanut could be no is he is he going to be in trouble
3:23:28
that's the question is Viper going to come on over there's the flash out CE assist will kill him but Gideon's going to go down as well and now the fight is
3:23:34
really broken out and Nim want nothing more of this but the Flash Forward comes in and Z says no no no no no we are
3:23:41
fighting the all out comes in trades for the Killer Instinct as J is going to be able to try and do something something
3:23:46
here flashes oh the void SE was almost enough but another heroic charge is
3:23:51
going to be the end of him as public execution and somehow Z is still alive
3:23:57
oh get that it needs to be back in the chat again I know that we called for it before and it filled up the chat but it
3:24:02
has to come back again this Cante is doing some Cante things he's just I mean the fact he flashes in doesn't hit the
3:24:08
knockup and then he just stays in keeps going further and further I think you know what I think watching this replay
3:24:15
cuz I mean panut tank right but Pina dies I think we should go into it and think at what point should a
3:24:21
normal Champion die um so I mean this is fine he's healthy he's healthy you know
3:24:27
he goes in oh misses flash unfortunate okay a little bit aggressive they're both hitting him uh you know perhaps now I think he
3:24:36
should have died there yeah but then wait ah Perhaps Perhaps now yeah perhaps
3:24:41
now no oh God Fisher couldn't do like he couldn't do any of his buttons because Z
3:24:47
had another knock back oh God okay well thanks Cante for
3:24:53
existing in the game understandable as to why it was first picked uh throughout the day to be perfectly honest it was in
3:24:58
our previous series also won that one in the hands of Morgan it looks like Z is going to follow suit as far as the
3:25:04
victories are concerned because this game is sitting a little bit closer to a 7,000 gold lead then a six and ich Le
3:25:12
just one objective away from putting their feet on as well just the long flank this is a very long flank he's
3:25:20
just waiting he's like guys I'm here I'm ready I'm going to um get two shot by Viper who has no
3:25:28
no no no no no no give him more credit he's going to oh he can get that blood pedal yes you can get that blood pedal
3:25:34
that's that's oh the oh God wait maybe maybe it's working it's a TP over the
3:25:40
wall from kingan lens he's turned up I mean Gideon's already dead they dive in on top of Viper a bunch of buttons of
3:25:47
press but he has the sto it and he stole it King and picks it up and they managed
3:25:52
to take down Viper there as well the damass oh God they're getting Mega cassant but the Y is dead and the Cante
3:26:00
does finally actually die and they don't really die themselves so the keep his
3:26:05
verdict I think they going to keep themselves alive but man Nong shim the noodles making their way back into the
3:26:10
fight this is the difference between us and the hens cuz we were talking about the blood pedals right he saw that coming oh right he this was the strategy
3:26:17
from the start but it's actually a good flank that comes in if we look at how lens plays it he old flashes on viper
3:26:22
for the immediate knock up the followup comes in from the ambessa and even though Viper does eventually get his ult
3:26:28
off he's so low and I mean the I don't even yeah that it just shouldn't happen
3:26:33
that shouldn't happen but the rest that happens is good team fighting from nongin but it's clear that H lay like guys they have the V we should get out Z
3:26:40
is all runs out I think that's a reason why he didn't keep ganing but uh but
3:26:45
also like I mean they should have got that the um Aran and then everything is so much better
3:26:52
everything is so much but they peut just sometimes decides that a Smite is just
3:26:57
not worth hitting uh he'd rather kill the Champions and that is precisely what they're going to look to do now as
3:27:03
ramble smash pushes land onto the turret he is going to go back home they're going to get some money for that one as
3:27:08
they send a couple back in fact yeah um so one thing we've talked about a fair amount with the varous atakan is that
3:27:14
when you have it you can kind of just run it down and not be punished that hard but the problem is that is a very
3:27:20
different statement from you should run it down okay there's two two different
3:27:26
things if you you can get away with it that doesn't mean that the best you of your above is just charge into the tower
3:27:32
against marai poy and die I want okay King throws down the Alti there's a public execution as they get underneath
3:27:39
the turret that's another cease and assist and Viper is on the floor once again Z is also dead as Delight the next
3:27:45
one on the shopping block as Fisher yeah he's just going to be head sent home the ulti comes forward from zob but doesn't
3:27:52
find the target which was Gideon he's going to jump onto jiu though and he is going to be sent home as L comes back he
3:28:00
really dies if he does go down the anchor is going to be avoided and Nong
3:28:05
shim have brought this game back to within 2,000 gold I mean they've gotten so much value out of this you know
3:28:10
excusing that when Gideon hens went at the tower and just died the gank after that the play after that sorry killing Viper without the
3:28:16
and fer who had a very underwhelming and best game so far he hit the ult on viper
3:28:22
at uh adakan and he hit the AL there was on point with it that's all he needed
3:28:27
and actually I mean I'm not sure the overlay is showing him as having in the old but
3:28:33
I assume he didn't I assume that B I mean he would have CED it but either way Viper goes down it's hard to really
3:28:38
trade in this situation you've lost ID carry who's very fed and when you kill them they just don't even really die
3:28:44
they do a good job they looking for J after but looks like we're going back to live now it's a dragon of peace and
3:28:49
you've kept the gold the gold is now close it's a dragon of pece the game is playable again
3:28:55
somehow yeah and if Viper continues to just keep dying uh to Nim having all of
3:29:02
this targeted CC that is basically unanswerable if lens is going to like ult flash him like you if you get ult
3:29:09
flash it and then uh Al flashed and then uh public execution and then everything
3:29:15
else in the kitchen saying cuz Peanut's going to get engaged on one more time um getting confirmation that Viper did
3:29:20
actually have the ultimate and just didn't manage to press it oh W Viper did
3:29:26
have old so that's just a uncharacteristic misplay for the player who didn't die in the last series
3:29:31
against KT uh just didn't press his there got CAU off guard so Nim though they're now actually doing damage I
3:29:37
think there's a significant change to Pina at least I'm not sure how much they're going to do to when he presses all but uh well he uh did lose half of
3:29:44
his health bar and remember remember whoever gets his next objective get the Fe he does that when he presses all
3:29:49
anyway so is he really bothered yeah true yeah I think if he loses the other half that's when he's got to be
3:29:55
concerned but H looking a little bit frightened about how this one's going as there's the ulti forward giving fer a
3:30:02
bit of his own medicine as a twisted advance to lock him in place there are the Feats going over but hle have taken
3:30:07
down the mid laner and they're looking for a baron now as an opportunity yeah very weird to hit 25 minutes Baron spawn
3:30:14
and that's when feeds come through but yeah now down fer no TP as well so it's
3:30:19
a long time before he can be here H are starting the baron Viper is going to get hit by that one Keepers verdict gets rid
3:30:25
of lens which is a large amount of their engage I think staying on the baron sounds like a good idea here for hle but
3:30:31
they do back away I I think wasn't yeah it was down so low they got rid of the engage Gideon
3:30:37
couldn't be in Smite range I yeah he already lost a Smite W to an aurora so
3:30:44
maybe he just wanted oh I think I think he didn't have Smite actually or did he just Smite something there cuz I'm
3:30:51
looking you can see on the bottom left I had him with one Smite charge so I mean it looks like he had it here but maybe
3:30:56
he used unessa it's hard to see sometimes the overlay yeah he smed there so we didn't
3:31:02
have Smite so maybe he just didn't have Smite uh for the baron and that's why he held it either way definitely they
3:31:08
didn't have the confidence to go for it in the end umbe we can get conf confirmation of that as well um yeah we
3:31:14
we just need uh the replay to be in when Baron was there um is is what I'm
3:31:20
looking to know um certainly some weird things going on here yeah uh in this particular
3:31:25
game possibly no it's just uh Nautilus so I don't know whether Nautilus and aora are
3:31:31
going to be enough to take down this Cante before he just makes his way out or kills them as you stands on control W
3:31:38
is going to be able to deliver another void secet towards Viper now they'll start off the baron and it is
3:31:44
extraordinarily teleport available for Zea and H need to get in here it's down
3:31:50
to 50% Health void Seeker this time is going to miss and now the teleport's coming in The Baron's extremely low as
3:31:56
Delight goes in it is going to be the baron secured by Nong shim but the ulti into the backline from Zea might be the
3:32:03
end of Gideon no blastone is going to make sure that that one does not happen and they'll keep a few of these Barons
3:32:08
alive and maybe if you're on stream you're just saying it's kind of worth I mean it's still 1,000 gold in the
3:32:14
positive thus far after losing their bottom Lane yeah King has a lot of wave clear the only real big wave that was
3:32:20
there is bot Lane which Fisher is just picking up right now um so not ideal
3:32:25
obviously it would be nice not to lose ad carry but I think they're kind of okay it depends what H Le can do here
3:32:31
cuz it looks like they time take is Bid inhibit Tower I think if that goes down got feel less okay I'm going to say that
3:32:37
it's probably worth of HL at this point in time as taking this inhibitor going to provide them with a whole lot of
3:32:43
strength in this uh lead up towards the next dragon and it'll lead up towards
3:32:49
the next Baron in fact as it's going to take some time of that inhibitor to uh
3:32:54
repair itself yeah not the end of the world I feel like of all the inhibs to lose mid
3:33:00
definitely the the least problematic you know you often have someone in the mid lane pushing away that anyway get a
3:33:05
replay of the situation and I think jiu is so focused on damaging the baron this
3:33:12
stun comes in he just gets CC chained getting a good job of securing the objective but as soon as J goes down you
3:33:18
know you have no chance of fighting this the bar Reco you see fer was just leaving he's just out he's just out yeah
3:33:25
he like n guys we ain't going to win this one you're on your own buddy I mean the right call keep as many of these
3:33:31
Baron Buffs alive as possible ultimately still a positive Baron power play we can see in the top left but haven't really
3:33:37
been able to make much happen those inner towers for hle are still up and standing and I'm not really sure n Nim
3:33:44
are going to find a way to punish so I think we're just looking at this next dragon in a minute 20 the focus point
3:33:49
and if H are the ones that take it down then it's going to be two dragons a piece which hasn't moved the needle much uh as well so I think maybe it's next
3:33:57
Baron that we're going to be considering uh that should be the big one but uh the Drake is going to be the next one that's
3:34:03
up so that might be where we do see another fight and if Soul Point does come in then that is definitely a lot of
3:34:08
value and you got triple evolve now for for he's now got his upgraded shoes as well which feels pretty nice yeah when
3:34:15
when the pen has the pen boots as well so a lot of magic penetration available there yep vo seers already hurting and
3:34:21
it's going to be they will be Hing a lot Viper does have the ga and is starting to pick up some armor pen I mean there wasn't that much armor on the other side
3:34:27
still want it but uh going to be a much harder Target to take out now they has that res available yeah and I think uh
3:34:35
just definitely needed that uh he was certainly getting uh thrown into the washing machine over and over
3:34:41
again and probably just wants to not let that Wombo Combo be the of him every single time as is here catching waves
3:34:48
towards the top side and J is going to be able to push out this bottom side wave as well so Nim even able to get
3:34:54
onto the map to try and get some Vision around this uh dragon that is now spawning but everyone is not quite here
3:35:01
Fisher with teleport can certainly join let's see whether it is going to be soulle point for Nim or whether hle just
3:35:07
going to be able to even out the dragons there's another zooming teleport from the ambessa oh here's another yeah
3:35:16
okay in com Z and Gideon from over the wall I think they know that it's a bit
3:35:22
of a shaky peanut when it comes to the smites so if Gideon can get in there and make them nervous it could be a tough
3:35:29
one he just flashes in they dive on top of theia who does go down to the ga pretty immediately and now Fisher's in
3:35:35
amongst it King and trying to get out of there the problem is Viper comes back alive and then they threw their kitchen
3:35:42
sink and Viper said I don't mind that's actually okay will take the objective
3:35:47
yeah the G really paying off there yeah I would say that like this is where you should probably have a look at the inventories I don't know whether they
3:35:53
would have made the same play as that buff was kind of cute but L is still going to die Viper going to be able to take down his ex Griffin teammate on the
3:36:00
bottom side of the map and uh yeah H just uh continue about their business I mean it was played so well by Gideon
3:36:07
it's kind of the frustrating thing but counteracted by that single item uh which makes it hard to bounce back so
3:36:14
goes for the Flash so Viper has no time to react and the C follow up is there and then J is kind of forced away forced
3:36:21
The Flash away from Z who just re soul and the keeper verdict hits too yeah and
3:36:27
I think that g will be out to fight the keeper verdict hitting it meant they just weren't really in position to follow up despite the good initial play
3:36:33
and I kind of think it's showing some of the issues with Nong shim's composition into H like they're so they have to kill
3:36:39
Viper really for them to win especially now he full build but there's a lot of things that make it difficult you know
3:36:45
fact he's a z fact you have your MAA your poppy uh the threat of the Yon and you can definitely see how even with
3:36:52
some excellent engages like that it can still not be an ideal fight yep and uh
3:36:57
Viper is now at 350 CS here at 32 minutes um which is almost a flame
3:37:03
Horizon has six items and so the Z is kind of like it's it's just ticks you
3:37:09
know in the boxes outside of using the ult in that previous fight but I don't think we're worried about that too much
3:37:14
no one's that tanky shim so Viper will just shred everyone so quickly everyone
3:37:19
is just probably going to die and P's got a rer and he's not really too worried about what kingan's doing and
3:37:26
you can see that Z he also has one and he is also not too bothered by anything at all so the baron going to be up in 25
3:37:32
seconds time and I think hle should be a little bit more confident in their ability to stick around this time yeah I
3:37:39
will say though I think Nong shim need to be oh Gideon don't want this one V one this is uh this is not what he
3:37:45
wanted he wanted to be uh yeah a little bit more stealthy doesn't quite work out here Zea does need to kill him before
3:37:51
his soul rebinds and that is not going to happen so he's out but all down be a
3:37:57
bit frustrating and he kind of has to make his way towards Baron which is up I will say G is down so this is kind of
3:38:03
what Nim do want to play around the fact that viip doesn't have that but without V yeah then what's the point that's a
3:38:08
bit of a dangerous one is yeah there's the keepers verdict from the shadows and King's now out of the fight that is going to be a free Baron because they
3:38:14
also had the his grasp just to make sure that no one could get in you know I'm I'm just not really sure what kidon was
3:38:20
doing there specifically you kind of isolated you kind of alone it was it was a it was a p b flank it it felt like a p
3:38:27
Bay flank yeah a little bit a little bit not on the right Champion but it was certainly um it was a it was a deep
3:38:34
covert covert ops mission yeah and now H with Baron uh you know they have taken
3:38:41
down all structures outside of Nim's base a little bit tricky to crack I mean they obviously already taken that in him Tower mid but uh looks like they're
3:38:47
trying to immediately set the pace here and protect this wave TP from Za specifically I guess just to Mak has the
3:38:54
pressure only some casters so Viper also sold his uh his G because it was on cool
3:38:59
down and built an armu guard so that now he has another way to mitigate um outside of just being able
3:39:05
to use his ultimate now has that other way of doing so so if that kitchen sink is thrown then he just spams the arm
3:39:11
guard button and when he comes back out does have that feather storm to continue doing damage has that mobility and all
3:39:18
that sort of stuff so yeah he knows that in this game the vi is pressing r on him and you can make it as undesirable as
3:39:25
possible for the P but there still do not really a better Target unless Zer massively misplays all his this tet is
3:39:31
very dead yeah they're going for the long flank here um can they do that before the Nexus explodes that's the big
3:39:37
question as even HLA a bit confused about where Gideon is as he walks over
3:39:43
the wards now all right charging up that Vault breaker will be able to get in but Delight just says no my friend that is
3:39:49
not going to happen the Alti through from Zea there as well Blas con's kind of frustrating is now everyone's piling
3:39:54
in Viper goes golden but he's in among so many bad guys gets a big shield and
3:39:59
he has already altered but he kills two of them on his way out it's lens the poetically gets the kill but it is still
3:40:07
the end of the game as hle will March down this bottom Lane and look to take down the turrets you know a miracle
3:40:13
atakan steel kept them in the in the game but Nim just can't to enough the peel available to hle they shut down the
3:40:19
flank attempt from Gideon and even though Viper does go down in the end enough damage is done and H will claim
3:40:26
that first NEX of the series y you can see that you know the spirits were not too down on the side of nim king and hav
3:40:32
a bit of a giggle here I think they knew that they were gifted another chance in this game didn't quite get there Viper
3:40:39
was yeah pretty absurdly powerful in that particular game and once he figured out the right items to build the things
3:40:45
to have in that inventory it was kind of all over here for for Nong shim another
3:40:50
dra next time he did he did die though which is more than KT managed that is very true and in fact he died like three times uh this time around uh that's a
3:40:58
very cute poppy picture and of course yeah Delight having one hell of a game like I don't know who is p leader for
3:41:05
you at the end of that one because honestly the way Delight was following up on all of those engages I really
3:41:10
enjoyed it but uh Viper is very good at uh at Z I don't think boom boom damage
3:41:16
vote though I don't know I can give it a Viper yet when when he died with UB I feel that's kind of yeah Zas was also
3:41:21
ganing a lot we got a lot of that that team fight towards the top side when he got the triple knockup yeah
3:41:27
true I think that's the thing with p is like you can have leaders after game one you don't have to be really locked in
3:41:33
yet and Z doing a crazy amount of damage actually in that's more damage than I was expecting right now for me Zas and Delight are probably leading after game
3:41:40
one we'll see what happens if hle are able to win the series um outside of that you can see that g was able to land
3:41:46
a lot of void Seekers kingan did a lot of damage there as well but unfortunately it just wasn't quite enough and Fisher kind of left us a
3:41:52
little wanting with his ambessa playing mid yeah J was seeking the void a lot never really finding it yeah until hle
3:41:58
kind of put him in the void and we'll see what he does come out with uh when we get into game number two time for us
3:42:03
to go to a short break the space afterwards will be breaking that one down a few interesting replays to go over I could imagine and then we'll have
3:42:10
game number two we'll see you soon

3:49:00
hi welcome back to the space here as it is geneng G taking the victory over Nong
3:49:06
shim red force or my life yeah I when I was practicing this I did that in my
3:49:12
head and I was like oh no it's h life you're not going to mess it up when you go live but it's live we're not recorded here welcome to space I'm Deon this is
3:49:18
uh yeah whoever and uh behind deon's crazy brain what a wild and wacky look into
3:49:25
deon's no the reason why Deon is a bit F off as I think we all are was we already were and it was great but it was
3:49:32
shocking on the receiving end of a bro two and now we just witnessed hum life
3:49:39
barely beat Nim kind of they were super hard winning early stomping stomping it
3:49:45
was like we were like wow I guess this is going to be one of the faster games of the Season we were bro we were brainstorming comedic segments yeah and
3:49:51
then there were some errors of judgment some potential missed smites uh that should have been hit and that's why we
3:49:58
could do if you don't Smite yeah you can't miss it all right let's take a look at the highlights from this last
3:50:05
game uh let's talk about this one Deon yeah you know what this dive was not uh
3:50:12
cut and dry I'd say a little soupy you like there's one of the Newton's Laws um that every action has an equal and
3:50:18
opposite uh reaction usually in League of Legends you know you can't win on both sides they kind of broke the law
3:50:24
here Gideon man I you can't just cue him like and actually Gideon later has an
3:50:30
insane play on viper with the flash Q either got to wait it out or or or ult
3:50:37
you know like flash don't give the response time but that is where the game starts to devolve cuz it's just that
3:50:44
those two two plays but that's where both Zas is fine lot of resources are wasted the Viper starts accelerating and
3:50:51
things quickly go out of hand from there sure and credit to Nong shim for not
3:50:57
crumbling at that moment where both things go wrong at the same time our next highlight shows the big fight back
3:51:02
that they had creativity coming from lens as it was 2034 with the Aon fight and lens has
3:51:10
found his way into the bush behind everyone else and they were joking him on the cats are like yeah what's he
3:51:15
going to do he's actually going to lead the charge for the nongam comeback yeah and I I think obviously compositions
3:51:21
like the one that nongam put together here aren't as gold dependent as a lot of other comps at this point in the game
3:51:26
even from behind you can make a heroic play like this chain CC even onto a Zia can prevent her from actually escaping
3:51:32
takes a ton of damage here sure she gets out of the initial exchange but no are able to because of Peanut's lack of
3:51:38
smite here able to also secure the oton buff and they clean up from here and this is with Gideon at the beginning of
3:51:45
this play as well and it's really telling that even despite getting the
3:51:50
other com off despite winning the fight and despite then trying to get the most value out of the buff in the subsequent
3:51:57
Skirmish they never actually breached it there was still like always like 2 and 1/2k gold behind which really says a lot
3:52:02
about the state of the game before it happened and it also showed how hard it was to kill Viper because that was like
3:52:10
old from The ambessa Flash old from uh from the the from lens right so there
3:52:17
was so much shed up there and then it just it did matter and it just it was kind of sad cuz I feel like at that
3:52:23
point I kind of wanted no shim to win because it would have been funny and then they didn't like like bri they did
3:52:29
Bri did win and they didn't I just I don't know this this it was messy there was D isn't
3:52:36
playing today what is happening we intentionally decided to skip the parts uh of the Aon buff duration and how that
3:52:42
was played out um cuz it didn't didn't look so great most of it yeah it didn't look so great and basically there was
3:52:49
one more opportunity to take Baron later on for I think 6 minutes after our last replay chronic is really excited about
3:52:55
this yeah and you know we had the Hanway life Eagles baseball player come last week and if there was going to be a
3:53:01
baseball player on the side of Han life Esports who else then Delight let's take a look at that I got nothing now Deon
3:53:08
you said what I was going to say I'm sorry we didn't practice it now you might wonder that's jungle why does that
3:53:14
matter as we have a really nice great job observing shout out to the team uh production there it's because that was
3:53:20
the what was it level 18 level 17 kingan that was desperately trying and was the
3:53:25
one that got the Aon in the first place and was trying so hard he's the only one
3:53:31
in this fight realistically can actually lock them down and prevent The Retreat cuz winning the fight or before the baron is taken or preventing the baron
3:53:37
from taking stealing the baron those are not realistic options but if kingan can get there and lock them down in his ultimate maybe they can take three of
3:53:43
the Barons off get some gold back but just kicking him away means it's a free Baron it's a free back super easy really
3:53:49
well played by Delight who picked the poppy in a situation where I I really didn't expect it they set up the draft to look like it was going to be Z Recon
3:53:55
he's like nah just in case we get to win some objective fights later on I got you especially given that Gideon was on a p
3:54:03
bites Mission beforehand and unfortunately got spotted you know it's where you're trying to play Hitman and then you just walk into the garden he's
3:54:09
like why are you here and you don't you don't have an answer it's just you're cooked that's right don't forget he the
3:54:14
Home Run champ is Delight they're up 1 Z here on Nong shim red force will they be able to close it out or will Nong shim
3:54:20
battle back let's find out I don't know digon but uh Nong shim
3:54:27
will at least have side selection moving into this one so maybe blue side could help them out they did show that they
3:54:33
were able to fight back even though it was looking pretty doomed and so perhaps the bear paws are going to be able to
3:54:40
crush the orange that uh is the bear Paw's wielded by raccoon you know all of that sort of
3:54:45
stuff yeah yeah we established this earlier if you weren't there this might not make sense you need keep up that orange was falling apart yeah it was
3:54:51
falling apart at a segment missing my goodness the battles are pretty uh
3:54:58
pretty intense when it comes to the fans of both of these squads juice spilled oh yeah on the battlefield mhm well the
3:55:05
raccoons are definitely absolutely adorable and so that's very useful now CH you can see I think the hair is a
3:55:10
little bit more must than it was last time around and you can see D is a little little bit uh calm confident and
3:55:17
we'll see what they have planned for us as we head towards this draft for game number two yeah I think the thing I'll
3:55:23
say is that H haven't looked infallible generally but particularly even last
3:55:28
game yeah um there was some oofs there was that dive that they kind of butchered and gave ji kills there was a
3:55:35
whole atakan to Backle um so as much as obviously they're still favor they just
3:55:41
had to convin a game one I don't think it's a sort of out of any Realms realistic like it's not like ji beating
3:55:47
bro like that's that's that's insanity this is you know this could happen yeah and look at the look at the picks from
3:55:53
the last series like as far as iconic champions for these players you've got like Z's Cante is very good at that one
3:55:59
peanut was basically undefeated Forever on maai it's yon for Zea it's Z for for
3:56:05
um VI so like give them the op champ yeah give them all their op Champions and then they just don't have for the
3:56:12
rest of the series genius and it when they all have them at the same time
3:56:17
means you get rid of all of them cuz you can't just lose five times in a row as you're getting rid of them you know exactly exactly you know maybe want to
3:56:23
something um yeah scarner unsurprisingly going to be ban again Zyra taken away
3:56:28
and the Jace so two picks I feel like the only link between them is you often have a lot of pressure with them uh fast
3:56:35
player speed on the Zyra CH a lot of pressure we just getting like the standard bands coming out from H Le uh
3:56:41
with the cler coming through again it will remind you the both Baris and Ash were banned in the last draft and
3:56:47
they've been left available Rumble also was denied from kinging cuz they had a popup performance last series so you're
3:56:54
limited in terms of what you can get rid of from here yeah and if it is like a varis or an ash I think that makes sense
3:57:01
uh for Nim yeah you force out the varas span because otherwise you get Rumble
3:57:06
right and they now have to ban Rumble and then you get VAR and you're kind of happy about that one as well yeah I
3:57:12
think it's one of those things where maybe the call is just don't ban one of these massive Ops and they opt against
3:57:18
that they ban the varus so now it gives a lot of freedom for Nong shim to to get a powerful first pick thing is with
3:57:23
being on red side there's a lot of Ops open blue side can only take one at first they will take that Rumble for
3:57:28
King in last time he played it absolutely popped off how many of the really powerful picks are there
3:57:35
available though like what are we going to lock away that's going to say Checkmate uh to this situation I feel
3:57:40
like we are running low as far as those super over power Champions are concern
3:57:46
yeah maybe like uh Sani I was think Sani definitely one peanut does en jooy but
3:57:51
actually going towards the zenz here which you know I mean it's been serviceful we've had some decent performances but it's not been like uh
3:57:58
oh this pick is super broken sort of thing um I think dong definitely feeling fine right now yeah I wouldn't mind like
3:58:06
something Broly I think a Gallo sort of fits in with that one especially if they can freely Flex that one around of
3:58:12
course we've seen Gallo work on the top side of the map so far this season but also in the mid lane it's a it's a really duy mid jungle but also you know
3:58:20
when we first saw Gallo come into Top Lane it was specifically as a counter the rumble that's what I was thinking
3:58:25
yeah and it's Zas he can kind of play everything we know that this guy really does like to Branch out as far as his
3:58:30
champion pool and Gideon going to take that sajwani oh no have decided to lose
3:58:37
that's a bit weird um oh no um so it looks like it's going to be the Gallo
3:58:42
top and for those who aren familiar corki is currently 0 and 10 0 and 10 on
3:58:47
the lck Zero wins 10 losses um Zer is going to choose the
3:58:53
thing that he feels like playing um I think the smolder would have been okay too but instead it is going to be the air Fair bit of magic damage meaning
3:59:00
that Viper can freely pick something with heavy ad towards that bottom side of the map doesn't have to worry about
3:59:05
zigs and Kaisers being banned away yeah of course Kaiser is already banned because F the benefit as well is when
3:59:11
you're on red side in this situation you can have counterpick support and you get first choice of V carries so
3:59:17
it's it's kind of a double wmy in this situation if you target one of the pools you can get First Choice and then
3:59:22
counter whatever else is left open they do go for the Leona ban initially though denying that once again from the
3:59:28
hands h okay Ezreal going to be taken away from Viper I think that's a good one I even think that uh Caitlyn kind of
3:59:34
works in a composition like this having the extra range would be nice as Misfortune taken away from J wanting to
3:59:40
make sure that they don't have that full Mega Wombo with The Equalizer bullet time if someone does get stunned up by
3:59:47
Gideon or some such yeah I mean some of the ad carries left open or you know like Jinx uh Jin
3:59:54
you know some of the things that we've seen a little bit definitely getting down sort of list like Zer I'm not sure
4:00:00
you need to focus that much on ad carry Bounds at this point last be scared of like a there's a lot of peel for like a jinx so that can make sense if you go
4:00:06
without one yep um yeah I mean I think a lot of teams i' be like just pick the ad
4:00:12
carry here get Choice from the pool left and then get counterpick but when you have Delight I feel like Delight is just confident to pick engage supports in or
4:00:19
whatever so you can just pick like real here and be happy yeah I think actually be fine I was thinking Viper would go
4:00:25
back to his Caitlyn feels like something that could certainly work out this but
4:00:30
no it's just you know those are the decisions do we want to give Viper a choice to give him the kin or do we just
4:00:36
want to stick the light on an engage pick he's good with and maybe the thought process was guys re and raana
4:00:42
open yeah unless they're going to play real raan bottom Lane we're going to be fine I'm sure that's what Cory needed to
4:00:49
get his first win oh we are okay we're Luan naming it has been a long time
4:00:56
since we've seen Luan Nami in the bot Lane and ultimately oh wait does this mean that we get Kate
4:01:02
Lux enchanter V enchanter will Delight do it will he break them all I feel like he'd barred first but not he's going to
4:01:08
lox it there we go okay so one of the things here is I think I think when Nim
4:01:14
locked in the Lucian Army you went into that like we need to Lan swap because already you know playing The Rumble in
4:01:20
the Gallo G was a fine match up there although Gall is pretty fine Lan stops just tank on a tower but like Lucian
4:01:26
armi level one into Kate Lux is painful and really Lucian armi like it's weaker now than it was but it's very much a
4:01:32
lane where like the mid game Spike was like the driving force and Caitlyn Lu is
4:01:38
like well our mid game kind of sucks if we're behind but we'll Crush you in Lane yeah so I I think that's kind of the
4:01:43
lane dynamic make that n want to avoid uh and so I think heavy research
4:01:49
needs to be done level one into finding out where uh we're going to see H send
4:01:55
those laners yeah I think that uh it's going to have to be all about the scouting Crews heading through see where
4:02:01
these Champions are going to be going more absolutely adorable raccoons love it when NS here none of them draw with
4:02:09
you know with oh there is the guy from before uh Z just getting the head pets
4:02:14
absolutely adorable I you know I'd be so thrown if I was if you in Z's position
4:02:20
you just saw that like it would just be so distracting like like hang on a second and it just said B all around him
4:02:28
um don't know what that means but it was uh it was very cute this is also very cute our first Lucian armi towards the
4:02:33
bottom side of the map um just don't know whether it's actually going to work because H's composition looks really
4:02:40
scary to deal with especially as you get later on let's see what the noodles can find some
4:02:51
[Music]
4:02:59
magic all right I love that the Nim fans are so loud here in L Park it's
4:03:04
absolutely fantastic good to see even though things weren't as good in game number one they are still keeping things
4:03:11
up the enthusiasm is there I'll see whether that means we'll get a game three because this is interesting
4:03:17
is that Z has gone Aftershock which says to me he's like really expecting um an
4:03:25
potential like early swap I'll give a lot of help if you getting dive to the tower but looks like they're just go normal Lanes yeah looks like uh J and
4:03:32
lens are kind of okay with it see whether that is something that will be rewarded or whether this is
4:03:41
folly I'm leaning towards the folly of it just because I feel like them being
4:03:46
able to just consistently hit you from way further away is going to be an advantage yeah yeah it's also the fair
4:03:53
strike Luan which he does proc there but generally Fair strike's really good mid game oh god oh no we've made the peie
4:04:00
with lens um generally feir strike is really good in the mid game cuz you have enough damage to get like substantial goal from
4:04:06
it but like Caitlyn and Lux are notoriously good at proing it that's nearly heal yeah early barrier as well
4:04:13
well from from Viper and now it's cleanse vers heal so I feel like H in the advantage in sort of combat power
4:04:20
left available like obviously you can defensively get out of CC but uh if you go for an Allin the extra healing on two
4:04:26
Targets will have a lot of value yeah feels like the majority of the CC is going to be death um for these two on
4:04:33
the side of hle seeing now this wave is getting stacked up level two going to be gained so some traps able to be laid or
4:04:39
a net available to be used in order to get out of this see what Viper is that has actually opted into him if he has
4:04:46
actually taken anything at all as another Peacemaker comes in oh man light binding being included is a dangerous
4:04:52
one is the heal just being used to keep the tempo up keep them in the lane y as much as they can as yeah here's the zero
4:04:59
and 10 Cory it's our worst win rate here in uh the lck by a very considerable
4:05:04
margin and I think what's telling as well is the fact that like we have a loss from aiming and D Plus have been doing generally very well it's both
4:05:11
groups you know even though obviously group Elder's been winning a lot they've got loss Zack himself has a loss it's a
4:05:17
loss for us too because it's uh Cori versus AIA which doesn't make us very excited yeah I was going to say it it'd
4:05:25
be a win for us if people stopped playing Cori cuz he's losing so much but uh apparently not not to be detd fish
4:05:31
just like I can fix it I can fix the the win rate yeah I don't know about it I am
4:05:36
I'm not sure whether I'm sold um but we'll see if uh if the outcome of this game is going to give us some more
4:05:42
confidence yeah has already had the back and it looks like they're going to lose a plate so
4:05:48
this is kind of what I was talking about and you know what I don't think this is surprise to anyone no apart from apparently long shim um who who did end
4:05:55
up maybe I mean to be fair maybe it's one of these situations where they like maybe they figured that they weren't
4:06:01
able to get Vision so they just see whether H was going to call their block by double calling the block going maybe
4:06:08
it's like in rock paper scissors where you're like oh if I go rock then they'll go paper but what if they think I'm going to go paper they'll go scissors
4:06:13
yeah then they if they go scissors it be right to go rocks I'll go rock again and then you just lose you just completely overthink it you just overthink it you
4:06:19
outplay yourselves maybe that is what went on that might have been the case but uh maybe it was better to get the
4:06:25
information and then just opt out or maybe like just go first back and then go for a bit of a reset but uh you know
4:06:32
we don't know how it all went down and hle oh okay not going to quite
4:06:38
find that one as the Lucent Singularity goes somewhat wide
4:06:43
and already a 4 goal lead between 8 carries yeah strong start one plate already going over which is pretty nutty
4:06:51
going to come through so we'll be able to spend a little bit here oh you actually saw the Ping come out in the brush from Nim so nearly had a chance to
4:06:58
stop B but they don't and it's the St D seen a lot of collector first Caitlyn
4:07:04
which in terms of putting the pressure on in Lane very extreme yeah and it feels like yeah it
4:07:10
rounds out the power Spike uh quite nicely I believe this is is what he went for last time around as well wasn't
4:07:15
quite as successful in that gameit results in a power spread it takes a bit longer to get going but you
4:07:22
don't fall off as quickly yeah it doesn't it doesn't feel like as much of a trough that you're you're playing in
4:07:28
yeah I think the trough ends up coming a bit later if you do end up falling behind but if you're ahead you just you're you're
4:07:34
chilling Z and kingan just hanging out here on this top side of the map Z looking for these taunts not quite
4:07:39
finding them and kingan as well not really doing too much other than throwing some harpoons around and trying
4:07:46
to convince the gargoyle to leave the lane he is uh going to do so by the looks of things roaming around not necessarily on
4:07:53
one of his more notable roaming Champions but uh going to be spending some time with Gideon see whether they
4:08:00
can uh get any early kills because that first Blood helped them get towards beats last
4:08:06
time so far 5 and 1/2 minutes no one to go down just yet I don't know whether
4:08:11
this is the time we're going to get our first ruiners up that's what I'm thinking yeah I mean I I think I think
4:08:18
it's is not going to happen on this pth at all yeah I think it need some serious changes we've tried you know some teams
4:08:24
more than others um but it just doesn't seem like it's plausible and it's funny cuz every time you know I I'll have a
4:08:31
day of lck it'll be just like completely the racious only no runers I'll go home I'll play some solo Q runers every game
4:08:38
every single game every single one it's so it's so funny it's just it's like
4:08:43
they have the professional play uh adakan and the solo Q atakan yeah maybe
4:08:48
it's just a different game uh as peanut going to be able to grab one of the grubs that is going to deny a fe the
4:08:55
strength that's unfortunate cuz Gideon actually saved the Smite so he had a Smite to contest there and unfortunately
4:09:01
M Ed against peut he could have gotten all three there if the Smite was better but peut redeemed himself a little bit
4:09:06
for last game you can see Zea there as well just trying to force out uh Fisher's flash is actually very cute
4:09:12
doesn't actually press his ultimate button so you can go for that one again if you'd like to peanut just going to walk towards
4:09:18
Gideon has level six Gideon does not and that means that uh peanut is going to have full control over this side of the
4:09:26
Jungle yeah able to force them out both of them have Smite again after the little grub battle they had so P he
4:09:33
doesn't use spite though there he can actually steal this as well yeah I think NOS Gideon is there I'd flash for a
4:09:40
grump um but I don't know whether it's a good idea not going to do that I flashed for last before absolutely I mean I flash out of
4:09:48
Fountain just to get onto the map faster and unlock hex flash absolutely get on Co down otherwise
4:09:54
you're not utilizing it Zer is doing battle with Fisher he's really testing he's like I'll do
4:09:59
it and the more times you do it the more you're going to lure them into a false sense of security you know like he won't
4:10:06
do it but maybe he will cannons going down on both sides I'm pretty sure both
4:10:11
of them got those so that's certainly good news Delight going to secure that one for Viper who's held on to a 22 CS
4:10:17
lead something about that it's going to be softened a little definitely wanting to go back home as lens's probably not
4:10:23
wanting to tank that but Evan flow should be able to help him get that health bar back up no Mana Len's pretty low Mana so you know potential to put
4:10:31
some pressure on but it's it's good timing that Gideon is actually hanging around there is a w that would spot him out if he moved so you can tell that hat
4:10:38
want to apply more pressure in this bot Lane 2v2 but kind of cautiously respecting the Poss ility of a gank for
4:10:44
the threats but now end up getting another plate in the bag oh dear now
4:10:50
Singularity goes down there as well and there is the extra Auto attack to grab themselves the plate I know obviously
4:10:56
like level one's pretty strong this combo but I feel like you know when you hit Level five oh oh equalizer Z's going
4:11:01
to have to flash out of that one yeah a lot of respect shown going do a lot of work even the spect car is not tanky
4:11:08
enough yeah I feel like once you sort of get a few points in Q or for Lux in her e the damage threat feels a lot more
4:11:14
significant you know you get like an uh ad item behind Caitlyn and suddenly if you get hit by like a peacemaker without
4:11:20
it hitting any Targets before it really chunks so yeah things get a little bit worse before they get better for G the h
4:11:27
o nice bubble will connect here tital wave to follow up as Delight comes on over gives a bit of a shield here to
4:11:33
peanut who does have the Crescent guard up an available light binding the full combo Empress divide needs to be flashed
4:11:38
there from Zea but now he's in an awkward position peanut coming back in again because he identifies Gideon has
4:11:43
no damage and in fact no one does uh and in fact no one's going to die and we are just going to use some Summoner spells
4:11:49
and wander down the river very strange passage play you know Gideon nearly basically solo killing peanut and then
4:11:55
zacha tries to get a Shuffle on Fisher this time he does get away from it uh a lot of back and forth a lot of Summoners
4:12:01
used across the board no deaths no Fierce blood oh another bubble will connect here but I think they realize
4:12:08
peanut coming in not going to be an option so it's another case of you know
4:12:13
the Caitlyn not really finding as large of a Suffocation lead that she can often
4:12:19
do as we were expecting I think getting through this Lane relatively well especially given the item disadvantage
4:12:24
that he's had for what feels like forever yeah he's with in the storm for now so so gone pretty okay all things
4:12:30
considered and he is going to get that big mid game Spike but um still I mean the C has an edge for now and it can
4:12:36
obviously explode quickly if you get some free time on the tower but for now I think onong shim can be okay with how
4:12:42
things are planned out yep first dragon going to be going on over it is going to be a cloud next which makes me a little
4:12:47
bit disappointed because there's no Cloud soul but at least it's on the map that makes me happy could be earthwind and fire as well as Peanut's going to
4:12:54
come on over and spot out Gideon trying to steal away his Raptor camp and Z is continuing to really have
4:13:01
some trouble uh into kingan LeAndre is almost done I love how you can play the
4:13:06
anti Mage Champion right who has like a free like magic damage shield and just
4:13:13
build early Mr and you're still getting toasted by Rumble well hens is not having a great time as peanut is
4:13:19
fighting into three people does have that cring D like we were talking about final Spock misses on La hens somehow oh
4:13:26
man I that was an elevation problem or something like that yeah High Ground low ground I think Delight was trying too
4:13:31
hard to hit multiple people with it just gone for lens would have hit his Mark
4:13:37
was like you know what I can make it happen I can bend the light like gravity does that's really cool
4:13:43
unfortunately he wasn't actually able to do that but it's his theory there's the calling Viper somehow not hit by that
4:13:50
glacial prison just needed a little bit more muscle thrown into it yeah now n
4:13:55
can just get all three of these grubs so full set just contribute a little bit towards those Fe and still no one has
4:14:01
died nope which is kind of absurd it feels um when was our when was our uh latest
4:14:08
First Blood 15 minutes and 5 Seconds ooh so we're getting close three minutes away which I think even more amazing is
4:14:16
that it was diable killing Barrel um yeah Barrel really
4:14:21
bar that long to die yeah yeah he's got to pace it up a bit he
4:14:27
either dies or he gets his ad carry killed way before that in fact the earliest one was in fact Gushi killing
4:14:32
aiming at 1 minute and 34 seconds which I if anyone remembers that was absolutely bar
4:14:38
100% oh beautiful times I'm glad that we can both remember that off the top of that has those exact stats have to look
4:14:45
up when the latest one was but the earliest one certainly know that one don't forget a moment like that no no
4:14:50
text book um as Delight down towards his bottom side clearing out some Vision we see who's going to be able to uh get the
4:14:57
most pressure on these turrets you can see Z is actually pushing in as well and with Caitlyn position in the mid lane should be pretty safe to try and just
4:15:03
clear waves might be an opportunity to try and go for the first turret but instead we're setting up towards the
4:15:10
dragon pit doesn't have a dragon in it for quite some time
4:15:16
okay yeah you can see the uh taunt going to be used but the damage from kingan is
4:15:22
kind of insane another equalizer comes down justice punch was used kingan needed to block that if he wanted to
4:15:27
kill Z but not quite able to get in front of it and so the gargoyle will be able to walk away but yeah he's just
4:15:34
he's up in Gold he's built Mr like what do you want him to do and still King
4:15:39
looked like he was just going to kill him yeah um not quite able to do so but you can see the control of the lane is
4:15:45
still kind of there for the rumble I think one of the things is you know
4:15:51
maybe I don't know maybe maybe if you had something like the grasp you had a bit more trading power early you could have put on more pressure H yeah kind of
4:15:58
feels like maybe the the After Shock was more like hey I'll have this tool for the the dive that never came but also
4:16:03
we'll have it for team fights and stuff like that valuable there but it doesn't feel like it as much of a a laning sort
4:16:10
of uh situation side Lane's going to be a little bit more difficult as Fisher so far deathless like everyone
4:16:17
else so the Corky going just fine yeah just have to see whether it continues to
4:16:22
go just fine as lens moves over looks to try and clear out this control Ward es and flows
4:16:29
butse things are looking a little bit worrisome as the sand Soldier attacks are starting to rack up the damage less
4:16:36
than a minute to go oh this going be a record breaking game yep 14 minutes and
4:16:42
20 seconds on the clock right now we're looking to beat 1505 and the thing is even if they fight for this dragon or
4:16:48
this Herald the record will be achiev by then you know exactly cuz we got 48 seconds that's what they're waiting for
4:16:54
only need what is it 30 seconds on the dot as of now so unless J just walks up and dies
4:17:02
we're feeling real good in he's like I don't want us to be the record no no records for
4:17:09
you oh Gideon over here as well is our final evolution kind of cute and now
4:17:16
lens moves up to join his ad carry 21 seconds now and for the main stat it is
4:17:23
5 Seconds Away 2 3 4 and there it is
4:17:28
there we go latest First Blood of the season has been achieved but how much
4:17:33
further can we get it there's the stat no longer will we have Dia and Barrel on
4:17:39
our sheet in front of us with the cool stats on it as we might have uh First Blood just being replaced only a few
4:17:45
seconds later as King in that's a great flash as Zea comes in as well and M just
4:17:51
died to the ramped up turret it's kind of hilarious tidal wave is going to connect onto Viper here as well has to flash the
4:17:57
bubble and there's a lot of action and we still haven't replaced that first Blood were they aware like as soon as
4:18:03
the time have passed everyone starts fighting yeah I think that must have been it they're like we're going to break this one like saying an old TR
4:18:09
guys give 20 seconds sweet 20 seconds as soon as it pass is like boom lock in
4:18:14
well they all locked in and didn't really achieve what they wanted to achieve that is going to be second Drake going on over and it's a hextech soul my
4:18:21
God that is a high powerered dragon as the gold is entirely even
4:18:27
there is absolutely nothing in it I love the little bounties just sprinkled in little 19 gold here you'll have 29 extra
4:18:33
gold it's just it's well when you get a kill like before is quite H it was quite consistent with like rounded numbers it
4:18:39
just feels like you get random numbers of gold oh should be connecting here onto D he is
4:18:45
going to use his cleanse and I don't think they're going to be able to get the eye that's
4:18:51
unfortunate as all right Zea will find the emperess Divide onto King and is it first Blood wow that was a NY in
4:18:58
Ultimate from Gideon but it scared them enough to get kingan out of
4:19:04
there no one will die no one will die I think everyone's Immortal oh imagine if
4:19:10
lens just popped in like one shot to that you know it's actually first blood it's going to end of that situation where
4:19:16
everyone's super farmed and no one's died and you kind of like don't appreciate the fact of how much damage everyone's doing yeah they'll pop
4:19:23
you maybe this is how uh Ki finally wins a game no one is actually going to
4:19:31
die this could be it all right we're doing okay let's do a prediction when do you think first blood is going to be oh
4:19:39
um I think probably like oh we'll watch this replay
4:19:48
first prediction uh so the the old just plays the entire wave TR even goes in for the Canter minion it's like get out
4:19:53
of here even manages to get Flames bit of value on the peut on his way out as well I like how we get the point of view
4:19:59
when this lack of kills this game is um I
4:20:06
think maybe like 2220 2220 long way away actually yeah
4:20:14
actually I would say like know I
4:20:20
could I'm thinking it's like 9 uh sorry 20 I'll go 21 20 21 20 21 10 21 10 2110
4:20:29
2110 all right I don't believe quite that hard I'm going to go 1930 okay that's pretty close yeah I reckon it's
4:20:36
close ion we re something's something's going to go wrong around an outan that's about to spawn I get that I feel like
4:20:41
neither team maybe I mean that's that's perfectly valid I think it'll be on the dragon and that someone will just die around the
4:20:48
dragon oh yeah I need someone to die in a minute I think it's also it's that uncons thing where when no one has died
4:20:53
in the game you don't want to be the first to die you feeding so now it's now it's everyone's going to play a lot more
4:21:00
safe you have then you have infinitely more deaths than everyone else so and infinite is a lot infinite does feel
4:21:05
like a lot yeah so everyone's just you know they happy farming away put some Wards down oh my Ward's dead that's fine
4:21:11
at least I'm not yeah yeah and the out of turrets in mid lane uh up and available um you can see Lucian is you
4:21:18
know struggling to hit it which is a problem but it should be okay um okay
4:21:25
well I need I mean I need someone to die in 25 seconds what have I done why did I
4:21:30
make why did I make that call Peanut go in quickly whether it be to die or to
4:21:36
kill I just need you to get in there oh unless all right kingan in a bit of
4:21:42
trouble is actually kind of turning this one around he is a tank yeah he's also just going to let King have the wave and
4:21:49
that one is going to fall down I mean yeah 2 seconds to go I'm cooked I'm cooked oh it's over all right okay I
4:21:55
just I didn't want to do the same but also it felt like it was going to be so far you could still be closest but if it
4:22:02
goes after it's yeah no I think I'm I think I'm just uh I think I'm just done you just cooked
4:22:07
y I mean yo is the latest then we then he might be best might be best
4:22:14
off let's see I think we've got a whole bunch of uh predictions coming on in there wolfes was completely cooked a
4:22:21
while ago um me and him are already out of the running's got 20 20 seconds is
4:22:27
all right so so does Bren and valders they've both got about 20 seconds 20 25 and 20 24 and we're starting to see some
4:22:35
uh some grouping up H not going to go for anything though without a Gallo within heroic entrance range oh my God
4:22:42
he Auto him yeah there we go celestially opposed it though he's celestially
4:22:47
celestially opposed to violence he is in fact everyone in this game is has a lot of uh okay brendon's out deon's out ma
4:22:55
is 21 minutes he's next up all right what if maybe we're all just incredibly
4:23:00
wrong someone in chat would have said like 43 minutes and they'll be
4:23:06
spot um arakan is just going down oh going be it oh no Viper and Delight just
4:23:12
cooked together and there it is first blooded 2050 and it's King in that takes down
4:23:18
Delight Zea now looking to try and stop them from taking this Aon down as peanut
4:23:24
going to be pushed away when becomes lightning coming on in there fish down relatively low they get rid of the
4:23:32
a but Z comes in that is going to keep PE alive Viper fighting against King and
4:23:37
there are a lot of traps all over the ground and nongshim they give up on the aan they get El first blood they get the
4:23:43
Feats the sandals have been put together you know you know what the worst part what I I wouldn't have minded
4:23:51
but it's Mao who won and you know chronic he's always he's always so yeah he really does like to he's like oh I
4:23:57
was correct yeah you'll have a smug smile on his face right now on the you know he will why did you remind me I can
4:24:03
see it in my mind so I he's just that guy you know so frustrating what can we
4:24:09
do I was so close so close if theay last a little bit longer and now Delight has
4:24:14
infinitely more deaths than anyone else I know it's embarrassing isn't it but at least you know he's he support Lux you
4:24:20
can have that excuse of like well I'm so squishy it's so hard to do my job and not die all the time yeah as opposed to
4:24:27
support an army who's notoriously very thany and if your lands just in general
4:24:32
who does spend most of his time dying uh Z is just going to walk at Fisher here it's looking super effective as now got
4:24:40
another fight as peut getting Absol abolutely slaughtered gets himself a decent Shield though and in fact his
4:24:46
ultimate's going to be coming up very very soon King in getting low as Viper grabs it with a peacemaker that was
4:24:52
adorable he not going to get spotted out here as Viper's going to need to flash over he does so light Bing not going to
4:24:57
connect as now J way too far up but there's the knock up from peanut that is going to spell his death is now the
4:25:03
flash in the Twan Tor and zaka Scoops them all up h i mean they may not have
4:25:09
got first blood but they killed the rest of them when it RS it pause when we get some kills coming in h clean up and
4:25:15
we'll get that third Dragon of a hex de Soul which is pretty rough for Nong shim
4:25:21
they have may been the one they have may they may have been the ones to get first blood and the feature strength but a
4:25:26
huge blow dealt to them but they don't have strength of feet which is what you need in order to walk into the right
4:25:32
position and they're far away from their souls being secured um anyway yeah V is
4:25:38
hitting King on of the wall and he gets hit by the Lu because he was channeling his old uh unfortunately yeah Viper with a
4:25:45
peacemaker out of nowhere so close but so far and just the no attack speed which I mean it's
4:25:51
regular you can see him trying to get the Autos up there on doesn't doesn't do enough and they Shuffle pretty big
4:25:58
gorgeous and we're seeing there the combination of the gallo and the air when when Gallo was a midlaner it felt
4:26:03
like it was a bit sad because the combination is so fun if you do get the Taun then the shuffle becomes so easy
4:26:11
right you just scoot on in and knock them all back and we saw exactly that in
4:26:17
motion there and now all of a sudden it's a 3,000 gold lead it's sole Point yeah they don't have feet but who cares
4:26:22
you don't need feet to kill dragons don't or do you it does help I
4:26:27
think uh I mean copia is fin kill dragons oh yeah um is that in the
4:26:33
law not that I'm aware of but I've seen it in game she does have a lot of DPS
4:26:39
against Dragon right yeah that's true and and
4:26:46
yeah I mean Nami but she's she's on long side so yeah not working out quite as
4:26:54
much yeah footless Champions don't have exactly like I don't have that database in my brain yeah well definitely not Bri
4:27:02
that was established early on that one's definitely definitely Fe clearly are
4:27:07
there Gideon has six feet in fact uh if you include bristle
4:27:12
uh which I do absolutely and lens is now just in
4:27:18
trouble although Viper is now potentially in trouble Za showing off with the amount that he can tank the
4:27:24
culling which is a lot I think you have to include bristle because it'd be very weird if Sani was just walking around on
4:27:29
him all right L okay is the hole not going to connect well actually does connect not going to kill um Z moving on
4:27:36
up you can tell that we're getting a little bit loopy it's been a weird game right we had a 20 minute First Blood which is quite late and we're used to
4:27:43
having a Cadence of action that's a little bit higher than that as you can see here in the gold difference I mean
4:27:48
it was nothing nothing nothing until that last fight towards the bottom side which is I imagine the first highlight
4:27:53
we're going to see from the space probably um because nothing else happened prior to
4:27:59
that hens he could die but there is Gideon in the vicinity and Zea needs to
4:28:04
go golden AR enough traps going to be going down here as Emperor divide delivers a pig towards delight and Viper
4:28:10
that equalizer actually um isn't the greatest and no were able to walk this one off you know I joked
4:28:16
before about Nami being tanky but legitimately like lens keeps just brushing off this damage uh and Landing
4:28:23
everything he needs to to survive now fer oh dear I thought arakan was going to get mad oh uses the arakan to uh
4:28:31
provide an audacious charge Target but not really working out there oh you know that it's such a new objective I can't
4:28:37
is this the ruinous or the vious arakan how can we tell you know I don't know I
4:28:42
imagine it's ruin cuz there was so much so much action in this game it probably is the ruinous one the one when you have
4:28:48
a lot of action um Zea it's one of these oneway trips didn't really have an Exit
4:28:54
Plan no that was not that was not the one as I think that fer is in a tough
4:29:00
spot yeah Justice punch going to come in fer thinks that it's not well named that did not feel like
4:29:06
justice as arakan is continuing to be somewhat ignored as kinging over here
4:29:11
does have five grubs worth of extra damage on these turrets which is providing a little bit
4:29:17
of an issue Delight immediately flashing out and I don't even know whether that's going to be enough saved by the popcorn
4:29:23
chickens you love to see it okay respawn timing planned Del I had that in mind
4:29:30
absolutely and all right Nim now with control of the river towards this Northern side of the map feels like the
4:29:36
Lucian Army pressure really online now like you have the rapid fire can of the extra range the I
4:29:42
not not to the Gallo but everyone else yeah ution is doing damage so after seeing him do so much damage before that
4:29:49
really was um a bit of a let well if you look at Z's it you can see all the arm oh no he doesn't have any armor right
4:29:55
suspicious interesting very strange uh this aan
4:30:00
is okay peanut coming on in let's see whether he can cause some sort of rockus as Gideon already going down low Zea
4:30:07
splits up the fight but there's a lot of damage from Fisher here the tidal wave helping out really well bidan goes down
4:30:12
first and now the heroic exit there from Z but they're all on the barbecue and
4:30:18
they just back away as arakan is left to the wolves or they're going for like a re-engage I have no idea but they're
4:30:24
sort of still here and sort of not Z has teleport and so he can make his way back if they would like him to be there and
4:30:31
now they're just going to get gifted out oft no he's going to reset this is so Weir that was so strange I have no idea
4:30:37
what just happened there but it was I think okay for hle King moving in doesn't have equalizer for the next
4:30:43
little while Z is coming back and hex gated yeah hex skating again oh he's getting on in there there's the TA it's
4:30:50
going to connect on to kingan but he is able to cook them takes down the Smite that is absolutely huge as now Zea gets
4:30:56
out of the way of the calling but it's not enough to save the gargoyle and I'm
4:31:01
still confused this outon has just been running a mock wait we're hex getting more we're back in and now their jungler
4:31:07
is going to come back over Gideon will turn up again and I think the Nim just get
4:31:13
it right yeah they should just get it yeah God so weird man I being such I
4:31:20
don't know such an odd we had bro to earlier and this game feels more odd
4:31:26
yeah right that's because bro are the best team in career we knew that from the Kasper cup yeah I mean they are the
4:31:31
Kasper Cup champions the last time gen G won some was all the way back in MSI um
4:31:38
yeah so a lot of focus on a Gideon to get rid of the Smite and I mean it is successful in the end but a lot is
4:31:43
burned and I guess that's why they didn't want to go back in for it but like if you get rid of
4:31:50
everyone it's okay they just don't want to face check yeah and they're waiting for Z to come in but you see Z goes in a
4:31:56
little early he up follows and they get melted doing much damage yeah both of
4:32:03
them uh then King and cat is able to escape Z has no cool Downs really chase them down and the adakan just kept
4:32:09
resetting yeah all over the now Nim heading towards the baron because they may as well peut if he can steal it away
4:32:16
certainly still incredibly valuable as hextech Soul was I believe secured by
4:32:22
hle in the meantime as well so that is going to be a whole lot of power especially with the Caitlin my goodness
4:32:27
as juu leading charges yeah um
4:32:32
what I know they they can't technically die but Viper won't need that many
4:32:38
shots in order to do it so annoying yeah bazinga all right in goes peanut it's a
4:32:43
GGO delivery system as they knock up King and evict him from the area Empress divide connects onto a couple everyone
4:32:51
is sent packing and yeah you may not necessarily die but you give over 400
4:32:56
gold in a baron probably not worth yeah we were stuck in the replay and it's kind of like okay you got adakan but
4:33:02
they got hex all I just the yeah it just wasn't worth it you know and they're
4:33:08
just permanently getting AOE slowed chunks po out you know and yes these
4:33:14
deaths aren't as important as if you didn't have the attam buff I mean it serves the same purpose though doesn't it yeah you lose Baron and H still have
4:33:22
hexol which they'll have for the rest of the game yeah and Viper is heading towards I believe blood thirster uh item
4:33:28
number four um and item number four is where Caitlyn becomes a big old Champion again um you're very very happy with the
4:33:35
state of the game and he's two3 so he's already dealing a lot of damage oh man Z
4:33:40
going to be able to move towards his top side ize these Barons and yeah these a and the holes starting to hurt still has
4:33:45
another point to put in that one I believe as oh yeah he still has the buff so he may as well take a ticket
4:33:51
home I mean I mean yeah I don't know it's it's that it's we had last game
4:33:58
like yes you you it's not a big deal if you die but you don't have to just Dash
4:34:04
in and and just I mean it's still I mean it is faster than pressing B yeah at the
4:34:10
cost of 100 gold and a whole flower that's true yeah yeah you always forget
4:34:16
about the blood pedals maybe Viper going to hit rank three ultimate you know like earlier
4:34:23
because of that it was all the blood pedal y all right H uh okay tial wave
4:34:29
going to come in there the cleans going to be used from Viper as a whole bunch of buttons are now on cool down and I
4:34:35
think that uh nongshim used a few more yeah four of them now on CD and fer is
4:34:40
doing his best to put his on CD as much as possible as H just going to continue marching forward because their health
4:34:46
bars have not been changed because now on like connected to every attack they
4:34:51
now have basically an ultimate ability that slows down everyone in an AOE it's just
4:34:57
nutty this hex tech soul is no joke and Nim they are good at clearing waves they
4:35:03
will be able to do that as the push does come in uh it does come to a close but
4:35:08
ich have now got a 5,000 gold lead it's a 3.3 Rebel Baron power plate i' say
4:35:14
approach it's so hard to approach the second you walk up you get autoed by rapid fire Caitlin and your whole team is slowed yeah or the turret just
4:35:21
explodes that works too my goodness okay yeah kin doing some damage as Viper is going to be able to finish off the
4:35:27
inhibitor it's bit of a bit of a fake out H Zer is just going to take the enemy hex Gates uh in order to get out
4:35:34
of here so 2 minutes on the Elder Dragon and I think that's where we're
4:35:41
going to see the next commitment to a battle and one that Nim sort of has to
4:35:46
do but they're in a really rough spot they actually want to win it and having a look down at the red
4:35:53
numbers the red numbers are not telling a good story for nongin fans no it's pretty rough I mean honestly like the
4:35:59
Gold's bad but it's just uh you know I keep hammering AR about it but like it's just such a weird of passing to play
4:36:04
like guys got the other Camp oh we lost hexol and then attam buff gets used and they just have this buff forever and it
4:36:10
just feels almost impossible like the game felt you know it was back and forth it was close and now it just feels
4:36:16
really rough and I mean the Corky corki is yet to do anything I'm
4:36:23
just going to say it yeah yet to do a single thing and in the lck cup he is
4:36:28
staring down 011 it is approaching yeah well uh There He Go he's going to press
4:36:34
his ultimate button fer is desperately trying to get himself a kill as The Equalizer comes through there's a heroic
4:36:40
exit that is going to be interrupted and H get themselves out of there you know he he he nearly got he did get peut
4:36:48
below half Health he did near got and he made it so that peanut had to move from
4:36:53
where he was going to be otherwise oh they make it m one oh in trade for an
4:36:59
inhibitor Top Lane they gave up on it they don't want anymore okay and maybe they don't actually have to give away their inhibitor Top Lane as Delight also
4:37:05
taking way too much damage here fer has come through to do an auto attack that was cool teleport is going
4:37:11
to brings as into the fold though and he him as far as the front line is concerned is looking pretty dangerous
4:37:18
these final Sparks not doing as much damage as uh we can sometimes see from alux but she is very supportive with the
4:37:25
Redemption completed as well as the mes K has to deal with this wave and eler dragon is about to spawn they'll be able
4:37:31
to head back and uh thanks to the hard work oh but they're going to be late he
4:37:36
gates gates oh man about those
4:37:42
I mean it's lot accurate cuz Caitlyn is using them a true there we go uh but they are walking in the fog of War yeah
4:37:49
well J and fer going to walk out and take a bit of Health from Z as all right blasone is going to get
4:37:56
Fisher over the wall no one has started off this Dragon so HLA will be able to actually get here it's going to be an honest fight as that didn't look honest
4:38:03
at all looked like Zea just killing Fisher without him being able to do anything in response little bit trying
4:38:09
to Res just there for sure okay uh Z's going to be able to make his way through
4:38:15
final spark just to get some Vision as now Zer and Zas are going to turn up together this angle is terrifying locen
4:38:23
what the heck was that damage that's I guess Viper with four Adams did finish
4:38:29
that blood thirst that we were talking about before the line of traps comes in as peanut gets out of there does soak the ultimate as the title wave is going
4:38:35
to stop the light from work walking further forward but they're using all of these buttons defensively they're going
4:38:40
to not have have them for when the fight starts in Earnest fer teleports back it's your time corki it's now it's
4:38:48
time to find a win this is where we do all the damage this is where we steal
4:38:54
the Elder this is where maybe you just lose as they're teleporting into the base the end the game K needs to go he's
4:39:01
the one with TP um well Nexus turret one is dead Nexus turret number two is dead
4:39:06
fiser is almost dead lens is in fact dead there's a knock up onto Gideon as they just diving forward they're going
4:39:12
to win the team fight and the game at the same time as it's a double to come down for Viper and fer is likely to not
4:39:21
die wait he's dead I said likely to not die I meant
4:39:26
the other way arounder is wanting to kill kingan his ex teammate um before actually killing the
4:39:33
NEX I think he ran out of Minion wave there as well um but he's just going to follow him and going to help out and
4:39:40
thumbs up occurring all over the place oh the scrap Shield he's Scrappy and the
4:39:46
minions they get it done in the end as well as LeAndre and so that is going to be Zea going golden didn't time it quite
4:39:51
quite right as uh H are delaying as best they can and that is going to be the two
4:39:57
successful there the latest first blood that we've ever had plus well not that we've ever had but that we've had so far
4:40:03
in 2025 and it is above 20 minutes it's going to take a while for us to get a
4:40:09
new one of those when I saw that damage on the hands I was thinking it was like that thing I said where like not much action happens everyone just Farms up
4:40:15
and then you hit a like game fight and sudden you getting one shot another that did happen did happen that's a cin thing
4:40:20
too and uh look I'm I'm going to be bump with it h definitely some things to work on considering the strength of this
4:40:27
roster and the fact that they are the reigning summer Champions I think there is still a higher expectation but in the end of the day they got the 2 another
4:40:34
point for group Baron closing that Gap a little bit Yeah 5 to n now as well in fact Elder losing both of their matches
4:40:39
today y so you know maybe comeback yeah comeback is indeed exactly the term that
4:40:46
I was going to use although I'm not normally that uh scientific with my word
4:40:51
play uh zy yeah not looking too enthused right it's not one of those games where you're like Ultra celebrating afterwards
4:40:58
I think Viper had a really good day uh his Caitlyn was very very strong as well as his uh Z game that you know he had
4:41:05
some hiccups yeah but he played the early game exceptionally well yeah I mean I think the thing is like I'll be
4:41:11
real when it's Viper my my standards are very high so when he like dies without Ting once on Z I'm like I don't know but
4:41:18
uh generally who gets who got the pom for you then uh I gave it to zacho um
4:41:25
all right I think the Y game was pretty good I think air he was solid maybe my
4:41:30
expectations for z y are way too high he did he got that SI triple knockup that
4:41:35
was he did get that sick triple knockup he had a lot of pressure I just think like I can't give it a peanut cuz the H
4:41:40
can incident I can't give it a Viper cuz the ho didn't and died incident there's a few incidents that people out the light had
4:41:47
infinitely more deaths than anyone else in this game he so long as well and played
4:41:53
Cante yeah that's and then Gallo no I cannot condone so this is Delight not
4:41:59
getting p as we can see here in this highlight um and the rest of the plays Delight actually lands quite a few kqs
4:42:07
andu like pry good but infinitely More Death infinitely more deaths than everyone else you know and he also missed that
4:42:13
ultimate in the river that was weird that was really nicely played by Viper in that moment connecting the net for
4:42:19
the guaranteed head shot and jiu almost had enough damage to be the absolute
4:42:24
hero you know I feel like if if Lucian armi was still really strong like it was like however many years ago he would
4:42:31
have just killed everyone yeah but it's not and they did um this was Z getting completely
4:42:38
trolled by lens um and then himself at the I don't want to talk about this CU this kind goes against the
4:42:45
p p so does that does that like contribute to the illegality of the whole situation or no as this fight was
4:42:52
definitely all hle the whole time nice little sweep there from Zer as well as
4:42:58
this was to get rid of all of the Aon Buffs as L takes just a a very free hex
4:43:03
you know uh it's kind of like we have that chem Soul Vibe but neither team cares for super long time this kind of
4:43:09
felt like oh guys we it just appeared look at that Isn't that cool Jay just he was he had those little
4:43:15
rocks he's in his he's in his lab and he comes out like I guess now he discovered
4:43:21
it but it was earlier in the season than we were expecting or something like that oh already we had like a whole pop point
4:43:27
and we thought he was going to share it with the people cuz jayon is a good guy but no no no no no no the Monopoly is
4:43:33
there for that whole that transition from I don't want to be used as a weapon to using it as a weapon went very fast it did I just
4:43:41
progressed so fast very quickly it like they condensed season one and season
4:43:46
into a single game it was a great synopsis but I just didn't know it was a synopsis it's like there's people who are like oh I watched it like you're oh
4:43:53
have you seen aane yeah no but I I watched someone summarized it on YouTube in like 30 minutes yeah exactly I
4:43:58
watched the YouTube video explaining it so that I could talk about it with my friends so you didn't watch it yeah exactly you didn't watch it like
4:44:05
chronically you know all right dong shim I mean they it a crack
4:44:11
they actually did a fair bit of damage here you can see that the damage graph is uh very uh similar outside of kingan
4:44:18
doing a whole lot more but he is a rumble but look at that gold graph man it's like we started the game we literally started the game at 22 minutes
4:44:25
yeah you can't it's just invisible know that's just I mean basically we did
4:44:30
basically we did start the game in 22 minutes we did I'm surprised that the damage dealt pre 14 minutes is actually
4:44:36
larger as Viper is going to get it in the end um I'm with you I think that
4:44:42
there was some illegality there but perhaps uh you know the Korean side didn't hop on about the not use of the
4:44:47
alt and his Z game was still very very good is uh Caitlyn also looking
4:44:53
impressive actually kind of making up for what was a bit more of a disappointing Caitlyn performance uh when he brought it out against I believe
4:44:59
it was J earlier on yeah I mean to be fair like I don't think it's a bad P I'm not going to like disagree with anything
4:45:05
it's just you know my standards for Vi are high yeah you know in fact our standards for all of these players are really high maybe that's why it just
4:45:11
felt like a really difficult decision felt like a difficult P we expect we expect a lot you know hle lot of good
4:45:17
players on this roster a little bit of a goofy series but they got the win they did absolutely just like bro you know it
4:45:23
was a goofy series they got the win as expected up against gen and our first series of the day a weird one but
4:45:29
definitely a good one for team Baron and we are getting very very close to that interview with Viper as well who will be
4:45:35
able to tell us about the minations and how things are working fitting into the
4:45:41
team things like that whether they do have High Hopes heading further on because I'm interested to hear Viper's
4:45:47
perspective on that one yeah I mean it interesting how things of jel in general
4:45:53
as well I mean you know H have looked good right uh generally in the the
4:45:58
series against KT they smashed them but they even in summer when they won the whole thing it's not like minute one they were just dominating yeah exactly
4:46:05
but let's throw it over to D for the translation with v thank you very much guys this is your
4:46:10
for the P interview translation joined by Viper on the side of H life Esports congratulations thank you H life Esports
4:46:18
has secured their second win how does it feel to get P
4:46:24
Viper honestly I don't think it was I guess you guys give me a lot of
4:46:35
credit today must be group day
4:46:42
did you happen to watch okays bring yeah I was cheing for them really
4:46:47
hard what was it like no as I was watching they they won
4:46:53
the first game so I was like are they going to keep up the momentum and get
4:47:03
it talk about game one your SC scaled so
4:47:09
hard the car old difference was in men surely Z was the opponent's main target
4:47:15
so how are you able to scale so well you know lately we've been seeing
4:47:21
so many Lane swaps so I think that's why carries end up scaling so well I don't
4:47:27
think I did anything particularly well it's just that's the way the game just the way how slow nowadays so I
4:47:36
don't think it was anything special two
4:47:42
we got a Lucian Lami versus Kaitlyn Lux match up and it's been a long time since we saw these comps so did you predict
4:47:48
the Luan B now after the enemy finished their
4:47:55
bands I kind of did predicted and that's why we ended up locking in our own comp
4:48:00
based on that and I think it was a little tricky
4:48:05
because of all the long ranges that we to deal with and yeah there was actually no action until 20
4:48:11
minutes and it was the latest First Blood did you have a plan or was there a particular reason you were just trying
4:48:17
to be extra careful you know to be honest I think we
4:48:23
might have had to play a little more aggressive and I think maybe more trades would have been more beneficial for
4:48:29
us the enemy just had advantage in terms of range so it's actually ended
4:48:39
up that's how it ended with no action I believe and this Saturday you will face
4:48:45
theia they've been playing oddly well right now so what is your mindset to go into your next
4:48:54
match you know I feel like lately we've been seeing a lot of variables that will
4:49:00
change the the way the game flows and D plusia you know they've been really
4:49:05
really good so you know they're going to keep us on our toes but we're going to make sure that we do really well
4:49:13
and and that's the end of the interview with Viper and back to the space thank
4:49:22
you thank you very much dear aaya as it is a clean 20 nothing to see here by
4:49:28
Hana life Esports over nongshim red force and uh just like they said in the
4:49:34
interview they're right it was a Barren day group baren day I they probably also
4:49:39
meant group bro day because the Bros kicked it off with the two win but either way let's take a look at the
4:49:45
player of the match the votes there on the bottom obviously Viper getting most of them uh Zea vote there by I'm a I'm a
4:49:54
big Jonah strong fan yeah but I did watch pen miss his Smite on an Aon which
4:49:59
at a like 25 his zenzo game was cracked so that might be a situation where you
4:50:06
go the the second game was really good and I think the cost also also highlight there were a couple of reasons not to go
4:50:11
for some of the other votes I'm glad there's no theight votes though that would have been that would have been a toughy I felt like no one was incredibly
4:50:19
impr like no one was super stand out um they put the Woody voice thing here I didn't actually specify that that that's
4:50:26
a chronicler thing um you got to do the voice you made him specify it yeah come on I I watched the Dutch version of this
4:50:33
movie man I can't do this do it in the Dutch version then I have no anyway made come
4:50:42
and that was basically what it was in English there's a sake in his boots
4:50:48
there it is Boom done that's all I thought I thought Viper was the most consistent player that that's all I I I
4:50:53
felt like it was a team effort no one really stood out that much so I'm not that like it was 100% Viper today that's
4:50:58
all I wanted to say all right Cy let's see yours yeah I was going I was trying to contest with Cloud Templar I don't
4:51:05
think I really nailed it I had a couple of versions but this was the most the most basic both by Viper viciously it's
4:51:12
just basically insiration I don't think it's anything crazy but you know Viper I think he was he was good enough Ox with
4:51:18
the zot here uh yeah didn't ban yon and made some plays on it as we saw yon
4:51:23
isn't good chovi didn't win today that did happen right that did
4:51:29
happen yeah it was a while ago but not that long ago we we watched that yeah yeah interesting let's see what the Korean
4:51:36
side had to say I want to hang out at the rift
4:51:41
Viper you know just two chill dudes hanging on the rift I would like to get some Freo from him as well uh you know
4:51:49
let's do it que up get Viper in your game I don't know Cloud Templar I'm sure he still is a mean to Mumu after all
4:51:55
these years I believe it perfect Professor Viper deep cut here from Rascal anyone
4:52:01
know this I think if I remember correctly but that might be off baser it's because Viper used to be one of the
4:52:07
guys that played everything so he was called the professor cuz he played Teo he played in the awesome dude meta he was one of
4:52:12
the most first up players when he came up with Griffin so I'm there's a lot to learn from him also in you know even if
4:52:19
he's not trying to teach it you know he's kind of spilling knowledge all over the rift one more do we have one more
4:52:25
yeah you let Viper Zia open okay so the inverse of what Ox put from Helios I I
4:52:31
don't know if there could be possibly a bigger disconnect between our opinion of Zia and the Korean although to be fair
4:52:37
like Viper is one of the players Viper and Goa the two players for me that I'm like okay well I'll allow it ruler is
4:52:42
probably a close third but what is your opinion on uh Zia crony I think it's fine in specific
4:52:49
spots I think teams are prioritize a little bit but I don't have the same level
4:52:55
of that's not actually an official um Raman
4:53:01
flavor Ram I thought he was also going to say it's cuz he ate it as far as
4:53:06
lines have gone I think Pony is Pony is hitting some highs man probably I love
4:53:13
Pony he's one of my favorites but I feel like this one's definitely like not his top three probably not his top three wow
4:53:19
I think it's good I like it Pony's pony pony won today's uh quotes he was he was
4:53:25
on form today yes let's see how han life took this Victory on form as well first
4:53:30
one starting off at 22 minutes with the Corky again no wins getting caught
4:53:37
out cor just it can't catch a break break wolf but that's not where this fight really goes AR it's the fact that
4:53:45
we are fighting in this narrow choke point and we're throwing damage into the zenzo I just don't I I don't understand
4:53:52
why kingan I mean I could see the thought process behind like oh they're collapsing on corki I need to rotate over and maybe see if we can bail them
4:53:58
out and turn this into a favorable fight for us but when you're playing a tank Champion or an engage Champion maybe
4:54:03
that's the right call but when you're playing Rumble walking into those three Champs oh into the Gin I yeah here this
4:54:10
this is kind of painful if Pina doesn't have a z that plays great the real the the biggest issue there was that Z was
4:54:17
actually behind him uh TP behind him so he I I think maybe that was but by the
4:54:23
time that zos actually was there I think he would have had plenty of space out and get towards his team no just look
4:54:29
all over the place yeah I feel like it wasn't the greatest series from Hond life Esports either I think we have a lot higher expectations of this team a
4:54:36
lot but you could see some of the mechanical moments there right they were able to set up some combos Z to punish Nim pretty well they definitely were by
4:54:43
far the more experienced and stronger team today but we expect a little bit more yeah and and again remember First
4:54:48
Blood was at 20 20 minutes 50 seconds again M just getting the uh prediction
4:54:54
correct again let's take a look at the second highlight here as uh Aon strikes again at 27 minutes it it lands a lot
4:55:02
doesn't land too many of its abilities though uh autocon doesn't but interestingly enough neither do a lot of
4:55:09
the players uh the light I don't think has hit an old I don't know watch what zeka does in a little bit here also just
4:55:16
doesn't really spark any Joy uh the rum Rumble also doesn't kill him it's like
4:55:23
maybe where they're retreating might have been the better path to go it's just it's obviously both teams are prioritizing this objective so highly
4:55:29
they want they want it no matter what I think there's some tension here no one is playing at their best as aon's trying
4:55:35
to hit his skill shots here like oh do I flash over am I going to do it Aon is just confused as to what is going on I
4:55:40
thought talking abouton flashing over like y should I flash for this I mean it might have considered it we're just
4:55:47
getting dragged back and forth and then the the previous fight was a little bit messy uh and I think here we were also
4:55:53
seeing why we just don't see this Lucian because I feel like J obv had a bad play
4:55:58
towards the B side of the map but like okay so taunt misses Pina just goes in
4:56:04
watch what zeka does here he's just kind he's there he's there
4:56:12
the calling just goes into nothing yeah um utions burst damage can be quite
4:56:18
helpful especially in a winning game State this is kind of what he was used for with Luan Nami Lane is to win Lane have a strong mid game and then no get
4:56:25
it and they lose hex soul and then they just kind of whiffed the buff and that's
4:56:30
I I feel like this draft here for Nim really hindered their chances of Victory and the Lucian pick was kind of like oh
4:56:36
we fell into the Caitlyn trap here what do we do there's so many things banned uh uh let's play uan and it just didn't
4:56:42
work they couldn't get to the mid game they wanted yeah definitely not they take the loss here as it is hung life Esports getting the victory as we take a
4:56:48
look at the standings after day number two of week number two and it is group
4:56:54
Baron day as they take both victories over group Elder still trailing 9 to5 a
4:57:00
4 game gap here but hanell life ESP Sports on top of this group as expected
4:57:06
it really defies any expectations that DK is the only team hasn't been been yet
4:57:11
now most likely hanwa should be the favorite going into the match if you look at the pre-season expectations but
4:57:18
we have the level play even here today I I predicted D and I'm feeling pretty good about it yeah now tomorrow
4:57:25
is is is uh two bangers right I think we're going to have pretty long day of LSK tomorrow I don't think that DRX or
4:57:31
bnk will necessarily take a dominant win although bnk do look to be the favorites right now and then you have the Telecom
4:57:37
War T1 stabilizing a lot after that first loss to D+ and KT rolster we're
4:57:43
not really sure where we're at on the roster coaster right now but I'm I'm leaning towards T1 being the clear favorites there as well yeah they should
4:57:49
be which should scare everyone cuz let's be let's be real it's KT and I think
4:57:54
they haven't looked good at all yet I think that cousin bdd haven't hit their level and that can only mean that
4:58:00
tomorrow they turn it on that's right tomorrow is going to be the LI lith Miss test litmus test for goodness gracious
4:58:06
litmus litmus test for both of those Squad ODS and we will have that action for you tomorrow make sure you don't
4:58:13
miss it thank you so much for spending the day with us and we'll see you again tomorrow for more lck action
