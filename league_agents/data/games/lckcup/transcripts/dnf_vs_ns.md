3:46:00
[Laughter] [Music]
3:46:10
baby for anyone who missed it uh welcome to the universe in the world BR yeah we
3:46:16
do have uh a kid and I haven't left the house very much it's been uh a lot of
3:46:22
caretaking a lot of uh fun times though it's very very uh rewarding fulfilling
3:46:28
and all that good stuff but at the same time I've been very tired most of the days and I haven't done a lot of gaming
3:46:34
as well so uh it's good to be back but um for the last two months is basically what I've been doing yeah we haven't
3:46:40
played board game in I haven't been able to visit many people or do many other activities you haven't existed basically
3:46:47
not really online a little bit online a little bit in in small does yeah it's
3:46:52
been fun I think we've talked about indie games like three times since we've been in in baby
3:46:58
land I did go to I did go to China for two weeks as well for Crossfire and then
3:47:04
I came back I was right back right back in the house and uh yeah no but it's
3:47:10

3:47:35
trips to Busan which was really fun it's nice to go to Busan in the winter um I visited the states for 3 weeks so I was
3:47:42
back for Christmas uh for the second time since I've moved moved to Korea I've only been back for Christmas twice
3:47:47
um in 11 years or something 13 years 13 years Dam uh so you know I've had a little bit
3:47:53
more opportunity to go back these last few years which has been nice um it was fun being in America and eating American
3:47:59
food and reexperiencing American life and being in a car for like four hours every day cuz my parents liveed in the
3:48:04
build of nowhere um so when you want to go do things it's like four hours total of driving like to do everything and
3:48:10
then get back to the house but yeah it was it was fun um I haven't played that many video games to be honest uh during
3:48:16
this offseason just haven't nothing's gripped me I've been kind of taking a break from League taking a break from like my long single player games I'm
3:48:22
always playing like Yakuza and stuff so um once the season ramps up I'm really looking forward to that you know maybe
3:48:28
I'll get back into gaming a little bit after work and stuff like that nice now I went on a skiing trip with you that
3:48:35
was fun uh although I didn't ski but I we did another small skiing trip uh together with aios who most of you also
3:48:42
know uh a uh back any you're forgetting to mention
3:48:48
that works on the L yeah I was cat that sorry
3:48:55
sorry and then some some friends as well and then we even at yo on uh who also works in the lck for the last trip so
3:49:01
that was really fun played a ton of cool Indie Games as well as metaphor which
3:49:07
was awesome I did beat that one yeah that was ah I was about to say that that was really good and I went to the
3:49:13
Netherlands for a good while which was also very enjoyable and now uh yesterday
3:49:18
or like a week ago I was like man I really need to play league so yesterday I played 10 hours of the new season I'm back in the groove a good and a bad
3:49:27
way just feeling absolutely fantastic yeah don't look at my uh opgg it was
3:49:34
great uh as for me I uh did manage to make it back to um Australia we had a little bit of a cat scare so um dong
3:49:42
chol our our White cat was just not very well he's got a whole bunch of organ
3:49:48
failure going on but uh for a few weeks there it was really dicey but now
3:49:54
everything's kind of fine it's really weird he's been getting he has to have treatment every day so we've we've
3:50:00
basically said that he's gone from like just a cat to a subscription model cat mhm where you basically have to pay a
3:50:07
subscription fee every day in order to to keep him healthy but he's very healthy very happy and that's uh that's
3:50:13
the main thing um and then I went to Australia uh which was strange cuz we go from the snow to
3:50:20
very warm and I was only there for a week so it was only a little bit of having that summer experience and then
3:50:26
straight back to the cold again we went uh snowboarding or went to the to the snow for a little bit that was great I'm
3:50:31
covered in bruises we watched a lot of gdq as well that was fun we definitely did do that that was also very very good
3:50:36
and watched a lot of magic don't know why like on the first trip it legitimately
3:50:42
seven hours of magic Gathering no no no it's oh just magic magic that's very
3:50:50
achillo it's very achill that's yeah that's uh
3:50:56
interesting as uh as far as games that I played and here's another one that you forgot wolf played Dragon Quest 3 also
3:51:02
which was uh that that game was a lot of fun y that was uh well we didup as well
3:51:09
yeah um well so kpup feels a little bit like a dream because show the best team in the world
3:51:16
is bro good good treat they it's a it's a good dream obviously they're the best team yeah and and like Hive and like I
3:51:22
don't know that team looked like legitimately bro look good they're actually good now they look good the m is the that later yeah there's going to
3:51:30
be a lot on that but uh the kesper cup happened it was a lot of fun um and I'm so glad that it was like so long as well
3:51:36
like eight days of kesper cup for the first time ever they really like brought it back with a bang and our studio was
3:51:42
also really cute and there was an amazing Japanese restaurant like just upstairs that wolf and I would get every
3:51:48
day it was very good it was super good um so yeah that's about it uh life's
3:51:54
been great though but we're very happy to be back I feel like and wolf you and I I think get this the most where we get
3:52:01
incredibly anxious towards the end of the off season I'm like I have lost like
3:52:07
I I don't have a purpose anymore and I like I need this in order to feel like a
3:52:12
person and so finally the L is back to save our mental state and everything is going to be brilliant

4:01:07
[Music] hi woo
4:01:23
welcome back ladies and gentlemen to the lck cup 2025 I'm Atlas joined by wolf
4:01:28
and we're ready to dive into our second series of the day this one the DN freaks
4:01:34
taking on the noodle Boys on nongshim red Force if you are not as acquainted
4:01:39
make sure that if you are sub to the channel you are spamming flags as much as you possibly can and then hopefully
4:01:45
that will mean that we can get more emotes on the channel so we can spam even more weird stuff the future um if
4:01:52
you spam Flags in the chat you will be flagged as a really cool fan as a flag spammer which is only the greatest the
4:01:58
highest Accolade that you can achieve in twitch chat and so thank you for spamming Flags um this matchup is like
4:02:05
our previous one probably going to be a bit of a slugfest definitely could go the distance you know some people have a
4:02:12
clear favorite on in their mind here in no because the roster is heavily upgraded but we saw an upset in the last
4:02:18
series with DRX taking it so anything could happen you can see it's a completely revamped uh quangong freaks
4:02:24
with the new sponsor D and you have Dudu and Bulldog being the core that stays but piosik Berserker and life returning
4:02:32
from three different regions piosik uh from you know I guess was in lck recently but Berserker and Life coming
4:02:39
from Na and China respectively yep and Rapid star of course coming back back as
4:02:44
well no longer is it cvmax he is headed over to China and so rapid star is going
4:02:49
to be our head coach for this squad and I actually think that the DN freaks can get something done with this roster I
4:02:54
don't know what this is the problem with me like I think that there are a lot of people that like you say feel like Nim
4:02:59
are probably the easier bet but anything could happen with this squad they have the power of piosik behind them which we
4:03:06
don't even necessarily know what that means it's speaking of a very similar thing that we don't necessarily know what it means that's kingan he's going
4:03:11
to be leading the Nim red for Squad here joined by Sylvie and Gideon who has now
4:03:17
come on over Sylvia was playing in Challenger I believe so it should be Gideon starting here today and they've got lens in the support position to
4:03:25
augment jiu who is already their star player yeah it's it's kind of a roster that I don't think really anyone would
4:03:30
have expected with two star players kingan and lens coming through kingan of course a world champion from 2022 but
4:03:38
has been inconsistent as of believe absolutely it is now time for us to hear from Berserker though and see what he thinks about heading back to China uh to
4:03:45
Korea that's what we h
4:04:12
d for
4:04:39
[Music]
4:05:09
fighting [Music]
4:05:14
and some fighting words there from Berserker and uh great to hear that you know now he's excited to be playing with
4:05:20
all of these great players and wanting to get some Revenge under I guess his former teammate you could almost say because Berserker did play for uh
4:05:28
Challenger squad for T1 um and wanting to face off against guchu that's not going to be happening today today he's
4:05:35
facing off against jiu the master jungler that we saw in the show matches
4:05:42
a few days ago now both teams going to be making their way out into lowp park here for the first time of 2025 or at
4:05:48
least most of the players for the first time in 2025 it's so wild that you know
4:05:54
Berserker returns so late in his career after being one of the most hyped up
4:06:00
prospects Challengers he had a pretty dominant you know year in 2023 over at
4:06:06
the LCS a pretty good end to the year in 2022 uh but is now trying his uh his
4:06:12
might here in the lck life returning a player who's very well known for playing
4:06:18
some eclectic picks uh you know his set and jarvin he was most known for in the lck but in the LPL playing picks like
4:06:24
The Rumble in the bottom Lane we saw last year L though no strangers as well
4:06:29
to actually playing those unusual picks so I think we have a pretty fun bottom Lane match up especially with Fearless draft coming up yep I agree and actually
4:06:36
think it's really cool L of the Crossovers here between these two teams piosik and King and of course winning
4:06:41
worlds together life and lens both playing with ruler towards the bottom side of the map the Gen G um there are a
4:06:48
lot of these these sort of things that sort of match up between these two squads um Dudu was just there um towards
4:06:54
the top side of the map we'll see how good he's going to be this year I feel like Dudu just keeps getting better and better um but doesn't necessarily find
4:07:01
himself on rosters that win all that much uh so kingan I think is going to have a difficult task here today as that
4:07:09
looks a little bit painful yeah Pik had that in the Opening match as well you
4:07:14
can recover soon that's a sty isn't it that oh those those things really hurt I hope you recover soon pic and hopefully
4:07:21
it doesn't get in the way as it is going to be Gideon starting in the jungle now this is the point of
4:07:26
contention that I think that some of us have um as oh isn't that a wait which
4:07:33
game is that from the guy that always had the the thing in his nose that was a valerant thing as that was a valerant thing right yeah gen play or something I
4:07:40
don't quite remember I I I will say for me I'm team Gideon I actually prefer to see Gideon play I think he has been on a
4:07:48
lot of teams that have struggled over the years you know his time on KT it was one of their most painful years and then
4:07:54
IG when they were struggling and came into bro and now he's on Nim which is a
4:08:00
somewhat upgraded right more promising roster and I think he deserves a shot here early on in the season I think sylv
4:08:06
has been given a lot of time with no shim and was able to improve a little bit for sure like he definitely improved
4:08:12
a lot over the course of last year especially but I think Gideon has that extra star power to him he's got the extra oomph and extra confidence
4:08:19
confidence in the early games that uh especially with players like lens coming onto the Forefront of this roster i' I'd
4:08:25
pick him as my starting man as well yeah I guess you do need to have the ability to turn on a dime just in case lens
4:08:30
decides to go in and that is certainly the energy that Gideon does have and he had a tough task ahead of him last year
4:08:36
so maybe giving him a shot makes a bit of sense and Life coming back I'm actually just really happy about this
4:08:42
like life was he took a long time to really come into his own and then he was
4:08:48
the guy for so many different things here in the lck you mentioned his set and uh and his jarin of course down
4:08:54
there I don't know whether he's going to be playing those picks not necessarily as meta but there is uh there is a certain pick in the bottom Lane that
4:09:00
this guy on screen used to play before it was even cool are we going to see a leas support wolf that's my question
4:09:07
could be uh it's definitely rap star welcome back yeah rapid star is back it's a huge cheer from the audience as
4:09:14
well I I think there's a lot that you know a lot that we'll see different from
4:09:19
these drafts in this series than we saw in the first series and I think some of the priority in terms of bands especially in game one will be very
4:09:26
different I don't think we'll be seeing the scarner I think Aurora will be pretty consistently banned and there's
4:09:31
especially when you consider how many bands get uh thrown in automatically with Fearless uh some of the mistakes we
4:09:37
saw in the last series were kind of inexcusable and we'll see um what happens it's a new format it's a new
4:09:42
year it's a new Rift as dnf will be taking blue side moving into this first
4:09:49
game yeah blue side has looked pretty strong or at least it did in the first two games of our previous series but let's dive into the draft here see what
4:09:56
is going to be banned away and see what is going to be banned into the future by being picked up always fun when we do
4:10:02
have The Feelers draft and once again it is going to be Varys that will be attended to SC this time going to be
4:10:08
taken away there wolf yeah happy to see that Aurora as well will fall by the way
4:10:13
sign here so V's gone sleeves picks like the Ash and the kalista and the ambessa
4:10:19
at our highest priority if the last uh series do anything to go by nocturn one to look out for as well but pairs well
4:10:25
with the Aurora specifically since she's banned I don't think it is going to be as high pryo corki taken away both
4:10:32
Fisher and Je love this pick so that's not a shock it's a team specific band to come through here that you can afford on
4:10:38
blue side yeah we'll see what the final ban is going to be and then where the priority will lie kalist Ash are the
4:10:44
main ones here feeling like it could be a potential trade so ambessa you ban here but then they get to pick the Ash
4:10:50
and then you're playing kalista into Ash um they'll ban Cante instead the duante
4:10:56
has to be addressed will be kalista that's locked away here I think Ash Rada does seem like a decent idea if you do
4:11:03
want to just take that one away immediately of course only needing to grab the Rada Rada andessa could be a
4:11:08
rotation here wolf perhaps yeah I think that's uh the wiser one just simply because you can still get that Ash on
4:11:14
the third rotation be to keep the ambessa as well Essa not a must pick into kalista not the same kind of low
4:11:21
range uh or sorry not low range but low Mobility uh ad carrier that's super squishy that you want to collapse on
4:11:26
she's already low range so you don't need to necessarily Focus her down with the ambessa they go for the Yon here and they could just go yon Sani Gideon's no
4:11:33
stranger to picking that one up yeah could certainly be the bull if they would like to does mean that they
4:11:39
probably want to get some magic damage towards that bottom side GI of course no stranger to things like the sigs uh but
4:11:45
the ambessa immediately locked in there is the rata that we were expecting they left that one up and available so it
4:11:51
goes over for free so Berserker and life like this is a lot of Bot Lane power to
4:11:56
start things off as they make their way back into the LC and there is that Zig so it feels like both teams kind of got
4:12:02
exactly what they wanted yeah it's it's a solid rotation on both sides and the ziggs just wants to take teleport and
4:12:08
avoid interacting with the rata and the kalista anyways and can make an impact later and also can be Lane swap to the top side I think that's what uh DN
4:12:16
freaks should expect to see but it is very fragile um and I like what dnf have
4:12:22
set up so far so what this ban is going to come through as Rumble okay will be taken off the board here expecting that
4:12:29
we could have seen that ambassa Flex to Mid yeah very strong into the excuse me into the Y yeah an interesting ban um
4:12:38
just because it wouldn't have been bad to pick up but I guess you don't want to get too much magic damage so maybe just
4:12:43
King wanting to head towards something a little bit more on the physical e he could be playing the himself uh
4:12:51
technically yeah true although it doesn't really feel that kinging no um
4:12:56
as the Leona going to be taken away from the hens no surprises there of course great uh Leona player almost said great
4:13:01
lens player which does also make sense cuz he's the only it's also the most common pairing with the zigs great
4:13:07
defensively so makes a lot of sense Malai yeah that's going to be the takea away from Ki of course he does have a
4:13:15
weird champion pool to say the least got cooked up for us with the ad mid that they have here it's a pick that can set
4:13:22
up the kalista incredibly well can set up the ambessa really well and it just makes sense damage profile wise to take
4:13:28
that one away koshik is known for playing the Zyra um incredibly well or even his NY which has been very
4:13:34
inconsistent in the past yeah Nautilus is the other defensive support you can have that's very anti-dive down on the
4:13:40
bottom side cuz what's likely going to happen is we're going to stack waves and then Gio is going to be the target he
4:13:46
has teleport so if he does die or has to back he can get back to the Lane but they want to prevent him from having defensive options down there and we'll
4:13:53
see what the hens has in mind here since we are going to go ahead and lock him the Jace here in R4 so saving that fifth
4:13:59
pick for last even though the ranata is already locked
4:14:04
in a very interesting situation might be the tank variety I imagine that kingan
4:14:10
would be certainly someone that would like to jump on that high train top tank smolder player you know y
4:14:18
not shocked by it if he does go it well that is not a lot of range if the akali is locked in here for
4:14:23
Berserker um and a fun matchup as well into the uh the Y name see how Bulldog
4:14:30
does do in this one is that's a Zach yep that sounds like something that piik would play okay this draft is getting off the
4:14:37
rails it's getting weird and wonderful ah this makes more sense he's played it before
4:14:45
he played it very well before in fact Wukong makes a lot more sense to me ah a real pick there yeah and you need to to
4:14:52
have something that can help get that backline access uh going lock those
4:14:57
players in place for the aalii to dive through with the kalista damage coming on top the ambessa really difficult for
4:15:02
J in this game on the zigs and looks like Alistar is going to be the final lock in here not as strong as rata or
4:15:10
Nautilus at preventing dive but can be played correctly uh another similar way to shut that down if you can get some
4:15:17
knockups there under turret with that extra ramp damage those Dives can be tricky to pull off and with the Wukong lock in here not going to be really
4:15:24
happening I don't think uh pre six to set up a dive I mean it's not impossible depending on the lane state but it's going to be a lot trickier than a lot of
4:15:31
other junglers could uh help you do yeah and I'm looking at these two uh drafts here and I'm thinking that uh the DN
4:15:37
freaks going to have to keep this zigs down as much as possible yeah because I
4:15:42
feel like if jiu hits critical mass everyone just kind of dies cuz they all just have to be together when they do
4:15:47
damage they have insane range like they have the zigs Poke they have the Jace poke and there's there go rapid star got
4:15:53
it in the end yeah eventually you know first try it was kind of like me when I was at the LSK
4:15:58
Awards but I mean don't worry it happens to the best of this they they like you say if if they don't snowball this game
4:16:04
if they don't really get the ball rolling down the hill quickly they just won't be able to reach um it's just as
4:16:11
simple as that sometimes drafts really hit this identity break point where one team is like okay we're snowbally we're
4:16:17
low range but we're going to win so hard it won't matter and the other team is like okay if we don't die early we win
4:16:22
no matter what as well so that's kind of the dichotomy we have here between these two drafts it's not too dissimilar to
4:16:28
what we saw in game three uh of our last series but I feel like this is even more extreme yeah and I feel like both teams
4:16:34
kind of opting into it together this time around instead and I wasn't quite expecting drafts of this explosiveness
4:16:41
uh to be coming out in the very first game but I'm down for it and with bulldog making his 2025 debut on a I'm
4:16:49
hoping that's him turning over a new Leaf you're really pulling out a whole bunch of aggression moving into it
4:16:55
because I think that we didn't quite get enough out of bulldog last year same can be said for the year before and so maybe
4:17:01
2025 is the Year of the Dog let's do it no it's not actually year of the snake let's jump into the ri
4:17:16
okay kingan's at half Health we might have to have a remake cuz the players interrupted the fan chance yeah they
4:17:22
did I'm being uh sarcastic of course but that's why they're going back to base no
4:17:28
significant Summoners or anything were used as far as I can tell just a little bit of uh aggression yep a heal taken in
4:17:36
2025 lens oh my goodness not even unsealed spell as well that's because
4:17:42
life wants more life it doesn't make sense that's what they're going to be doing okay so far uh you know we had a
4:17:50
little bit of a fuffle early everyone goes home and the reset means that uh nothing really comes of it um kingan is
4:17:58
not heading to the bottom Lane because they expect a lane swap but he's like okay I'm going to see what I can get
4:18:04
done here early he's just going to hang out with fer for a minute and try to abuse this aali at level one a little bit um we'll siph in some experience
4:18:11
here too well see what Bulldog can make of this situation you can see already the
4:18:17
minions getting a little bit frustrated as Life coming on over to try and make Gideon's life as difficult as possible
4:18:22
shakes hands with the gromp Gideon will be fine it was always going to be a lane swap with the kalista
4:18:28
you have to imagine right like I mentioned the the stacking of the Waves the DI but they picked Wukong um and
4:18:34
you're like no you know I'm just I'm just not going to deal with it I think dnf realized too like that's probably going to be a lane swap we don't need
4:18:40
this to get a jungler that can dive cuz there just going to be a Jace down here in the bottom Lane and that's what it is
4:18:46
so far gets level two off of siphoning some of that experience in mid lane so he won't be do for anything crazy like
4:18:51
that is going to catch what minions he can here so already a little bit of an advantage over Dudu will also catch that
4:18:57
wave top side and uh plate does go down here in this bottom Lane as well life
4:19:02
taking the demolish just to make sure that they can get some extra value if indeed there was a lane swap to come through so that works out quite
4:19:08
nicely's finally going to get down here I was a little bit worried because you you know I'm I still have the mindset of
4:19:14
the previous year um when lens was a little bit late on The Recoil but it didn't matter because it's so scary to
4:19:21
die of turrets so they didn't need to worry about that one too much as some snowballs being thrown around here by J
4:19:26
I still think that the water balloons are the best but snowballs you know it's nice for a change it's all a theme for
4:19:32
uh what this winter has looked like in Korea this year very true I guess snowy yeah started off like
4:19:40
really warm and then suddenly got really cold now it's kind of warmed up a little bit5 at the moment yeah which is warm
4:19:46
compared to what it can be yeah what it usually is I would say it's pretty warm I might be driving to work next
4:19:52
week as uh yeah so far you know it's just been solo G on the top side the H
4:19:59
is not with him so kind of an unusual setup here land swap as Gideon's coming
4:20:04
over level four yeah going to be out to get that shuriken back lit and the Flash out makes sure that they do not get that
4:20:10
onew punch plus the permafrost which could have spelled the end of bulldog there if he didn't
4:20:16
flash still good investment Dudu is really taking a lot of damage here good
4:20:21
old zigs who uses the Satchel aggressively I imagine Orcs was a little
4:20:26
bit shocked and upset was okay yeah just pushing him and trying to deny him some Farm I think it
4:20:32
denied him one CS there if I saw correctly but he's just trying to put the pressure on with the range Advantage
4:20:38
but he's now out of Mana luckily because he Z he took teleport so can just head
4:20:44
back to whatever Lane he chooses you can see already kingan is heading top side so looks like we're just going to have a swap back at the back timing here it's
4:20:50
actually pretty perfectly synced up here for J because he runs out of Mana right when Berserker is backing so he can go
4:20:55
to the bottom Lane and kingan can get back to the top side not losing anything here so this early game pretty well
4:21:01
piloted actually by Nim so far you can see a significant gold Advantage for G and he skipped the kalista aspect of
4:21:07
this entirely yeah he not doing too badly just trying to get through it is
4:21:14
sort of the aim of the game here on the Nong shim side so avoiding Berserker and life as much as possible sounds good as
4:21:20
Cannon unfortunately not going to be picked up here by the new uh freaks
4:21:25
bottom laner but it'll be all right get the experience for it at least see what else he can do after Lane
4:21:33
swapped away from the hardest part oh life making his way in there's the flash handshake gets the flash out of fer
4:21:39
immediately as in fact it wasn't I think he had the the handshake yeah they're towards the end so just going for the
4:21:46
flash Logistics program or protocol whichever one it is it's named very weirdly that ability loyalty program I
4:21:52
think loyalty program yeah it's one of those it's it doesn't really make sense for a projectile that Shields you yeah
4:21:57
well I mean it's like I'm loyal to my 80 carry I shielded them ah I think um well
4:22:05
here's that teleport here now to the Top Lane for Fisher as we're just kind of
4:22:11
doing a revolving door Lane situation kind of like what we saw Ines up a little bit where doesn't really matter
4:22:16
where you're swapping like the zigs can go mid and we Champion somewhere yeah
4:22:22
just get the farm where you can get it Z is just going to be moving to the mid lane now feels a little bit early
4:22:28
for that sort of swap but that is where we're at if you can be the first one to swap you can control Temple a lot like
4:22:34
this as you can see in the bottom Lane like kinging gets there first still has his teleport is pushing on the bulldog has to catch the wave so he actually
4:22:40
gets first roam um so they're setting the tempo it's going to help them uh secure these first few grubs or at least
4:22:46
the very first one as they have the positional Advantage right now JW has old yeah not going to quite find J there
4:22:52
who is able to get himself out of the way that is two grubs going on over to Nim I don't think they're going to be able to get the feet of strength points
4:22:58
here as pik's able to Smite away one of them so no one with any feet just yet
4:23:04
well you know you know what I mean feat yeah feat featuring two grubs not three
4:23:10
um yeah which is unfortunately featuring nothing um again though you could see like they
4:23:16
got two out of three um you know kingan had the faster Ro was able to get out of
4:23:22
that lane faster now gets the faster return is going to catch that wave and these are you know the small advantage
4:23:28
that could stack up you know if we see a bigger commitment see if they are able to punish kingan for this it doesn't
4:23:34
look like that will be the case nope he's going back by the look of those
4:23:39
items not sure exactly what's going to happen here is it going to be the fimble witer is it going to be the man immune uh yeah we don't know yet yeah he did go
4:23:46
for grasp so I'm leading towards the tank build yes I'm uh you know we just saw a lot of yeah no it's happening it's
4:23:53
happening again yeah um just seems to be the agreed upon way to play Jace I think
4:23:58
that's all right I think in this game though it's definitely a much better situation for the Jace um he still has
4:24:04
to go through an ambessa and a Wukong but it's not quite the uh Cante scarner
4:24:10
level of uh tanks he has to break through so makes a little bit more sense in this particular game the setup of the
4:24:17
draft and I mean he has a slight lead here in the bottom Lane he's going to be able or in the top matchup I should say
4:24:23
but while he's in the bottom Lane he's catching a lot of these minions here um and I don't know like where Gio's going
4:24:31
to strike first in terms of trying to grab some early gold on the zigs because they got a Tempo Advantage but it hasn't
4:24:36
really led to putting him in a position to where he can like start uh using his passive to take turret plates off the or
4:24:42
anything like that this is not the same sort of snowb zigs we saw with successful Lane swaps last year true um
4:24:49
wol yeah do you think we're going to get a ruinous oton this game I'm leaning
4:24:54
towards no like if I had not the time yeah if I had to um pick where one of
4:25:00
the two would go this week out of the 10 uh 10 series I'm thinking this one isn't going to be it so far uh-huh in my
4:25:07
professional opinion all right I appreciate that I needed a professional opinion cuz I wasn't quite sure myself
4:25:12
uh King's moving back towards the top side looks like the dragon is going to be successfully secured here by uh the
4:25:19
DN freaks they are going to be able to grab that one next one going to be an infernal so the really cool Soul
4:25:25
percentage chance is quite low yeah but really cool individual Dres are
4:25:31
guaranteed indeed useful stats hey maybe if it in is end up being ruinous and they get those extra Buffs you know oh
4:25:38
true that'll be super relevant we got a lot of killing to go before then but who knows yeah well it is uh we're going to need
4:25:45
yeah 25 kills or something in the next 5 minutes uh probably not quite that much
4:25:51
that would be a lot or at least yeah maybe probably 30 actually like cuz I don't even know what the Damage Done
4:25:56
chart looks like right now but I imagine it's not great because I'm pretty sure it's like it's about like the amount of
4:26:02
fighting of any kind it's not necessarily just kills not 100% sure about how it uh really works but things
4:26:09
aren't great as now fer and Bulldog doing some battle between one another the that Q is not going to quite Find the Mark okay
4:26:17
um I I do think the damage Champions so far in this game has been quite low but
4:26:22
you can see gu is trying to shore some of that up a little bit here with some qes being lobbed in the general see one
4:26:28
of the bombs got blown up you know yeah beautiful um once again Bulldog
4:26:36
returning to Lane King in crashes a wave some minions lost but not so many that it makes a big difference here we're uh
4:26:43
you know trading mid lane waves here for 80 carries grubs grubs are up soon wolf
4:26:50
all right I don't think a is probably really unhappy about that speci I don't know what that one was trying to he's like trying to spot the ward like no it
4:26:56
doesn't show you the war yeah well land is at least there to try and add some protection so maybe we're not as upset
4:27:02
about the whole situation as P started this one up of course remember thean freaks do have themselves one of these
4:27:09
objectives already needing only a couple more so if they get all three of these grubs not only is that void M available
4:27:15
but that uh is another feet of strength which means that we're getting closer and closer to having feet which is and a
4:27:21
fight here comes kingan all right Bulldog making his way over on a flank angle that is an immediate cleanse from
4:27:27
Berserker but now he's got even more issues he does try and get himself out of the way but that is First Blood going
4:27:32
over to the zigs the Cyclones doing a whole bunch of work though as the akali's on the board lens with that
4:27:38
level six but into the back line goes doo lens still keeping himself alive but can dudo say the same thing the answer
4:27:44
is yes he was bailed out didn't even need it as Gideon's going to bite the dust and Bulldog sitting on two to start
4:27:51
this one off really huge play here for Bulldog picks up a ton of money already
4:27:57
was ahead of his counterpart in fer as Fisher's been kind of trying to clean up the map a little bit here but now it
4:28:03
finds himself over 1,000 gold the advantage and a lot of this fight was really decided by pik's fantastic ult
4:28:10
straight through the center of everybody lot of resources used on possibly going to do it again F has
4:28:16
to flash and Al and press every button that he has and he just teleported down there oh dear dudo is going to suffer
4:28:22
the same fate but he's going to die that is a solo kill for King and oh man we
4:28:28
getting World form King in here today it's looking like it I feel like is that our first solo kill of the whole day it
4:28:36
might have be there might have been a weird solo killer I mean in terms of like a laning early you know early yeah yeah yeah I it's our first sub 15
4:28:43
minutes Sol the kill 100% yeah well that's a nice trade back and they need it pretty desperately because it's a
4:28:48
collie that has its first item online super early sub 12 minutes good old sub
4:28:54
12 minute storm surge storm surge at at like 1135 or something like that is uh
4:29:00
quite powerful quite potent so in this fight Berserker is the Target right Gideon goes for the slide and grabs the
4:29:05
cleans K comes over here the kalista is out of the fight but Fisher actually unbinds a really awkward spot here and
4:29:12
the Cyclone is just hitting everybody in this one there's just no damage offered
4:29:17
back and then when we see the followup engage it is just a wash here oh man if Dudu was there just a little bit early
4:29:24
like life's hostile takeover was so good but if you had that public execution right over the top as it was coming
4:29:30
through yeah could have been so much better but still I mean Vegas can't be choose still a great fight here for DM
4:29:35
yeah dud looking kind of uncomfortable on this Champion so far this game really nice shock blast accelerated here by
4:29:41
kingan and just trying to clear the Wave Super far away from the turret there and King's like that's not allowed um I will
4:29:47
kill you and if he doesn't miss the shock blast he does so it's uh Cleaver by the way first okay so that's a lot
4:29:54
more damage I like that I'm into that I think you you're still allowed maybe what he was doing is like how much can I
4:30:00
snowball and still be relevant if I build a lot more damage or do I have to just try and play the weird sort of uh
4:30:07
tanky build um that we did see come out from Rich and we have seen quite a lot from solar Q recently yeah not entirely
4:30:14
sure see how it goes hosik is the Wukong here of course you do have a decent match up into the sichani we've spoken
4:30:20
about this many times before you get to shred a little bit uh and so you can try and get rid of her a little bit earlier
4:30:25
on but I think Gideon's probably still fine how this one's going especially with the Cs situation is now kingan
4:30:31
could be in trouble the Doo's revenge is Swift and it is dangerous um another Nim
4:30:38
strike does come in and dud dashing around will be a to pick up that kill so it takes them a little bit of time but they do manage to grab that kill in the
4:30:44
end yeah and there's no cross map available the fact that Bulldog is as ahead as he is means he just completely
4:30:50
controls Fisher in the side lane and even though there's a zigs in this game just really has not been getting damaged
4:30:57
onto the structures J unfortunately super unsuccessful in that regard as kingan just comes down here to set up a
4:31:03
ward in the river and is instantly punished by Yosi Cyclone comes out the nimus strike going to close the gap and
4:31:09
Dudu has just too many Dash Y and so that's that I mean as simple as
4:31:15
that you're coming up to see if you can catch him when he's trying to push forward push those advantages further he goes into the river and his Tombstone
4:31:22
was already etched at that moment when he dropped the W love that word etched just feels good I'll try to slide it in
4:31:29
when I can yeah yeah it's a great one absolutely all right Bulldog on a bit of a flank angle poosa gets into the pit
4:31:35
let's see whether he can steal this one away he's done these before but Gideon is going to be able to lock it down but now the perfect execution let's see
4:31:41
whether it's going to work he's straight into prison though not exactly optimal as it's going to be a cloud Soul oh baby
4:31:46
the excitement coming through from every angle but uh not in this team fight because in fact what really wasn't yeah
4:31:51
I mean bulldog Ed straight into an Ting Alis as Len just kind of walks it off it
4:31:57
was almost like a heist here um Gideon comes in secures the dragon and they just High tail it out of there there's
4:32:03
no punish to be seen and I get it for for Bulldog you want to hit any Target you can you want to get some value out
4:32:09
of your storm Razer early and uh not storm Razer um storm surge yeah storm
4:32:14
surge yeah one of those other stormies it's another it's a weather related item yeah um want to get as much value out of
4:32:21
it as you can and try to get something in that fight after you gave Dragon but he's unsuccessful good play from Nim
4:32:27
yeah this could be uh some feet of strength here for piosik he's able to
4:32:32
take this one down lens and Gideon wanted to do something about it but it is support jungle versus support jungle
4:32:38
with some shellfish in the middle boka going to come on over though and not exactly even this one out there is also
4:32:43
an essor up there so it looks like it is going to be that feet of strength being picked up by dnf so that's one a
4:32:50
piece only a turret remains between these two squads and I'm seeing a zigs yeah that's the thing that's really
4:32:56
scary but consider also that also aald yeah and there's a bottom turret that's very low because of the control Bulldogs
4:33:04
had in that bottom Lane so uh don't count those zigs eggs before they're
4:33:09
hatched those zigs satchels yeah don't count your bombs before they explode yes uh could be some Duds uh so far in terms
4:33:17
of damage to structure has been a bit of a dud for JE in this one even with the lane swap see he's dead even with the
4:33:23
kalista at this point in time and it's really the aalii that's the biggest problem for Nim when you look at the
4:33:30
Gold where that Herald goes though anybody's guess for now Wukong looking to head towards the bottom side of the
4:33:36
map and take out that weaken turret I mentioned uh before so what it looks like we're going to see yeah I actually
4:33:41
think that if he does just go down there race though yeah yeah this is this is really dangerous pios needs to get this
4:33:47
down no no no it's done yeah King is going to be out to take it the power of Jace will grab that first turret blood
4:33:53
and I think that's a blunder here for dnf I just I mean CU they had the herald yeah they had the herald so early at
4:33:59
least they're going to be able to get some damage onto this inner but that speeds the strength over the Noam great reaction from kingan he has demolished
4:34:06
he's Jace as you mentioned so he can press W and shoot real fast and that's exactly what he did and there was just
4:34:11
no answer there on the top side and the positioning of poos man he had to travel so far to set up the herald drop in
4:34:17
bottom Lane it wasn't an option mid because the mid turret's super healthy and there's a zigs with insane wave
4:34:23
clear that was in control there on top side didn't have control either so I think bot maybe they realized was their
4:34:28
best option a little bit too late had they been faster towards it perhaps they could have won out that race but yeah or
4:34:33
just throwing at Top Lane right uh kept kinging down uh as lens going to be out
4:34:39
to spot out pooshi gets that flash head about not exactly early enough though the warrior trick are going to come on
4:34:44
through and there's the handshake lens may just be dead here does heal trying to keep himself healthy The Bouncing
4:34:49
bombs and all of these minefields are real dangerous as the ulti not necessarily working Dudu dashing around
4:34:55
this fight they've got him right where they want him kinging going to be going down first as Bulldog diving forward
4:35:00
land's going to get Knocked Up In fact there's a triple the Hostile take over from Life on to everyone Fisher trying
4:35:07
to keep them into position but now it's Dudu looking to try and tidy this one and I think he's got the dashes to do it
4:35:13
at least the dashes to get towards the turret here Gideon going to be a to get away as is fer but it's a one fight for
4:35:20
dnf it's a huge win for dnf Berserker is trying to chase down fiser
4:35:26
here but isn't quite able to keep up with him at this stage in the game um perhaps with a few more of those Cloud
4:35:31
draks he'd have a better chance but either way is going to be able to crash his wave and will force a Teleport out
4:35:37
of fer does get back to get it well watch this old transpire here on the bottom lane or towards the bottom Lane
4:35:43
where lens actually wants to make a play here onto a Wukong just simply War trickst her away the followup just isn't
4:35:49
there it's quite a bizarre play here un really wanted to headbutt him back but something stopped him from being able to
4:35:54
get the right angle or something well even even if he does get the head butut the warrior trickster likely gets him out right and he had so it's just a
4:36:01
really bizarre call here for l a snap call to go for that one they didn't have enough control here they needed a lot more time and then the flash engage here
4:36:09
from life as you mentioned is just beautiful the Berserker comes over here and he's like if you guys want to stay
4:36:14
here and die be my guest uh and yeah L's Alis we've seen
4:36:21
the most incredible plays on him and sometimes you leave yourself a little bit head scratching face famine yeah it
4:36:28
is a bit of that oh it's voracious who would have thought as yeah
4:36:33
aon's been there for about 10 seconds see where the Nong shim are going to be starting this one up could be very dangerous and so fish is just going to
4:36:40
walk past and look for a minion wave won't be a to find it there's now a bulldog into some Mist here and Gideon
4:36:46
says I don't care he just gets himself out of the way understandable as well understandable have a nice day yeah um
4:36:53
I'm trying to figure out the ways in which Nim can start to win a team fight here because you know we talked about
4:37:01
how dnf need to snowball this game they've done a great job of it I mean I think this is about as ideal as it gets
4:37:07
I mean the aalii is massively ahead the ambessa was put behind early only slightly um and she still has two kills
4:37:14
like she's still very relevant in this game and they have been able to successfully set up really nice combos
4:37:19
with the Wukong with the ranata there's a lot of AOE here there's a lot of uh targets that are vulnerable like the
4:37:26
Jace in the backline who is going for the moram a second here um so he's not
4:37:31
going tank he's going to be very vulnerable like GI is he's a real Jace and neither of them have flash so some
4:37:37
things you have to consider enim really need to slow this game down somehow getting a dragon would certainly help yep Aon would also
4:37:45
help you could say especially for being able to get some of these Dives to happen it's interesting how we've seen
4:37:51
the Third Dragon sometimes go kind of unattended for a while because Aon is on the top side of the map really keeping
4:37:57
everybody kind of like on their toes like ooh do we really have enough time to take dragon and in this case I think they have enough information and um and
4:38:05
enough control over the top side where they actually can take the dragon then regroup here Noam just won't be able to
4:38:10
to take this fast enough at this stage of the game so they do their due diligence check it out set up Vision
4:38:16
then take the dragon and will now rotate back over D is trying to get a little bit of space here with this mid lane as
4:38:24
the ulti does come through bulldog looking to make his way up as life could be in trouble but instead they turn their attention towards the aalii who
4:38:32
going to be able to flash out of the way and oh no there's the mega Inferno bomb and it grabs two with the help of King
4:38:38
and shock blast it looked like he'd almost made the great uh The Great Escape but instead he was dead that is
4:38:45
going to be atakan taken here for Nong shim as well they got some Feats of Strength in their back pocket look like
4:38:51
they're on their heels in this game that is going to be a large amount of value that they'll be able to pick up although
4:38:57
they're not going to have their mid outter turret no certainly not I mean that's the consolation prize here for
4:39:03
dnf after this exchange but picking up Aon is going to feel nice it's not a composition that necessarily utilizes
4:39:09
the uh withdraw as well as some of the other comps but can give you some added safety and when you have the Yon you
4:39:15
know you're feeling like okay maybe this is my opportunity to really go in and make a big play here that was bizarre
4:39:21
yeah K actually teleported Top Lane instead of just backing you know he could have just said well I've got the
4:39:26
verious out of I don't care yeah he didn't want to waste it so this is you know a Fisher setting up a pick here and
4:39:33
the the team just faster to group punishing the fact that dnf were taking dragon on the other side of the map
4:39:39
bulldog with some cool plays here but ultimately just tosses his flash away and will end up dying anyways but that
4:39:45
was a really nice punish from Nim to set a trap there knowing that dnf were mostly on the other side of the map
4:39:51
setting up for Dragon so gets them the oton and let's see how to utilize this withdraw yeah it's working out quite
4:39:58
well so far at least for creating pressure around the map see whether they do do the thing where they'll just throw
4:40:04
their bodies underneath the turret to see whether they can get something as that is going to be a cyclone utilized fish are actually allowed to escape you
4:40:10
saw Yos move out of the way there um so not wanting to overly commit onto the Y
4:40:17
as there's a shuriken back flip I think he's going to have to take a bit of a recall here and there he goes so they
4:40:23
get rid of one of them yeah he does have teleport see if he wants to just head to
4:40:28
the Top Lane or if he's just 40 gold in a blood pedal in exchange for an out of turret W yeah not great um the trade
4:40:36
deal Mee oh wait two turrets actually yeah I receive
4:40:42
it's uh this deal keeps getting worse all the time Lando Lando got something to say about that man oh well this is
4:40:50
actually maybe three turrets Atlas well there's the glacial prison going wide let's see where the life can actually
4:40:55
find an angle here he just gets knocked up immediately but he's pretty tanky okay they're sending him all home it
4:41:01
looks like Gideon wants to go home as well he's like damn I'm so tanky but uh yeah they're all just going to go for a bit of a four turrets Atlas yeah um so
4:41:09
they throw themselves all at an inhibitor turret and uh successfully not
4:41:14
die but die yeah it's beautifully done it's a nice withdraw um Retreat uh after
4:41:21
killing three turrets now the inhibitor is open H is going to TP to the mid lane
4:41:27
oh leen's going to get the flash out of berserker has to invest his own as now Fisher looking for a bit of an angle of
4:41:32
kosi he's going to come down life not going to quite find it because fish is able to flash his way out of there has
4:41:38
dudo also dancing around this fight that hostile take over was not the one that life was looking for and pososi cannot
4:41:44
find the reset on the bailout and so he's going to hit the deck as well and
4:41:50
it's 25 and 1 half minutes that means The Baron's up and available and there is no jungler on dnf this is a bizarre
4:41:56
situation four teleports uh I believe in total committed to that mid lane fight
4:42:01
but Nim getting the jump on them having those set up first end up winning out
4:42:06
some low health bars means no Baron off the play but it's gu and Fisher who teleport here to kind of flank Berserker
4:42:13
and trap him sandwich him here in the mid lane and he's the first Target they find see Fisher's forced to then flash
4:42:20
here Bulldog shows up but there's not a great Target for this aalii and fosik is the one who actually ends up getting
4:42:26
punished here trying to keep Berserker alive and set him up to do that damage with the bailout he's almost able to get
4:42:31
something done there but not quite enough but does enough damage to her like I said the baron is denied a lot of
4:42:37
teleports are down but it doesn't necessarily look like it's going to matter in in this case is this game went
4:42:43
from having very little action to almost no time to breathe yeah um although 12
4:42:49
kills in 26 and 1/2 minutes isn't necessarily the most high octane League of Legends that we've seen but I'm glad
4:42:55
that it is at least picking up some Pace um I did like so I in the team fight was
4:43:01
like life's hostile takeover wasn't great in that moment I actually thought for the disengage upon the rewatch I
4:43:08
like unfortunately pios had already taken way too much damage and so it wasn't actually able to out so
4:43:13
I think I'm still definitely feeling good about the life R situation that we are seeing here I mean the tier three
4:43:20
boots have been done for J for a while he actually had top damage on the rift was shown just a moment ago the zigs was
4:43:26
a bit of a slow starter compared to a lot of the time what we've seen from zigs in the lck where he gets a ton of plates and or turrets early and is set
4:43:33
up that way he kind of has to build his own uh game this time around he's significantly behind in terms of Cs on
4:43:39
this kalista um but now with three kills actually takes a lead for the first time uh for Horizon Focus been done for a
4:43:46
while he is a big Mage uh big awesome dude and if he set up well here I mean
4:43:51
this is the scaling we've talked about for Nim super low range are dnf and you can teleport flank them you can trap
4:43:57
them you can set up a lot of scenarios where it's really uncomfortable for this kalista oh ulti going to come through here from fer really nicely picking out
4:44:05
Bulldog here even though he's in his shroud as that was a weird flash but it actually worked the sure back flip
4:44:11
keeping him alive for so long but there are a lot of bad guys in that area and it is going to be J that's able to lock
4:44:17
down that kill in the end I like the fancy footwork from Bulldog however he he still died so unfortunately it was
4:44:24
Port yeah second time for him unfortunately he's flashed to nearly live and then is killed by Bulldog a
4:44:31
moment later uh Bulldog now sorry not by Bulldog by jiu um du now has four kills
4:44:37
and they have their eyes on this bar the vision here they decide better of it as
4:44:43
Bulldog is respawning shortly I just feel like the location of the money is a
4:44:48
problem because J is well it's everywhere now he is the guy there it is also kind of everywhere you're right um
4:44:54
but the fact that suani doesn't have a big lead or something like that who cares yeah I mean it's it's a good point that you make though because earlier on
4:45:01
in the game it was a 1,100 I think which even got higher to like 1.4k lead for Bulldog he's now significantly behind
4:45:07
over this y he's been shut down really well they've done such a good job two levels behind they keep pulling him out
4:45:14
of these side Lanes uh which has been where he's found a lot of success where he put a lot of that pressure onto the bottom turret right and taking the col
4:45:22
off the map consistently really hurts her Spike that she had so early I mean she's just unfortunately not able to
4:45:27
make a big impact in this game anymore and now the Y is a big threat the zigs is fully online Shadow flame is done and
4:45:34
I mean n are just going come at me cuz you can't reach yeah and this is the problem that they were going to run into
4:45:41
right like the severe out ranging of nim is certainly a factor and dnf I think
4:45:46
they need to really hard commit on their opportunities if they can find them and
4:45:51
right now they haven't even been looking is what it feels like to me a lot of this game is going to come down to I
4:45:57
think for dnf now changing how they approach these fights cuz they've been trying to set up Berserker a lot he's on three items but I think they're going to
4:46:03
have to have a big flank from Dudu uh to really find success finding GI in the backline OR finding kingan is your best
4:46:10
path to success and I ideally je because he's really the one who's doing a majority of this damage he has flash right now though he has Satchel charge
4:46:16
he's just so difficult to lock down he's got lens as a bodyguard as well and I mean if you guys want to see how these
4:46:22
fights are going to work or potentially not work for dnf keep your eyes on Berserker on a lot of these team fights
4:46:27
see how many Autos he can actually get off it's not his fault or anything like that but he just is severely out ranged
4:46:33
and on three items as kalista when you have a massive lead you can do almost no wrong you just kind of run at them but
4:46:38
in this game where you're 1,000 gold behind the such a small Goldie but like you mentioned big Champions the zigs the
4:46:44
Yon online now the Jace has a ton of money where do you break through like what's the front line that you're
4:46:50
hitting you just can't quite reach by the time you're going in a lot of your front line is at half health because zigs has tossed a few bombs in and you
4:46:56
find yourself on the back foot we need pool base strategies the flanks have to be amazing or they catch Gideon out just
4:47:04
in the uh in the river but that doesn't actually happen Fisher going to be able to get himself back to his soul or body
4:47:11
that was Soul doing the fighting prior wasn't it yes uh but long I don't think are too
4:47:17
worried about how this game is going as far as scaling is concerned certainly doing wellish does take a little bit of
4:47:24
poke level 16 hit by Berserker here level 16 on J as well feels a whole lot worse um just with the fact that that
4:47:31
Mega Inferno bomb is going to be doing so much damage yeah especially with the items he's put together got an oblivion
4:47:36
orb now as well I do like that uh Tech from him a armu guard is picked up for
4:47:42
bulldog and with that armu guard setup I mean it might allow him to get into the back line a little bit better try to
4:47:48
kill J that's the game plan pios on the flank spotted yeah completely seen
4:47:54
that's going to be taken away fer is going to unbind the soul but as we know
4:47:59
uh P should so there we go they're just pushing the jungler out of the
4:48:05
area see life looking for an opportunity finds a handshake onto Gideon Berserker finally being able to actually do
4:48:10
something but unfortunately life can't quite get that fat call to go far enough and fer really needs like an extra
4:48:17
couple of teos on that Q to start hitting a few more of them and now bizer could take matters into his own hands I
4:48:22
don't know about this one however he is able to flash his way out the bail out's going to come on through does he have
4:48:28
the ren available he does not L gets a three-man knockup with that pulverize it's gorgeous and Nong shim now just
4:48:34
take the ad8 carry and they'll go about their merry way yeah remember in his interview earlier okay hold up life yeah
4:48:42
may just be not long for this world or perhaps with the cloud oh
4:48:47
oh Sentinel yeah he's on his team you in the interview earlier Berserker was like
4:48:53
I used to kind of make dumb aggressive moves but now I'm a smart player that did look a little bit like a tale of
4:48:59
frustration it it was it looked a little bit dumb at first but that's the kind of issue I was talking about you got to close the gap somehow he knows he has
4:49:05
bailout and I think that was the closest to a successful fight he was ever going to get he was like I'm taking this game into my hands and it almost was able to
4:49:12
to set them up a pick right it was fairly close but you can just see the problems of the composition in that
4:49:18
moment encapsulated his attempt there to to kind of just kamakazi his way through
4:49:24
but he is unsuccessful and that's a baron nor so watch this again like Berserker is just like okay he's going
4:49:29
to have to rebind I have an opportunity to Marshall pose off these minions here this is unfortunately the queue but when
4:49:35
this bailout comes through he's actually so close to getting this off on the
4:49:40
Gideon forces a flash out of him but I mean that that was about as good as we going to get everyone else is trying to fall up lens denies anyone getting in
4:49:48
there and bulock just can't hit anybody I mean it's a tank that was being hit there by Berserker so it's not like Bullock's going to go in there and blow
4:49:54
him up instantly it was too far away but I don't think it was the right call at the end of the day but you can see his
4:49:59
thought process there unfortunately just not successful and this composition has really reached its Twilight point I
4:50:05
think it's what it's kind of feeling like and Nim now with this Baron buff
4:50:11
now pressing down towards this inner turret on the bottom side inner on the top side of the map still up and available as well but it is a bare
4:50:18
inhibitor in the mid lanane so Nim can get two right here as Berserker taking
4:50:24
so much damage there's the glacial prison knockups are coming through though the Hostile takeover is so good and Berserker keeps himself alive they
4:50:31
take down the turet is now Dudu getting into that backline he flashes on top of CH that is so much money and Dudu may
4:50:37
have just saved it for the DN freaks King and going to be going down he cannot stand against five of them as
4:50:45
lens yeah headb p in his way to relative safety but he is the last man there kind
4:50:50
of like a mage blinking out of the dungeon he will survive but the rest of his team not there nope L will get away
4:50:58
and push that midwave but they weren't going to push to to hit mid they're now grouped on the bottom they want that inhibitor which is open and the play
4:51:06
here you know for Nim you you can see the concept of it right but unfortunately this ult doesn't really do
4:51:13
enough to Berserker by fer he's punished and taken out and then it's just a field day for dudo who's able to get to the
4:51:18
back line Satchel isn't enough he's able to flash on top of him and take out J and that's the damage gone here
4:51:25
completely as kingan can do little but look on alone as a Jace you need setup he did not have it his whole team fell
4:51:31
around uh him but that was a big big attempt from fer to get that backline
4:51:37
access to kill Berserker and to then follow up and win but a swing of gold as you can see as well the Red Bull Baron
4:51:43
power play for the DN freaks 2.2k not bad at all and they didn't even get the
4:51:50
baron so that is the turnaround and once again I want to bring up the fact that I think there's too many comeback
4:51:55
mechanics in this game of League of Legends W because it really did feel like Nong shim had a great game State no
4:52:01
I think this is fantastic what we've seen so far in both of our series is that it ain't over you still have to
4:52:06
play well in order to close these ones out absolutely and when come back to the range conversation
4:52:11
uh let's just say Nim especially fer um shortened the range between the T
4:52:17
Freaks and himself uh in that last play trying to make the aggressive uh setup
4:52:22
to grab an inhibitor if he gets that pick and they're successful with that play and G's bomb is more well timed
4:52:28
with him instead of being used so early maybe they're the ones walking away with an inhibitor at worst case scenario
4:52:33
perhaps even the win in the game itself but that overextension gives DM uh freaks a window back into this game
4:52:40
we're sitting at Cloud Soul point for them so that would be a huge Bo for them if they're able to get it especially
4:52:45
when you consider how well the Champions on their squad use it the ambessa that's always trying to close the gap the
4:52:51
Wukong that's going to be Ting and and running at you I mean it's actually incredible for this composition for them so if they could stick it out for 90
4:52:57
more seconds here they weren't able to get any Inhibitors off of that play but they delete the baron and they're in a
4:53:02
position now to where maybe they could get control maybe that cloud soul is enough to keep this composition relevant
4:53:09
for just a little bit longer I mean this is is our longest game of the day as well that we're approaching here 37 minutes and I think we've got a little
4:53:15
bit left to go and alost one was like really really long as well um but I think it was over in another 5 minutes
4:53:22
or something like that and we were heading towards like Baron number three and elders and things like this it was absolutely obscene and so now we're
4:53:29
still waiting on a soul 50 seconds until that cloud is going to be up and available DN freaks if they do get that
4:53:35
I think it really does spell a big turn right that extra movement speed like this whole composition is built around
4:53:41
kill J get on top of him and kill him and if you move faster you can do that faster and just completed his merel
4:53:50
Amicon so doesn't have a death cap but that'll be the last step if he does finish his build here right now holding
4:53:56
on to that control W in that last spot as vision is going to be so critical you can see every inventory is has got one
4:54:01
basically a few exceptions here life in trouble yeah could be although it does
4:54:06
look like he's posturing aggressively you can kind of feel it the bouncing bomb doing a little bit here as King in
4:54:13
also off to the side really wanting to create a fish in a barrel scenario man how did no one get hit by that kind of
4:54:19
crazy Berserker going in again all right King could be in trouble me Inferno not really doing too much as they take down
4:54:25
the Jace D just trying to get himself alive Bulldog diving into the back line as well the flash on top of the zigs and
4:54:31
the main man is down it's now Fisher that's in trouble as he has created enough space to knockups are good from
4:54:37
lens but they've lost all the damage and Berserker is still on full health
4:54:43
this guy's a Madman as Bulldog get on in there he should be able to take down fer here finding the fivepoint strikes and
4:54:49
unfortunately that Soul has to rebind even goes golden to get the style points bazer is going to grab himself a cloud
4:54:55
soul and this game is back around again yeah now there's no wav set up here for them to just rush down and start pushing
4:55:02
to to end the game or even to threaten an inhibitor just yet 50 seconds on fer though means that they will be
4:55:08
definitely looking for that as soon as they grab this bear and they grab grab Cloud Soul we talked about how important that is with the movement speed the
4:55:13
baron will allow them to even though they don't have great Siege and great range do a lot with this now this is another exact same situation what preser
4:55:20
did last time and if you're looking at that last fight going man this guy is is crazy like he's lost his mind like what
4:55:26
is he doing you can see how it works in a practical situation here where Wukong also helps him peel or helps peel for
4:55:32
him as he kind of tights towards the rest of the team he has no fear he knows how kalista works and when he's got a
4:55:38
rata attached to him and he's got this many items he just can do almost no wrong yeah that's bar it's so
4:55:45
beautifully done because there was no counterplay to that just none at all and he identified the fact that if we get
4:55:51
kingan on his own he's got Jack I've got I've got all of my things you will die even if you try and kill me I'll get
4:55:57
bailed out and you'll be dead he's super smart and this build is creative and maybe he was right I I really just think
4:56:04
like I gave him credit for like what what we thought maybe could work in the last fight but you can see in practice
4:56:10
here and I think people who were calling him out after the last one probably pretty quiet right now yeah I know I I I
4:56:16
love it because it's like this is what I meant by the way guys so we get the the confirmation that yeah know this is actually how this one works and I mean
4:56:24
he's he's had a a really high impact game here and he's never been afraid his
4:56:29
positioning has been aggressive and the man is just making waves in this one and now again this composition has a second
4:56:35
or third or maybe is it fourth now least on life at least um and with the baron buff they need to
4:56:42
crack the Inhibitors though they need to utilize this Baron buff to get this base open cuz they might not get another
4:56:47
chance at this well let's see how this one goes as life is going to join Berserker once again he's just buffing
4:56:53
up these minions sending them towards these turrets kingan finishes hole breaker so it's looking to be a bit of a
4:56:59
side lane threat himself yeah Gideon has got a large Helper but they seem to be getting through it as Fisher looking for
4:57:06
an opportunity but he's going to have to rebind so he does get back there a lot of pings towards do they they just not
4:57:12
they're not getting the inhibitor I mean they really need it so badly to set up this elder fight okay maybe there's a
4:57:17
chance here now on the bottom Lane but the team is not set up for this yeah still one and a half minutes as the ulti
4:57:23
comes through from fer but he's not able to lock onto Berserker here gets out of the way I don't know if
4:57:28
they're going to get it I mean they're going to get this mid turret at least that's gold but more than gold they need Super minions here I feel it's not
4:57:35
impossible to win if they don't get one but it would be so huge for them if they could secure it
4:57:40
yeah I think that like being able to break up the Nim composition right like so that they can't just bear down on you
4:57:46
with all their range I agree with you still I think that the amount of power
4:57:51
wrestled back here by DN dnf has been so good and they have the cloud Soul so triple cloud like they are running real
4:57:58
quick yeah Gio's wave clear is really making this so much easier for Nim to deal with and you know you can see he's
4:58:05
actually opting for void staff here as his final item rather than death death cap just because of the tankiness that
4:58:12
started to kind of acre here we are in Supreme Lake game right now so I think it's a wise choice you can see Berserker
4:58:17
is actually almost matched him a damage on a kalista that could barely reach that's insane uh I I I look at this
4:58:23
situation now as this game is probably going to come down to whether or not dnf can set up a fight and kill J or
4:58:30
Berserker can find that angle and get empowered once again to just blow up the front line while pososi keeps the other
4:58:36
players at Bay just like they did in that last dragon fight cuz it's it's it's not impossible by any means but Nim
4:58:42
the the scary part of this late game the first real scary part is over they weathered the storm they didn't lose any
4:58:47
inhibitor turrets even so it's an honest 5v5 yeah straight up yep and if they win
4:58:54
it they get Baron as well and so I mean it's likely game off the back of this
4:58:59
next team fight it's about how decisive dnf are going to be is Berserker going to be able to find that angle yet again
4:59:05
because he's got two extra lives he's got bailout and he's got G yeah
4:59:10
you lose a lot of steam when the ga is activated of course because you're in stasis and your team needs that damage
4:59:17
in that moment but there's a world where it could actually be super huge for him oh yeah um especially with how CH this
4:59:23
game has been the way the damage threats work for no shim I think for Nim ideally you want to be landing some poke before
4:59:29
Berserker gets anywhere near you you want to be utilizing that range of Edge and they are just going to hard camp
4:59:35
this elder early look at all the vision they're setting up they're trying to set up traps here and get every every single entry point set this opens up an
4:59:42
opportunity for dnf to try to S Side Lane here but kind of seen it every turn yeah I like Dudu heading up there and
4:59:49
threatening this side lane going to be able to probably take this one down he's got AIT bit of damage but instead going
4:59:56
to respect the fact that Nim could be lying in weight this game is so interesting because mean the drafts we talked about it from you know second one
5:00:03
of the game how they're so different and how they do totally different things but in this situation dnf they have you know
5:00:10
some sideling threats but it's not enough to go over and actually threaten an inhibitor after that Baron is gone
5:00:15
and that's why I was really harping on I really think they need to get this inhibitor now because no are like M you
5:00:21
could silent but you won't you know you could threaten my inhibitor but you won't we have two TS and we're just
5:00:26
going to set up a vision at every single entry point to this dragon Elder dragon's up in 38 seconds they're just
5:00:32
going to Camp it and say eventually you have to come to us you can't shoot far 7,000 more item value on the side of dnf
5:00:38
fresh off a back n haven't quite gone for a reset yet there is 27 seconds on the clock I don't think
5:00:44
they're going to be able to I think they just really want to have PR more than anything else yeah makes sense well the
5:00:50
hand's looking for a little bit of an angle here we'll see whether they do find anyone as pososi Creeps in to the brush o Berserker getting dangerously
5:00:57
close to kalista Auto Range Champions yeah banana brush so important here as
5:01:03
fer is going to unbind to the soul doesn't pull the trigger on an ulti or anything like that we've still got Flash's Galore across the rift and the
5:01:10
Elder is on the map all right there's the flash Cyclone right on top of jiu he's going to have to flash to get himself out of there now Gideon all on
5:01:17
his Lonesome but uh he's real tanky going to be able to survive at least for now 2K damage here for Berserker to
5:01:23
start this one off and they've started the Elder do having blue buff here from that Global blue is actually super huge
5:01:29
for him as well look at this from Bulldog this is real scary they've turned on him immediately he can go into
5:01:34
the Shroud but he's almost just dead but into the back line goes dooo he's headbutted out of there but everyone is
5:01:41
just piling on top the Hostile take over doesn't do enough but it does something
5:01:46
and dnf are just going to be flashing after them King and looking to go down and we thought that this was in the bag
5:01:52
for Nong shim and dnf said now hold my bail out we're going to kill you all
5:01:59
everything put into G there and it looked like maybe he was going to be punishing Bulldog but he steps One Step
5:02:06
too far forward he's the one who goes down zerker says I've lost interest in
5:02:11
killing Champions I'm killing the Elder yep and Dudu is just yeah going to be uh trying to take them down in their base
5:02:19
and that is going to be successful first inhibitor going to go down the inhibitor turret and the Nexus turret's going to
5:02:24
be following this dragon is angry and it's hungry and it's not going to be eating more for dinner tonight said it's
5:02:30
going to have to settle for an Nexus and a couple of turrets dnf man what a slobber knocker of a game
5:02:38
and they are going to be the victors here in just game one this was just game one I think this has been the best game
5:02:44
of the tournament so far in terms of entertainment value and the sample size is so much higher than if you had have said that in a previous series if I said
5:02:51
it after game two or three it would have been like w I mean I don't know but we've had some really one-sided games
5:02:58
and our last two have been very close but this was close in a very unique way I think dnf showcasing how smart they
5:03:04
are and how the the flank potential they have with this aalii with this ambessa
5:03:10
the amount of threats for the zigs you have to be able to find that angle you have to be able to have the punish and
5:03:16
it looked for just a split second like maybe bulog had made an error maybe he went too far maybe he actually try
5:03:21
trying to kill J just lost his team the game but his his teammates are ready to follow up and GI was obliterated once he
5:03:28
was gone Berserker didn't even think twice he's like I'm just killing the Elder game this one and uh bker tops the
5:03:35
damage overig he out damages a zig in a 46 minute game take my player of the
5:03:40
match Berserker that was pretty unbelievable this guy keeping himself relevant in one of our longest games of
5:03:46
the season so far and 46 minutes is longer than I was expecting I thought we were going to have like quick fire games
5:03:52
with all of these extra objectives that we have available the fact that things were looking like they were heading in a
5:03:58
snowbally direction this was back and forth and back and forth and thankfully
5:04:03
we've got another one on the table we're not going to see any of these Champions no more of the Berserker kalista this time around um um but man I just want I
5:04:11
want more of that Vibe right it doesn't necessarily have to be the same Champs the same drops just give me those vibes
5:04:17
and I'm so happy time for us to go to a short break when we get back the space going to be breaking that one down and
5:04:23
we will see you for game number two

5:12:00
after that last match the lck is truly back it was a slobber knocker Affair but
5:12:06
the DN freaks get their first Victory on under their new name and are up 1 Z over
5:12:11
Nim red Force welcome back to the space Deon alongside Chronicle noox to break that one down and Ox is Ox is going to
5:12:19
take up a lot of the segment I'm just letting you guys know it's going to happen but you it'll make sense in just
5:12:26
a little bit yeah it will uh if if you've watched the LSK before and you saw that zigel pick you kind of had a
5:12:31
feeling this was coming uh and he told us about 20 minutes in no guys it's overdone I don't want to do a zig
5:12:38
segment I I think you know we've done it too many times but then we got so mad that we're still going to do it but
5:12:43
first let's take a look at some of the other team fights uh because I we don't want to go too crazy on him just yet
5:12:49
because started out very well Nim showing again that OT is insane right
5:12:57
and yes there's a small gold lead here I want you to see what this one buff allows you to do and particularly when
5:13:03
you have a composition with strong s laner like y you have a zigs as well the
5:13:08
tower Tak potentially is huge and the response to a team pushing in Siege and like you have to fight them you don't
5:13:14
want to be fighting against this buff though and they they want to been able to defend their base But ultimately you
5:13:19
don't really gain much other than stop on the push meanwhile Y is pushing in the S Side Lane uh and the cost is just
5:13:25
so much in terms of structures so that's four turrets off of that single play and
5:13:31
in theory I think you look at the composition that was there for DN Freaks and it doesn't necessarily skill poorly
5:13:38
but there's a kalista which is very short range which we saw berser will be able to navigate and then the rest is very uh you need to basically get it
5:13:44
done on your first play when you go in which fortunately for them they were able to because if you don't get top of
5:13:50
that zigs in the long term I think you are going to end up losing out on those fights so that was Four Towers in that
5:13:55
one play this is our fourth match and how many uh ruus aons have we seen
5:14:01
Ox uh we've seen oh H non runas for vicious that's right not going to zero
5:14:09
zero of them Here's the final fight here 45 minutes on in we get to late game this is where Z supposed to do a lot of
5:14:14
damage kalista short range it should be difficult to get in yeah I want you to watch so J look at the aali so they they
5:14:20
decided to try and make a pick on the aali and we we'll watch just track the abilities that g throws this this is
5:14:26
really important to take into account for any zigs players any aspiring zigs players um coming in a second so look
5:14:32
for him the Q goes the E goes that's fine oh the W and you're dead literally like a second later just you know how
5:14:39
how much damage did that W do to aari not much immediately you die and you
5:14:44
know some people might think oh well this is a really hard comp to play into for zigs and I'm going to be honest it's
5:14:49
not that hard It's tricky at times but you outrange everything and your W is such a good safety tool do you know what
5:14:55
happens if a Cari Dives towards you you put the W between you and Ai and you're a mile away afterwards and I was like ox
5:15:02
what if we focus on doooo he had a wonderful game multiple great catches actually think did a really good job us
5:15:09
even more so than yuk who I think had a couple really pop of moments every single fight I think dud was on point with his ultimate absorbing a ton of
5:15:16
pressure uh but as as he naturally does um and and again I want to go back to
5:15:21
the point in time where we thought that we could talk more about other stuff because everything looked so good look
5:15:28
at this bomba Ox you're feeling great this was a point in time where I was happy you know I mean this is what every
5:15:34
zigs player wants th this is this is a fantasy when it comes in you syn up with a teammate
5:15:40
woo now I was a happier man then and and this was the point where I was like no guys we can talk about other stuff uh
5:15:47
and then when we got to the end of the game yeah cuz it was at this point Dan
5:15:53
where you're like you know his build isn't optimal but it's good it's good but not optimal and now time to talk
5:16:00
about it right I said okay like he what's what's wrong with this what isn't you know what it's actually he he ended
5:16:06
up building Moran Amicon it's missing the most egregious part he finished morom before he had void staff where's
5:16:12
the rabbit you never had a rabbit on right if you go LeAndre you try best Wukong even kalista built like a jack
5:16:18
show like the Andre just eclipses every other item like it beats Shadow flame for damage it beats Horizon Focus for
5:16:24
damage you need LeAndre is broken you should have built that but the void stuff came in after romicon and people were like oh zigs does no damage look he
5:16:31
can't that yeah cuz you built terribly that's how it's so e it's also I did go
5:16:36
a presence of mind which he was also uh he didn't even remember to mention but uh it was a personal issue Berserker did
5:16:45
play well his first game back in the lck But Here We Go game number two DN freaks
5:16:50
looking to try and get the win here will they be able to do it let's find out as we send it back on over to Atlas and
5:16:59
wolf thank you so much gentlemen and I am very sorry or we tried to ignore it
5:17:05
as much as possible uh here while we were casting because we knew our whole lot of time was going to be spent on
5:17:11
dissecting how that zigs managed to lose that game and I'm really glad that we did get to the bottom of it and that's
5:17:18
great to know I'm a big proponent of building LeAndre I was okay with getting the void staff but there wasn't a death
5:17:26
cap there wasn't a LeAndre and the I think part of we talked about Berserker
5:17:32
outdamage to zigs but as was pointed out and we didn't touch on it too much in game uh was really just the build um
5:17:38
limiting his damage the Satchel usage was a bit questionable throughout and Jew's had some good zigs games uh the
5:17:44
last year but this this was not our favorite and look early year Jitters potentially um and I don't want to take
5:17:51
anything away from DN freaks either because they had a pretty heroic uh win in this one nice comeback from them and
5:17:58
kind of Against All Odds we're able to despite a range disadvantage win uh and
5:18:03
I think a lot of that based on the plays we saw from Dudu a lot of it from Berserker you know being completely
5:18:10
Fearless in his kalista play and I'm just looking forward to more to be honest and luckily that's what we got
5:18:16
coming up exactly we've got game number two it is on the horizon and we'll see who's going to be
5:18:21
able to take it here because of course no more zigs we don't need to worry about that uh because this is fearless
5:18:27
baby and we just don't even need to worry few of the Bands might be getting looked at as well of course we did have
5:18:34
the auroras taken away the V the Scana the gante uh naus leono two of uh lens's favorite
5:18:41
Champions were banned in the second round if he does get his support logged in earlier on then maybe it's going to be a better experience for them but it
5:18:48
did feel like in that first first game the both teams got the archetypes that they were looking for right we saw it
5:18:54
the very beginning kalista and Bessa and the rata all locked in th that's a
5:18:59
phenomenal core as far as creating a short range brawling composition and then the zigs Yon sajwani like they were
5:19:06
saying lot of s Side Lane power and then that range that the zigs provides and the wave clear if that side laning is
5:19:11
something you're going to play through now we'll just have to see whether we're going to get similarly uh well-crafted
5:19:17
drafts moving into this game whether it once again just devolves into crazy
5:19:23
chaos that's the big question picks like the scarner the Cante still incredibly
5:19:28
relevant here uh Ash and varis also not seen in that last game so both available
5:19:36
until potentially banned in this first first ban phase poppy taken off the
5:19:41
board one more time so we're definitely going to see a different look than di versus poke in this second game no bread
5:19:50
Force have first pick so if they decide to say they want the ash or the varis
5:19:55
they just leave both open here in the final ban they'll ban the Jacks and they get to choose and this may mean that we
5:20:01
see Dean freaks similarly leave both open as well yeah the Jack span is kind
5:20:06
of curious means that leaving a lot available aora I think probably needs to be looked at right yeah the cassant also
5:20:12
a big one the Aurora it would be the most logical if you want to trade ad carries
5:20:18
here and uh corki once again will be taken away here from fiser fer has I
5:20:24
mean he practically was a Corky one trick all year last year oh man Cante going to be prioritized over Aurora and
5:20:32
I think it makes it an easy call to go Aurora in return here for Bulldog Bulldog has yeah he debuted the Aurora
5:20:37
in the lck right yeah and he's he's the kind of player that you're not you know when you see the aalii get locked in for
5:20:43
him you're usually thinking like okay that's a little bit out of your wheelhouse it's not that you can't do it but it's not your normal he was great at
5:20:49
Tristana was famous for it but was mostly a scaling Mage player Aurora kind of fits ail and knock turns up oh God
5:20:56
they could just lock in both of them well the nocturn is going to be the first lock in and I imagine Aurora comes
5:21:01
in after that and it's the first time we're going to see the combination utilized here in the lck cup as first
5:21:07
piosik does need h of weird stuff before he does eventually lock that one down there is his namesake um two junglers
5:21:15
and they do it the only other pick you'd want to get would be like an Oriana here but then you just give the Aurora over
5:21:20
so it just doesn't make any sense there's there's no other option here that's what we're going to see and uh
5:21:26
now things get a little bit more interesting here in terms of what we going to see fer play we could see an AP
5:21:34
jungle for Gideon and he could play ad here try to duel with this um with this Aurora or he can just lock
5:21:42
in the Victor this would be a completely weird look for Fisher cuz he's not usually the the scaling Mage
5:21:49
player type at least not here in the lck he's an a fury player yeah he likes to
5:21:55
play ad Champions most of the time well it's probably not going to be
5:22:00
nly don't mind the uh the maai but zenzo feels good and that is going to be the
5:22:07
lock in here a lot of brawling power with the Zin and the Cante means they can create a bit of a wall in front of
5:22:14
the uh the Victor as well feel a little bit better about than the Victor Jace shenanigans that we saw in our previous
5:22:20
uh series it's a really nice uh front line for a scaling mid laner later on in
5:22:26
terms of damage or it's just going to be Aurora top and you have Aurora nocturn and Oriana nocturn oh god well that's a
5:22:34
lot of combo not a lot of tanking um so the DM freaks really opting in for well
5:22:41
we don't need front line if they're all dead which you know I guess we can't
5:22:46
fault that the Ezreal band makes a lot of sense here because of you know the fact that basically what you want now as
5:22:54
n red force is a very safe Ed carrier that can do damage from very far away so that you can avoid getting collapsed on
5:23:01
by this incredibly strong set of combos that we could see here for DN freaks we'll see what else they want to ban
5:23:06
here um cuz Ezreal is the the safest pick that fits the bill and everything
5:23:12
here and I don't think you're looking for an ash in this situation uh just doesn't really make sense I mean unless
5:23:18
you're really looking to control level one but you don't know what your opponent's bottom Duo is just yet they'll ban it anyways cuz it's still
5:23:24
incredibly strong and it leaves it open for potentially game three yep and uh then the Varys is probably the answering
5:23:30
ban you could say it feels like it's sticking out like a sore thumb was banned very early on in fact in our
5:23:36
previous game it's I mean both of these bottom Duos can play anything weird and
5:23:41
crazy so you know we're thinned out in terms of 80 carries quite substantially but I like this it's perfect for the
5:23:48
comp we are diving yeah and now like with the poppy band away as well
5:23:53
absolutely genius there's nowhere to pick up something like AA to try and stop this Killer Instinct from going
5:24:00
exactly where Berserker wants it to and like Leona is up I imagine Leona for
5:24:05
life in this situation yeah imagine playing Lucian in 2025 well uh you may
5:24:12
make that dream a reality wolf I would not advise oh no I I give me back the
5:24:17
Lucian I want the Lucian back oh no well I think we might have two upsets today Atlas yeah um like we have already
5:24:26
explain we have seen Z is bad into into multiple dive
5:24:31
threats we already explained it on the space why weren't they watching they were sitting there they were sitting
5:24:36
there getting ready for the games I thought they'd be watching the global desk and look so theoretically you can
5:24:43
feather storm the you know paranoia shock wave combo so if it's just the nocturn and
5:24:50
Ariana it's genius as it turns out though there there seem to be a few other Champions though on the oh don't
5:24:56
complicate things wolf how dare you that is going to be life locking in the ra
5:25:01
and I love that uh Dean freaks didn't opt into going for I mean they they
5:25:08
could have gone for the Leona which would have been great into the raon also but they didn't opt to go for for anything super like standard in terms of
5:25:16
like just going all right well we got the Aurora we'll just get a top laner they double down they hyper index just
5:25:22
like they did in game one into their play style this is what I'm hoping to see for teams that we expect to be in
5:25:27
the rise group right going into the lck is just really leaning into your identity they're doing it already here
5:25:32
in Fearless draft on day one of the lck cup and that's exciting to see we already really know the type of team
5:25:38
that D freaks are oh yeah and we might even have one more game in this series to to really learn more but they know
5:25:43
the type of team they know that they know their identity they know what they want to do what they're good at what they've been able to accomplish early on
5:25:50
in this year in scrims and uh you just love to see teams that are like that hey that's where from he's from where you're
5:25:55
from hey that's where I'm from and I haven't been to Perth in a really long time so
5:26:00
welcome how's it going man hope you're having a great time here at low Park and
5:26:06
I hope perth's doing well as well it's been like so many years I went there for like one event called Supernova like
5:26:12
back in 2013 or something like that but that is enough story time it is time to get into this game number two nongshim
5:26:19
red force with their newly upgraded roster with kangan in the Top Lane in l h on the bottom side of the map can they
5:26:26
keep their dreams alive in the series let's find out
5:26:38
[Applause] all right here we are ladies and gentlemen onto the rift to see whether
5:26:45
the DM freaks are going to be able to pick up a victory or whether it is going to be
5:26:51
Nong shim holding on to this series bringing us to a six gamer on our very
5:26:56
first day the most League of Legends possible would be absolutely what we're
5:27:01
looking for I don't know I feel like dnf been real good today they really have
5:27:07
this draft might be like we might look back at this draft and be like Wow first
5:27:13
pick Cante really wasn't the play um I mean I'm I I looked at it when it
5:27:18
happened and was like it's not feeling like well at the time it seemed kind of less than ideal right but when the draft
5:27:25
finished you're like oo I mean they really got everything um like this draft
5:27:30
has so much power packed into it and everything works together like clockwork ah clock I get it cuz of Ariana I like
5:27:37
that yeah uh it all winds up as Berserker and life going to go a little bit aggressive here
5:27:43
against the classic Kaiser matchup and that is the Zia uh as the crash down comes out
5:27:50
immediately H taking a little bit of damage here as life utilizing that aftershot quite nicely the feather pole
5:27:55
not going to come in just yet that is of course not what you take level one life is known to put his abilities on cool
5:28:02
down uh at level one when his enemies are in range of them regardless of what he's playing I like that as well I mean
5:28:08
maximizing the value he should have flashed though and ignited he's already at full Mana you know like he didn't
5:28:15
even lose anything from that I mean where's our stat for like flashes per game and like ignites per game I think
5:28:21
that that stat really needs to be celebrated more it could maybe that that's the stat that Barrel could almost
5:28:26
always it's honestly a pretty interesting stat though when you consider that like you know a player who
5:28:32
might have very little flash usage could tell you a lot of different things about a lot of different people um yeah like
5:28:37
they need to flash cuz they're so good or like they often go like ghost ignite uh y yep yep y uh we'll uh we'll have to
5:28:47
keep asking for that one maybe next year yeah maybe it's Summoner spells per game maybe that's a that's a better
5:28:52
one uh all right dissonance not going to be really doing too much here to Fisher and both of our mid laners are staying
5:28:59
relatively low of course this used to be a very popular Lane match up it's now being kind of overshadowed by the Corky
5:29:05
aers of the world but it used to be Victa Oriana every game you know a lot
5:29:10
of CC's been added to the game since this matchup was really really um the
5:29:16
quite dull extremely common one and I feel like people still haven't realized that the Zia ult can only get you really
5:29:22
out of one you know ax gave me credit for complaining about picking Zia into kenon
5:29:29
because the ult still on the ground kind of same thing with Aurora yeah um and
5:29:34
a well the fact that you can just get the feather storm by pressing paranoia
5:29:40
is like another thing as well so I feel like you just kind of have to as Fisher might just be dead here Bulldog is going
5:29:46
to be able to get the flash at least command protect going to keep him alive as those minions got angry and he had
5:29:52
just enough Mana to do so Yos not even really needed here I think he threw out a dustbringer but that was about it yeah
5:30:00
going to be too significant cuz they're both just going to teleport back to Lane yeah but wait I was told that this is
5:30:05
why we had to change teleport cuz it just lets players just go back to Lane for free there's no way they'll still do
5:30:12
that well it turns out they did just Bulldog had ignite he'd be dead
5:30:20
at all right well um they are still going to be fighting
5:30:26
you can see the uh death raid doing some stuff here from Fisher yeah this this early game has
5:30:32
been pretty uh timid let's look at Top Lane more let's let's see some gr Ru aon's coming out this game wolf we're
5:30:39
charging up for it look at him stacking it up hey they are fighting a lot yeah King's just he's like I'm Cante come at
5:30:45
me keep hitting me I've got a a mantle uh we want gray attic man this time
5:30:54
please it's probably not happening and it's not happening it's like already confirmed not happening yeah
5:31:00
yeah I've committed to being disappointed in my brain but maybe if Cante takes like about a million damage
5:31:06
Lane harassment it could happen that's a lot of action that is a lot of damage how many times would you die taking a
5:31:12
million damage I mean I guess you could do the calculation couldn't you but we're not going to math on streams always always
5:31:17
dangerous Gideon going to push forward finds piosik piosik finds him now just going back
5:31:24
away there's not a lot of health bar here in this mid lane maybe that means that we're we're going to get get to the
5:31:30
ruinous boy the H coming up here Bulldog doesn't have teleport this could be I
5:31:36
mean with the teleport coming in here from dooo maybe we are going to fight but going to say maybe we're looking for
5:31:41
a bit of a later First Blood situation again yeah this is a heck of a rotation really making sure that they can uh grab
5:31:48
these grubs up in 15 seconds B be a to take that one away he is just hanging
5:31:53
out bottom Lane kingan's going to catch the wave doesn't have TP um that won't
5:31:59
do it no not quite reaching life just continues trotting
5:32:05
by and uh with I mean it's a big investment as Kos going to be able to
5:32:10
take the first grub so no Feats of Strength going to be taken down here and he can just flash out of the way if he'd
5:32:16
like to instead he decides to just go in and that seems like a good idea because Fisher is in a whole host of trouble
5:32:22
Bulldog going to be able to throw down the command distance and picks up the kill with a commander attack they take down the knockturn in the end as Gideon
5:32:28
has to flash to get himself out of the way and jiu's made his way in three versus three now but the ulti comes
5:32:35
through from Dudu gets the flash out from jiu there as well well and man it is chaos but it's working out uh for dnf
5:32:42
yeah in terms of flashes feels like a trade up here for dnf they're also able to get a kill on Oriana versus a kill
5:32:49
onto the uh shinha now they do end up getting a feet of strength even though they weren't able to get three grubs
5:32:55
because they got first Blood yes First Blood did come in yeah so that that's you know a big win here for dnf uh we're
5:33:02
hoping to get that plus the three unable to do so this fight is really Scrappy like dudo is not even here initially cuz
5:33:08
he's trying to clear this wave to get an extra Advantage there he gets six he comes down here and fer basically dies
5:33:15
instantly but Gideon gets a ton of work done to a nocturn that just isn't really able to fight that well early and spend
5:33:21
a lot of his resources helping to kill um that Victor so bit of a weird fight
5:33:26
there but ultimately still a big win for dnf because they got the more more grubs more flashes and also that first Fus
5:33:33
strength with the first blood and a kill onto Oriana I would say more valuable than onto the shinel yeah definitely and
5:33:39
a possible five grubs available if they're able to get that feed of strength by the next round of grubs it does come in Cloud Drake up and
5:33:46
available here for either team they are going to be able to get enough people down here to look for it looks like it
5:33:52
is not really a big Focus right now so we've just got bottom Lanes meeting up once again Berserker holding on to this
5:33:58
wave and we are just probably going to go back into a bit of a a l State once again for now
5:34:05
yeah we've been kind of lacking on the little States far a lot of aggression
5:34:11
yeah I'm kind of like I was a little bit scared I'm like well but that's our whole lck thing like how can how could people be like oh the LC casters are so
5:34:17
fun if we just don't get to have fun um yeah we're too busy like talking about the game yeah like the game and like all
5:34:23
the exciting action I'm like wait when will we get to talk about jrpgs and stuff and it was it was crazy as well
5:34:29
cuz I was really worried that we weren't necessarily going to get so much action cuz I was watching the LPL and it was like not exactly the most high octane
5:34:36
League of Legends that I had seen over the last couple of days as there's the shock wave combination but the
5:34:42
gravity field is in good position now chaos storm trade going to come on through there and Fisher doesn't even
5:34:47
need to use his flash so yes piosik and Bulldog managed to nail the combo and no
5:34:53
it didn't really do anything yeah I mean it gives Bulldog a little bit of a Health Advantage in Lane but that
5:34:59
probably won't necessarily translate anything and pik's ult is now down um whereas Gideon has his so perhaps
5:35:04
there's a world where no shim are able to use this timing to try to pressure on the dragon while Berserker is pushed in
5:35:10
looks like that's exactly what's going to happen so while it may have been an opportunity for Bulldog to try to push
5:35:15
further advantages it's ultimately going to be the first objective full objective that is to say going over to Noam still
5:35:22
have one3 of the spe spring off of this attempted play in the mid lane but otherwise it's still very quiet game
5:35:28
with not a lot of action it was like very uh short amount of action but no death and then it was just back to Tak
5:35:35
effect chilling yep lot of vision uh there for Nong shim as well DF not
5:35:40
really too many opportunities to try and counteract that so credit going to Nong shim there they had a plan they executed
5:35:47
and they get the reward so nicely done grabing grabbing themselves third of a fet of strength and getting themselves a
5:35:52
little bit closer to a uh hopefully infernal Soul um because then we' get
5:35:58
some Earth Wind and Fire which I think is a nice way um you know to continue this series
5:36:03
sure I mean everybody loves that yeah how do you feel about the new teleport
5:36:09
do you like the sort of like gliding on in there um there's some things I like about it I think it looks very fun uh
5:36:15
it's it's hard to get used to the timing like sometimes I I'm like oh I I need to go in now I need to wait a little bit
5:36:20
longer to get my like full health before I TP and then I'm just like sitting there cuz it takes so long I'm like oh I should have tpd a second earlier I like
5:36:27
that you can teleport to Wards again and and minions um pre1 that's very fun uh I
5:36:34
like the indicator on the ground you know I like that a lot so I'm I'm getting used to I think the parts I don't like about it are really just
5:36:40
growing pains for me as I adjust to it I think that makes sense how do you feel about calling at Turtle Port before it
5:36:46
gets upgraded that's cool I like that that's a cool idea all right I'm behind it we'll see whether we'll see whether
5:36:52
that drives with everybody else but I kind of like turtle Port uh before it gets Unleashed and then it can just be teleport from that point on sure as Nong
5:36:59
shim they've started off these grubs life getting some uh information there because they did just kill the control W
5:37:05
that he had put down they can be be there at a moment's notice the paranoia back off cool down once again I think
5:37:11
that piosik is looking for an opportunity here but it is Nim being able to lock down at least one of them
5:37:16
life goes in there's the paranoia they do get the flash out from Fisher gravity field not really doing too much as
5:37:22
bulldog has to flash himself out of the way the ulti from Gideon gets him in there and Bulldog nowhere to run and will be taken down goic the same fate
5:37:29
and this is one of the issues with this draft if the Wombo doesn't work you got nothing left yeah and you need you need
5:37:37
have your Aurora in position to really help Zone and and then you can actually win both sides of the fight while one of the carries gets pushed out but this is
5:37:44
going to be a plate going over the Fisher on top of three grubs going over and uh the dragon was already picked up
5:37:50
so this is looking great for n shim dudo oh dear you do not want to be in melee range with this guy who's going to go
5:37:57
all out thankfully he gets to just dip Between Worlds and he's going to be fine the ulti comes through from Doo but he misses the
5:38:02
Q got to charge things up and it looks like ulti for ulti is just going to be the trade no flashes no nothing and it's
5:38:09
just fine it's all right little bit of action but watch this Flash from fer
5:38:15
like he's isolated on the side of the fight so he looks like an ideal Target here but he's able to flash the fat wall
5:38:21
here and then the re-engage from lens is beautiful and both of you know bulldog
5:38:26
and life here just completely shut down out of the fight and then if the setup is better for Dudu maybe you actually
5:38:34
can win that but just nowhere to be seen and just go for for one big combo onto a player who simply flashes out of Dodge
5:38:40
and end up losing out as a result so two kills now to n shim two fets of strength
5:38:46
or 2/3 of the feet of strength I should say um the grub pickup and you know
5:38:51
we're still at a fairly even game State here but we're going to have to see dnf set up a little bit better than that and
5:38:58
if that's how they're going to fight really wants that Ward it's supportal combat yeah and he's able to take that
5:39:03
one down life going to be walking over a w of his own as we saw there but doesn't
5:39:08
actually sweep that one out I don't think no never mind he will and so like you say supportal combat indeed as spos
5:39:15
just does none of it where's do yeah like what and what's the outcome of this
5:39:20
like what are we what are we doing here is now King and no ulti but still going to be going aggressive here that was
5:39:25
weird didn't know that's how the interaction worked as Nim going to try and steal away a bramble B you can see
5:39:31
Bulldog going to get pulled over life is here as well Berserker he can kill her Instinct in lens finds the angle there
5:39:37
as life gets the magnet storm over the wall with the eathan rain and Berserker is able to lock down the kill onto the
5:39:42
Victor you can see now wants to find the opportunity he gets in there the feather storm comes down though does he have the
5:39:48
feather pull the answer is no has Berserker looking to try and dash his way out with that supercharge but the audacious charge is going to be better
5:39:54
and it's a double kill for Gideon he's now even further ahead in this game as Nong shim not going quietly into tonight
5:40:02
no certainly not and uh that's four kills to the xinia in this game he has
5:40:08
all four um they're under his name and on top of a very squishy kaisa is able
5:40:14
to get it done there was a really nice cool beginning to that fight it looked like dnf had the turn of the century
5:40:21
with how it looked like oh things are look a little bit rough for piosik the Oriana setup isn't great here look at
5:40:26
Bulldog you know he's already lost a third of his health and then it's a both a disengage here for piosik as well as
5:40:32
kind of a re-engage when he goes back in here he flashes over the wall Victor is
5:40:37
down and you're like okay this is pretty good but then things get a little bit messy cuz Berserker decides to opt in to
5:40:43
go over the wall J has his ultimate and when it's just kaisa versus Zia in that
5:40:48
type of interaction yeah I guess it is the counter you know in that specific case I think they could have just been
5:40:53
happy with the kill they got and walked away their Berserker saw blood in the water that's just the type of player he
5:40:58
is um but if in this case if he had a little bit more restraint it probably would have turned out better for them yeah I could imagine that this is uh so
5:41:05
far not necessarily been the Wombo Combo dream that uh the DM freaks have been
5:41:11
looking for is going to be an ocean soul this game as we have that feed of strength now completed so it is just
5:41:17
first turret for either team whoever gets it can buy some cool shoes which is
5:41:23
pretty dope his life is going to find the shattering strike towards leens magnet storm does nothing and he XG
5:41:30
players man there there's some beef between them there is certainly some beef they're going for like best XG
5:41:35
player award or something like like that and now rer liked me
5:41:45
better he came back to the LC for me well he's not playing with you well he's not playing with you either is yeah
5:41:50
exactly pretty sure he came back for Delight PR could you imagine like the the dnf or
5:41:57
nongshim like battle against gen that is going to be the biggest one that's where all of the beef really lies this is just
5:42:03
the initial taste test yeah I don't know there has been a lot of interaction between these two yeah uh this game as
5:42:10
Herold is up as well and lens yeah looking for Bulldog here gets Charmed up
5:42:16
and the chaos storm doing a fair bit of work but uh Bulldogs going to be able to walk away from it looks like Nim they'll
5:42:22
be able to collect themselves another one that is a fourth as far as these objectives are concerned it's not Earth
5:42:28
Wind and Fire so that's a little bit of a shame and the rift arel does go down that will be secured here by Gideon he
5:42:33
can put that down wherever he likes suned Sky almost has Cleaver completed as well as okay paranoia comes in
5:42:39
they're going to get the combo but can they get the kill that's the question the answer yes they absolutely can well
5:42:45
it turns out they can only kill Fisher this game but they've done it three times so it's starting to stack up you
5:42:50
yeah it's working I mean uh you know if you have a plan and you stick to it then often times things can go quite well it
5:42:57
was a really nice idea there though obviously D shim were trying to bail out after getting that Herald dropped um and
5:43:03
then you have the punish to come through here lens had a really success uccessful setup in the last exchange but then
5:43:10
there's that combo once again fer has been the primary target he's feared he is just dead nothing he can do even
5:43:17
Flash in there wouldn't have saved him now The Herald May guarantee that second feet of strength here yeah exactly can
5:43:24
use that to push towards any of these outter turrets and try and take them down that mid lane outer is looking juicy primed and ready here for Shell to
5:43:31
come down so far they haven't utilized it though you can see Gideon can park her here in this mid lane if you would
5:43:37
like to but instead he'd be holding on to it for the minute you mentioned in our last series like okay uh you know
5:43:43
the gold is where it needs to be this no weird situation where the jungler has four kills well this time we have that
5:43:49
situation it's not ideal for Nim I think this game is a lot closer than it initially appeared because of it is it
5:43:56
the worst though because I feel like a Fed zins out isn't the most terrible thing in the world I it's not Sani you
5:44:02
know yeah yeah yeah I think you'd prefer something like a vgo to get super fair cuz like it's feels like a legitimate
5:44:08
carry threat but zenzo I think can still really get some carrying done yeah like
5:44:13
you know he can utilize that gold to just drop a Herald into a turret and that gives you a feet of strength so
5:44:18
there you go gets another charge there as well Zer gets 25 gold but I'd probably take the charge I think
5:44:24
so um well that's that's huge that felt like a very uh passive I'm just going to
5:44:31
drop this and they're just going to take it situation and that that's certainly what happened he got the additional
5:44:37
charge as well so feeling really good about that is okay oh I've seen this movie before this time it's going to be
5:44:43
a slightly different version this one is a little bit colder and Aurora is going to be able to grab that kill so yep um I
5:44:50
think the dnf have given up on winning the game they're just going to kill fer as many times as
5:44:56
possible going to come on through yeah I think that lens thinks he's found an option here Berserker is in the vicinity
5:45:03
but I think kingan understands he's probably not going to be able to win this one out with uh Gideon still moving out of
5:45:09
Base okay well minus one gante teleport but little turret action in the bottom
5:45:16
Lane for Bulldog he's going to have his teleport back online pretty soon so as long as nothing bad happens here
5:45:23
feeling pretty good about how they were able to answer this teleport Fisher is going to actually come over here and
5:45:29
clear this real quick cuz he's Victor but that that wasn't the most ideal usage of teleport true I have some be
5:45:35
wolf yeah I think well let's go Grill it and make some amazing I think the new Victor mini map
5:45:42
icon looks too similar to Vol Bears what the the weird face thing yeah um doesn't
5:45:48
it look a bit like volibear if you like squint your eyes well you know I was waiting to to to use this for like a a
5:45:56
low State and I guess we're kind of in one yeah when did Victor become protos like like come on I thought he was just
5:46:02
like this mad scien is protos or is it ELO like is it like is it St or is it Warhammer no it's he's protos man he's
5:46:09
zol's cousin we who is Z's cousin apparently Victor
5:46:16
man I don't know oh okay it's just Victor okay mind like seriously all I can see is a
5:46:22
protos when I see him every time okay so what we need we just need the voice actor to do like my life for a and then
5:46:29
like it' be so good right I think it's the cross we all been missing need yeah yeah yeah we really need to like dig
5:46:34
into the meme it has to happen have you watched AE yet I haven't
5:46:39
actually that's why I don't really know a lot about why it's like this yet I've been waiting I've been prepping I've had
5:46:45
a lot of stuff going on there's a lot I was traveling I haven't seen it yet but I need to see it I haven't seen it yet I
5:46:51
watched I need to watch it again cuz uh it got a bit like there's a lot um as as
5:46:56
that show went on so it's not the easy watching you know you're not like watching scrubs or something as lens is
5:47:01
going to be able to watch out for the shattering strike and does make his Escape yeah arcan was defin not my like
5:47:07
the first season was definitely not my late um Night Watch like it was definitely like early in the morning and
5:47:14
I'm really hyped it like hyperfocused he said that I should have watched it cuz it should have been my prep for uh the
5:47:19
season that's true yeah she's she's a bit a bit uh a bit upset I'm in trouble um why you watch I watched it don't
5:47:26
worry I watched it don't worry um enjoyed it I actually thought it was fantastic spoilers
5:47:32
gon thankfully we can only read that wolf just don't read it out okay there just there's Arcane season 2 spoilers in
5:47:39
our prompto right now ladies and gentlemen that's what uh and we're doing our best right we're we're avoiding it
5:47:45
because much like wolf there are some people that haven't seen it yet all right hold up okay atakan has been
5:47:51
started Vision being delivered and lens is on a flank angle but it's so far away
5:47:56
for Bulldog oh Berserker is going to get caught out they all just dive on top of him there's the ulti and the Flash out
5:48:03
though and the chaos storm comes down and the thre man shock wave is gone once again fer is dead and this time
5:48:09
Dudu is on the perfect flank angle oh out of that guy he really does kill some
5:48:16
teams and it's going to happen once again as dnf they'll be able to take him down I thought initially it was
5:48:21
Bulldog's teleport on the flank there but it was actually dudo and he's able to after the fosic Bulldog combo there
5:48:28
the nocturn Oriana setup he's able to lock them down while they can't Retreat it actually ended up being very
5:48:33
beautiful here from dnf you have to trust that you're going to hit the combo in the situation you can see that teleport I'm talking about down to the bottom um here as Oriana shows up
5:48:41
towards the top side and Berserker flashes the wall here and then Lights Go Out life sets it up with the magnet
5:48:48
storm too and then dud here like oh you guys thought you were getting away you thought you were going to cut your
5:48:53
losses no it's even worse and they will walk away with a vicious Aon here and a
5:49:00
ton of advantages now across the board they should be able to also deny the soul uh here utilizing thisan at the
5:49:08
same time and so dnf they will move towards a gold Advantage for the first time it feels like in a long time in
5:49:15
this game as Berserker can just feel free to go aggressive is going to continue to do so lens has the battle
5:49:20
dance so he's going to be able to get himself out of the way as the rest of nim are all grouped up wanting to try and send dnf back home although it does
5:49:27
feel like a free ticket with this vicious arakan or just Aron in general I think one of the big problems I have for
5:49:33
the game State here for Noam is just simply like we talked about how all the money's on jincha but also the main big
5:49:41
damage dealer the safe damage dealer in the Victor is just so far behind yeah it's not feeling too safe as they catch
5:49:46
him once again down he goes and remember they get a free ticket home that's
5:49:52
precisely what they want life's going to die back in get the Magnus oh my God the damage is revolting Dudu is under about
5:49:59
seven turrets and he's just going to take the easy way out they take two with them they do no damage to the turret but
5:50:05
they have a great time yeah 06 and I I swear it's not even fish's fault yeah no it's a shutdown
5:50:12
onto Gideon as well I'm not sure who got the kill um but that's that's also big money that they pick up on this play and
5:50:19
it's just time after time after time they kill fer they focus him down who
5:50:26
gets that shut down looks like it's actually Oriana yeah so that's even worse and the life is just happy to to
5:50:32
toss his magnet storm out to uh to set up the return home and hey I mean they did all die right or
5:50:40
like pseudo die so that is like five pedals yeah kind of good you only give
5:50:46
away 40 like you get 40 gold per kill that's more than a cannon pedals worth of adaptive damage and a little bit of
5:50:52
experience points there you go I guess it's worth it Atlas uh I'm looking at the money at the top of the screen though and I'm thinking nah probably not
5:50:59
and uh we're going to see it again oh God this time it's the zire that's taken out J didn't really know what was going
5:51:06
on the were off and then his lights were out uh it's possibly Baron time I think
5:51:11
it's pretty reasonable to to do Baron here yeah I I going to give you that one uh-huh um yeah let's see the damage
5:51:18
taken I'm surprised fer is lower though he doesn't have enough Health to
5:51:24
take that much damage it's just like current Starcraft 2 balance Pros is underpowered it all goes back to that
5:51:31
all right Pik taking so much damage from this Baron as we can see dude are going to have to help out without I think isz
5:51:37
now kingan could be in trouble he eats a whole bunch of the CC but Fisher he eats a slowy wall and he doesn't really want
5:51:43
to the cast on doing a lot of work here but the magnet storm is going to do the same thing maybe an overstep though as he's taken out desker getting into that
5:51:50
back line Gideon might be going down again and yes he does there's no damage to take him out and it's two going into
5:51:57
the hands of the Kaiser and now kingan is surrounded by dnf Boys jiu trying to
5:52:03
make his way back and he does manage to get a few of these the feather storm comes through but oh the feather pull is
5:52:09
gorgeous oh then Bulldog also flashes but doesn't get the kill yosik has the ultimate and jiu doesn't have his and
5:52:16
he's dead oh but the feathers the feather's taking out okay so pushing solo the baron and it's worth it my guy
5:52:23
wait how did he mess that up how did he walk into those Bulldog man you flash and miss and don't get he really wanted
5:52:30
to put a command protect on pososi you know just in case the 10 Health Z is
5:52:35
going to kill him that's not okay okay Berserker is the first to die at this time around okay hold on I want
5:52:41
to watch this again I don't care about anything except like the ending like yeah this is cool it's like Aurora zoning yeah Fisher dies again yeah I've
5:52:48
already seen this movie he does a lot of damage by the way with the re-engage here from the hens that's what kind of saves this but I just want to see
5:52:55
bulldog in these final moments we're do there's like a dragon so I don't know if we will but anyway I'll have to go watch
5:53:01
it on YouTube later cuz he flashes and then doesn't get the okay we have to
5:53:06
come out of it a little bit of a shame as Fisher uh do we need to see I mean he's probably dead again uh okay gravity
5:53:13
field goes down that's is dead yeah dragon is definitely dead and it's going to be dnf that deny the
5:53:19
soul and so once again we are going to remain without an ocean soul theift gutl
5:53:24
is going to be taken so be takeen this we saw damage taken for Fisher I'd love
5:53:30
to see how much damage he's done this game he's on two items now he has the uh
5:53:36
upgrade ated boots um I don't know if he could really afford the tier three boots let's just say the current game state in
5:53:43
his economy at the moment but I think he really needs to to somehow stabilize in
5:53:48
this game if there's going to be a chance it's 4,000 gold lead slen is a No Man's Land he's in a bit of trouble here
5:53:54
does have a lot of Mobility as he is recan so able to get himself out but now at 50% going in going to be a bit of a
5:54:00
tough one as Berserker just happily clearing out waves K going to be a to catch that one
5:54:06
so we're still looking for a baron as dudo the fact that he's so safe clearing
5:54:12
these waves in mid really is a little bit of a bother here yeah it's very annoying it's very frustrating and every
5:54:19
time he hits it and Brocks at leandre's just taken away at the health bars a little bit yep he's also stacked a lot
5:54:25
of grasp yes he's very tanky seen still building full damage of course this way
5:54:30
you get demolish and fun things like that and you also just get a whole bunch of health so as you can see pretty
5:54:37
healthy it's fun when you have a ranged champion in Top Lane to just harass people and Bully them yeah everybody
5:54:42
loves that it's good to see that Dudu is like still continuing to follow in the Keen footsteps as of course you know the
5:54:48
DN freaks used to be the Africa freaks where you know Keen got all of his Fame
5:54:54
and Dudu really taking over that one and the both of them play a pretty mean Aurora I mean Nim are really standing
5:55:00
their ground here they're clearing this wave and they actually have a fast track to the baron I mean dnf this is not just
5:55:05
a free win you still have to fight you still have to set up those combos Dudu got zoned out by kingan and now there an
5:55:10
opportunity here I mean the combo set up for piosik and Bulldog but they have no vision there's a scary flank Ward here
5:55:15
as you can see the baron down to 50% it's going down so incredibly fast yeah the teleport is a little late you could
5:55:22
say as now pic yeah no opportunity still hasn't even pressed the ultimate button
5:55:27
and that is just highway robbery dnf I think really bot this and Dudu was
5:55:33
really well zoned out by King and Gideon there and once he moved away they were like all right cool we have Baron
5:55:38
there's no setup Vision here we can clear that out and then just rush it down is level 14 in this game and it
5:55:45
just matter it doesn't seem to matter would you say that they did not factor
5:55:51
in the baron play sure yeah yeah there's the first one uh of yeah I was I was I
5:55:57
was like do we do it on day one like come on it's like they have the whole the gr and everything yeah yeah no we probably shouldn't have's back like you
5:56:03
know let's be nice and all and I think just with the way that this game is gone and and the way Fisher has made me feel
5:56:08
I feel I felt like it was an appropriate time fer is like me in every Sol like uh I'm a bit of a passenger but
5:56:16
um I will absorb the cooldowns yeah yeah yeah it's like no don't worry guys he used his flash um yeah like every time I
5:56:23
die I like Ping the noct Oriana ult everyone's like yay we saw you die
5:56:29
it's fine uh this game is weird because I I think that while I still think dnf
5:56:35
are in a in a very favorable position no are you know sitting on on Baron here so that's going to lead to a lot of gold
5:56:42
which should level out the gold substantially it's still fairly close it's 2.5k between the two of them and
5:56:47
they're just one Dragon away from getting ocean soul which is pretty good for gante it's not the greatest into a
5:56:52
big Wombo Combo cuz you're not going to get time to heal but that's something and also like kingan picked up the
5:56:58
Mercurial snow pierces as well as you can see there towards the top side it looks a lot like a train yeah the shoes
5:57:04
and um you has a ga like his Z kind of been working out I mean it's four items
5:57:11
versus four items but it does feel like J is going to be able to sort of Stand and Deliver um utilizing that gbly it
5:57:18
feels like he shouldn't have been able to get to this point but he was gifted a few kills he's been able to farm reliably the fact that he has a lead at
5:57:24
this point after what Berserker was able to get done and how many proactive plays he had early I mean sitting on six kills
5:57:29
it uh it feels like it's just a miracle what no has been able to accomplish in this game TP at the ready they're
5:57:36
getting the pryo first here on this Dragon fer bought an arm guard right before this bit of a desync here on the
5:57:42
back timer but he will be able to get here just in time before the dragon does spawn I think both of these teams are playing a little bit nervous yeah like
5:57:48
when you see a TP like that and the rest of team is back and you're like all right everybody calm down I imagine fer is definitely feeling
5:57:55
pretty nervous at this stage level 15 really does want to hit that level 16 Mark uh we'll see whether he can
5:58:00
actually get some of that but right now just trying to stay in fog of War as much as possible I'm I'm just saying col
5:58:06
me and cix are watching this game real closely yeah yeah yeah you were talking about him being looking similar to zeror
5:58:11
he kind of wishes he could go stealth dude really does as right now he's right
5:58:16
in the middle of his team possibly creating a paranoia Target they can't group up too much it is very dangerous J
5:58:23
taking a lot here from on a really fantastic flank as well to set up a Big Al yeah this is such an important moment
5:58:29
here for dnf can they make the combo actually work as there's the paranoia biosic not going to be able to take the
5:58:35
dragon now leens trying to keep them all alive the feather storm has already gone down and Dudu just wreaking havoc in
5:58:41
that backline berser trying to do the same thing head down to the G goes jiu but this fight is so broken up it's now
5:58:48
Berserker against the world can he get it done Gideon says no you cannot as he flashes on top of him not going to be
5:58:55
able to do it that's a double kill and fiser is on the board and we might be going a game six I cannot believe no are
5:59:01
going to win this game I just can't believe it and it was a fantastic arm
5:59:06
guard there for Fisher bought some time GI did the heavy lifting he at the ga they had everything they needed for this
5:59:12
one fight for ocean soul that's where this where the real Tipping Point comes through I suppose that last big fight
5:59:19
earlier on too was a huge win for them to grab Baron and I guess they do it Atlas I didn't see it coming well life
5:59:26
is going to try and stop them and it's it's not quite going to work out here uh
5:59:31
Dudu not going to be able to do enough either and with the ocean soul helping they going to be able to take down the
5:59:37
Nexus Nong shim will even out the series we're going to go to all six and the
5:59:42
decider is going to be coming up and we are losing like 30 Champions it's going
5:59:48
to be messy here in this last one Le hens just he jumped out of his chair and
5:59:53
he wasn't even going to look at his teammates there was not a single high five that was not a single hype moment
5:59:59
and everyone just followed Len with heads down because they know there's going to be a lot of discussion in the coaching Booth but they were able to
6:00:05
stay they were able to get it done in the end the hens had some really fantastic re-engages and I do think
6:00:11
there was a lot of hubris let's say on the side of dnf really really aggressive
6:00:16
plays and some halfhazard engages that led to Big disasters and uh as the meme
6:00:22
goes they did not finish game two they did not finish game two thank you wolf thank you for joining me as far as the
6:00:29
uh the acronyms are concerned it's a fun one um this wasn't a fun game however it's a best of three it's totally fine
6:00:36
they can come back they can make something happen in the next one Dudu feeling a little bit robbed after that 36k damage um really kind of making
6:00:45
things happen but that is not what gets you uh gets you games it is killing nexi yeah I mean look at the very little
6:00:51
damage that all of the Nan players did but they did it at the end where it mattered on the critical objectives they had a dragon lead they're able to take
6:00:57
that Baron and that was enough yep crazy game we hit like a 6K gold lead for dnf
6:01:04
and uh unfortunately it was downhill from there these games are wild today
6:01:09
wolf it has been real wacky but it's now time for us to take a short break when we get back the decider between dnf and
6:01:16
Nong shim we'll see whether once again it's a reverse sweep or whether dnf can find the form in this last game we'll
6:01:22
see you soon [Music]

6:08:03
you it's the opening day of the 2025 lck
6:08:09
season so of course it's going to be a six gamer as it's all tied on up here in
6:08:14
this series Nong shim red Force find a way to fight back against the D and
6:08:20
freaks welcome back to the space for the final time today in a pre-show format
6:08:25
Deon alongside chronicler and ox and uh yeah we've had a silly series these
6:08:32
teams fight back and forth and it feels like whoever grabs the early lead doesn't really matter this really does
6:08:38
feel a lot more like solo qu games whether it's a good thing or a bad thing uh I I I'm I wouldn't be able to tell
6:08:44
you that depends on your perspective I guess but it is definitely interesting to see because in both games the team
6:08:50
that got out ofon and then got like at least three turrets off of it didn't win
6:08:56
which is which is impressive that's not a thing that that I was expecting to
6:09:01
happen and really for these two teams just dro the best possible team fight comp that you can get yeah it kind of
6:09:07
feels like atakan has like a hidden buff of giving confidence and the teams just become over confident and Flo but this
6:09:15
is when honestly Nong shim should be done this game should be over the shock wave hits three they try to commit onto
6:09:20
baz don't find him they get completely cooked with this flank coming through from Dudu on the Aurora and they throw
6:09:27
outat I'm like well guess it's a 2 but I was slowly
6:09:33
mistaken that's that's one thing like getting Aon in of itself is f but then they also do the thing where they then
6:09:39
go and push a bunch of turrets and I get wanting to get value out of your false
6:09:45
life but it feel like this time it didn't really set up for anything so it
6:09:50
was just kind of a a relatively even trade they kind stalled out they Dove mid they didn't get that many kills and
6:09:56
then the the reset time and they got like two kills everyone died and then there was enough time before Dragon
6:10:01
spawned that it like wasn't that much of a big deal I will say that uh this is
6:10:06
the first game that this whole team is playing in the arena and the audience knows when you get Aon you get uh the
6:10:13
revive buff you run it down down mid and try to get objectives everyone was screaming at every play they made with
6:10:19
the oton and let's see what happened here at 25 minutes there's the fight clear near Baron and we had uh an
6:10:26
interesting look at comms here yeah I mean this one was super chaotic um and
6:10:33
actually we see Fisher kind out pretty well here he did not have a great game it was a rough one for him but he did a
6:10:38
lot to buy time and jiu is actually respawning cuz he got taken out earlier than this H without his old you can see
6:10:45
that without that ad carry damage they're starting to struggle and it gets very Scrappy I got to say Berserker and
6:10:51
Bulldog are really giving it their all oh sorry Berserker and Dudu uh Bulldog unfortunately uh as as we're about to
6:10:58
see here tries to go for the flash tries to get the kill and then pay some very close attention cuz those feeds on the
6:11:03
ground he's trying to get the nocturn and he gets a free bonus yeah and honestly that
6:11:11
made a big difference you can see bazer in the chat figing him like what just happened like that caught them off guard
6:11:16
and as a result of that play it did make a sizable difference cuz you know the all of n were able to respawn get set up
6:11:23
in time yeah and from that play then we got the reset earlier the reset from
6:11:29
bulldog and you're thinking okay let's settle down Buffs over they had a close fight that's when the baron gets snuck
6:11:35
away Way by Nim red Force they then have Tempo that leads down to this Drake fight that ultimately ends the game yeah
6:11:41
and there's a decent amount of poke that has come down to do before this but securing the ocean soul you can actually see it makes a decent difference in this
6:11:48
fight the healing coming through they do a great job of peeling uh for when the ga comes out the chaos storm the Arcane
6:11:54
storm sorry is massive and then that final attempt to flash it again the the healing the little bit of extra HP
6:12:00
really the deciding factor so the Smite clutch in this one yeah you actually see it on lens there I think the most
6:12:07
actually ended up getting like two 300 health throughout the whole sequence able to get a couple of extra rotations
6:12:12
out and between these two teams our first series had games that felt very one-sided right like they were very it
6:12:19
was very obvious pretty early on which was going to win I still have not learned anything I think that both these two teams are still very clearly kind of
6:12:25
figuring out what works for them I think in the team finding Nim have generally looked okay but then when it comes on
6:12:31
their movement around the map for some of the setup they look really rough and then dnf feel like they should be
6:12:37
winning more than they have been yeah it's also what's so weird to me is both these teams have picked up some pretty
6:12:43
big players you know we have like piosik world champion we have lens as well who's one lck and is a great shot caller
6:12:49
but it feels so chaotic and Scrappy like despite the fact that we have these kind of star players who've gone places
6:12:55
before it still feels Scrappy and I honestly feel like game too this draft of DN dnf they had so much die potential
6:13:01
and yes Z can avoid die but we've seen it doesn't always work before there's multiple sources D was using his off
6:13:06
cool down the Victor got brutally punished they had Aurora and and still
6:13:12
like I feel like the draft and like a nocturn Oriana Aurora is a disgusting combination we even saw that like Aurora
6:13:19
nocturn combo used by geni last year I think the draft was pretty fine for them
6:13:24
and now they can't lean on those picks again so you know as much as it was a close game I feel like the loss with
6:13:30
such an advantage that they had and the fact they've lost momentum I feel like it is going to hurt a bit Yeah speaking spefic spefically about Victor uh fer
6:13:37
said this Victor is made out of my Tears because of how often he was dying that was translated for us earlier uh again
6:13:43
was picked on a lot here uh who else do you want to see in this next draft because when we looked at the previous
6:13:49
draft for the freaks it felt like you got the Aurora you got the knock turn you knew what was coming it's it's got to be team fighting right and the
6:13:55
scarner is going to remain banned like I don't think we're going to see that champion and we shouldn't because he's one of the few like top tier junglers
6:14:01
that is still available uh and we might get to the point cuz we're getting to game three Series where if you're able
6:14:06
to snag up a specific role early on and you can then with bands try to really choke it up for the opposing team that's
6:14:12
something that game three in a best of three is usually pretty early generally you won't see that until game four or
6:14:17
five but particularly this early in the split I think throwing teams off can be a Big Boon I think for me bar the zigs
6:14:24
in game one both of these 0 carries have looked pretty good when theyve been on picks that they're comfortable with so I think the team that enables them that
6:14:30
gives them agency will perform I think both of them are capable of carrying games if you give them the right tools
6:14:36
and remember they are playing for their group uh in the lck cup not just
6:14:42
themselves but for the group all these matches matter and yes we're still waiting for the teams that went to Worlds we're still waiting for the big
6:14:49
guns here in the lck but those those teams are still trying to cheer for everyone you can see chronically this is
6:14:55
how all the fans are feeling right now for both those sides cuz they don't want to fall down earlier and that's a lot of extra pressure right you're not just oh
6:15:01
there we go we're just you're not just losing your own series you're also losing for your team you
6:15:07
can't be letting down the gen's and the hanas it's not just that as well but if if your group loses geni H they'll
6:15:14
probably be fine cuz they'll be at the top of the group if you're at the bottom of the group you might not get a chance to fight again you know so it's
6:15:20
definitely a concerning Factor yeah well Nim has the opportunity to make it two Z for their group will they be able to do
6:15:26
it or will the DN freaks tie things up let's find out as we go to the final match of the day as we send it on over
6:15:32
to Wolf and Atlas thank you so much gentlemen yes there is a lot on the line not only is it just a
6:15:40
victory for either of these teams but it is also Baron versus Elder is it going to be a clean sweep for the Barons or
6:15:46
are we going to see the elders make their way back I think Baron won the first series did they not I think they did uh it's hard to keep track uh with
6:15:53
who's on which team but right now hoping for a tie up that makes things more fun uh no it's uh DRX is Elder so they want
6:16:02
all right never mind so it is Elder that's already up 1 Zer and the DN freaks wanted to even out even it out
6:16:08
with a uh Baron if you're wondering what it means if your group wins it means that you get no one gets eliminated in
6:16:15
your group and you have a higher chance of of skipping plays basically so yeah uh and going straight to the playoff
6:16:21
braacket if your group loses the bottom team of that group will just immediately be eliminated and then you have to play
6:16:27
through the playin and uh you get straight into the playoffs with the top three teams in the winning group it's
6:16:32
actually like kind of a big deal it's pretty huge this is also pretty huge uh
6:16:37
which is the draft between these two teams we saw the uh the space go over it there are now a lot of Champions 20
6:16:44
Champions that have been removed we're going to remove another six before we get into picking them and uh let's just
6:16:50
see what's left up and available looks like DN freaks are like well we're just going to like there's no
6:16:56
supports left with band Leona what are you going to do yeah um is it just going to be Leona and uh Nautilus perhaps
6:17:04
Leona Nautilus and they just uh say well yeah there we are so Leona not let's see what the hens plays it's it's really
6:17:11
interesting to of all the players in the LC to be like you know what I bet L hens can't play a lot I was going to say like
6:17:18
I just really hope that we get the Elise lock in I'm going to need to see it the vi is going to be taken away here Gideon
6:17:23
could of course like play the Elise you know she's got a cool new skin and stuff it's like really fun um but also lens
6:17:30
has been an elite support player since the dawn of time Rumble still going to be banned away here permanently banned
6:17:35
throughout the series so far Cori also has been hitting the deck quite a lot that might be the final ban here for
6:17:41
Nong shim unless they want to get rid of things like the poppy that can be quite annoying I mean Varys and Ash are still
6:17:47
up right so those are big picks I think that we could see Rise up to that first spot losing his Kindred interesting so
6:17:55
we might just trade Ash varis so 80 carries unlock the question is what are
6:18:00
you going to play with uh said 8 carries cuz there's a lot of fun stuff left available like you could play enchanter
6:18:06
supports you can play like Bard is is still here Braum is still here for early level one Shenanigans and you do have um
6:18:13
the blitzcrank the pike uh these types of things um no re for a misfortune so
6:18:20
not as common now corki has been banned every time and Fisher's like thank God and she I'm playing it sorry man I think
6:18:26
you're going to just go 0 60 oh no what is what can Fisher play to stop himself
6:18:32
from you know dying all the time maybe oh yeah maybe Triston should have been Kindred you know you just put down Lambs
6:18:38
or Spite and then you definitely can't die there you go yeah sure at least for a little bit um I wonder like are we
6:18:45
just going to see he's actually going to play mid corki and they're going to grab NY wow NY Cory does not make me happy
6:18:51
however they're going to lock it in well I mean corki could be playing in the bottom Lane still cuz like you said there's no or like you're implying
6:18:57
there's no CC setup with the cork so Jack's going to go over oh BR there's
6:19:03
that Brum like I was talking about the level one is super powerful and it's strong into corki specifically as well
6:19:08
in the bottom Lane so does feel like a really nice setup here for the DN Freaks
6:19:13
and uh this would mean that it is mid corki yeah unless it's mid ezu uh which
6:19:18
could be another thing suppose that that you could be right I would that wouldn't fill me with joy either no no there's
6:19:24
only been a few players that have made mid Ezreal work um and it was not this year yeah I mean showmaker did okay yep
6:19:32
but otherwise the pick has been pretty mid um so to speak well B um
6:19:38
yeah uh spans yeah let's see what they want to take away from Bulldog like azir
6:19:44
is still available and has been very heavily prioritized here in Korea we saw it once in the
6:19:50
LPL at least the games I've seen yeah do you think that maybe this ja could be a flex is there a possibility no I don't
6:19:58
think so all right so I mean I I guess it's technically possible but I really don't think so
6:20:04
um no pii le in yeah he has lent towards that one of course when he was in na
6:20:10
playing against T1 in the world championship that lease in game was so good are we just going to keep Banning
6:20:17
leen's supports here in the bottom Lane well and now that you picked Braum I think you kind of want to right cuz uh
6:20:23
it's not necessarily these I don't know gagy ones that you really want to be maybe like Karma question yeah like
6:20:30
something like that I actually think that Ezra AMA could be really powerful yeah I I I would be kind of a fan of it
6:20:37
um it doesn't Empower NY very well but still a strong pick here yeah you do
6:20:43
need setup CC that's a very good point ital is coming out of the Jungle so it is Lee and Vigo that are both going to
6:20:49
be banned away you can see uh yosik's like oh man why me as that is yes five
6:20:55
junglers that have been banned wait how many junglers five 6 7 8 9 are there any
6:21:01
cheeky flex junglers no so nine nine jungl have been B you go I wonder what
6:21:08
he's going to end up going with here because he has a lot of wild picks uh as
6:21:13
I suppose that might have been a support band towards that maai there for L hens oh and actually these bands here puts
6:21:19
that's 11 right cuz you got gragas and Malcolm Y and Rumble 12 Leona jungle was
6:21:25
the thing that one time is it just going to be Nar here I think it fits the bill but it's
6:21:30
not a lot of setup W that's fun that's a that's an old King in favorite yeah just
6:21:37
eat some oranges and BK no never mind that's a Scion Scion ital is is pretty decent yeah that does stuff I guess cuz
6:21:43
your ult can lock somebody down if you can hit a big Q you can you know get speared after that it's a very nice
6:21:49
front line for three heavy damage threats later on yeah I I actually think
6:21:55
this pick is quite smart here H let's see what is going okay
6:22:00
iburn is a consideration they they could ion trist they could actually do that that I think
6:22:06
they might I mean it would be no magic damage really um but I guess ion does
6:22:11
augment you with a fair bit of magic damage I guess you want something that can burn
6:22:17
through this s like tiia could work here too Arrow into shove yeah and then you
6:22:24
get LeAndre you burn oh smolder okay we're just going to comfort
6:22:31
picks now at the end of this aren't we yeah I think that's totally fine all right what's it going to
6:22:36
be I just give it to me L we need it I mean they need something to set up the N
6:22:42
I guess yeah land cocon it's non committal Mo oh he it's a blitz spring
6:22:49
never mind okay so this is this is still a fun one still one that uh lens is extraordinarily good at gives them some
6:22:56
setup but I feel like it is like it's feast or famine here on the side of Nong
6:23:01
shim and the DN freaks they have the uh insurance policy I feel like it's very
6:23:08
difficult for the late game of of nim red Force to find success from behind
6:23:15
into Dean freaks' composition I would have said the same thing about games one and two with the scenarios we had and
6:23:21
the game got pretty crazy but when you look at ior and brush control the scaling of smolder which is you know
6:23:28
vastly going to outpace ultimately what Ezreal and Cori can do they really need to make sure they don't botch getting to
6:23:34
the two item spikes for both of their Morana Champions and then they need to be able to to ride and Coast that into a
6:23:40
really significant Advantage because as we've seen with iburn for all time you get advantages especially with the Deep
6:23:45
wards that we have now four Health on the ward you're just shoving more and more and more Vision if you end up being
6:23:51
behind against a team and it's like chem Tech Soul you're really doomed um so the
6:23:56
scaling aspect here is not it's not like the the composition of nim has no scaling but it is certainly going to to
6:24:03
fall off when we reach a certain point we've been having longer games today I'm going to have to lean towards Dean
6:24:08
freak's comp I think it's strong early with the ash Brom I think it's extremely strong late from ahead with a small Lo
6:24:14
yeah I would agree and I don't think I mind too much about the lack of engage um just because smolder just tends to do
6:24:22
a whole lot of things as the game goes on but we'll just have to see how it goes because honestly it's been hard to
6:24:27
predict today let's get into it
6:24:41
oh Junction fans pretty loud here today as we can see already the Braum Ash team
6:24:47
looking to invade early does make a little bit of sense yeah but uh well respected looking
6:24:56
to cut down the forest with the Lumberjack Scion skin I respect it um berserker's just Tak Tak the
6:25:05
scenic route to a lane swap it looks like I do kind of like that Berserker is kind of their only engage because it
6:25:11
felt like he was that only engage in game one as well and the way he did it was to just jump forward a bunch of
6:25:17
times I mean when you consider Jax as a pseudo engage it's not and he's not even going to Lan swap either he just really
6:25:22
wanted to get somebody's flash at level one I mean look at where lens and gu are they're like let's take the very safe
6:25:29
path to the Lane uh but yeah the ways in which you can follow up on like Arrow
6:25:35
into a route from piosik and then set up a Counter Strike I mean there are ways y
6:25:40
Broms engage is not our favorite but it it certainly can um be well when it's with an Ivan right like if you actually
6:25:47
land the trigger seed then you can get a bro ultimate into a pretty good position with the uh the extra Mobility that you
6:25:53
kind of get there so I don't mind it life just going to be moving up towards
6:25:58
lens who throws out a hook and doesn't find the Target and that is not a great start but
6:26:05
often times you need a few calibration hooks yeah ASA peanut I think he's still
6:26:10
cting PE peanut is still calibrating now however um I could imagine that once the calibration is complete everything's
6:26:16
going to be fantastic we'll see how long it takes lens uh to get the calibration sorted as it is off cool down once
6:26:24
again well uh life he just likes to use his coold Downs at level one like I said and so far so good he's adding some
6:26:31
extra poke damage and the ash level one ending up being strong again we'll keep track of Bulldog's Stacks with our new
6:26:38
UI it's much easier to see like in the past of the lck we be like when will they click on it um but now we can just
6:26:44
see it in real time which is really nice uh cion could save off a lot of pressure in this matchup but isn't going to be
6:26:50
doing any winning and no it's more of not losing what you want to be
6:26:56
doing a bit of a demolish procu there from Dudu who is just going to wander behind the turret I feel like this is
6:27:02
his natural habitat though right like on split Pusher something like a Jax that can really affect the late game in more
6:27:08
of a sid Lane capacity feels pretty D esque yeah feels very dind esque as well
6:27:13
but digress yeah I think that one of the things I really love about this composition for dnf is that the Jax does
6:27:20
a great job of buying you time in a mid game oh almost almost not able to find
6:27:26
the Smite but still just going to be uh peacefully moving on over and having a conversation with some of these uh camps
6:27:34
yeah well when the Jax gets to you know threaten side lanes and and force
6:27:39
reactions it just means smolder gets to keep stacking and the more stacking he does the more of a threat he is later on
6:27:45
and there isn't a great way to lock him down because he's pretty mobile you know he has his flap as well so he can get
6:27:52
out of almost anything that they can offer like you can avoid a blitz crank Q you can avoid a Scion knockup you can
6:27:57
avoid a scon ult so I actually really do think it the smolder pick is one we haven't talked about much recently it's
6:28:02
really fallen off it's one that was super super popular last year in the lck but and it's been nerfed a lot but it's
6:28:08
still quite strong it still scales incredibly well and it it really does feel like the perfect pick I feel like this is kind of been the the best game
6:28:15
three Tech we've seen so far I love the identification of the
6:28:20
fact that these games are going longer than we kind of expected and I like to think that rapid star also thought that
6:28:26
and he's like well I mean Bulldog's really good smold player let's just go do that again uh we saw it in kpup as
6:28:31
well like there are quite a few smold games but that was on the previous Rift right it was a slightly different
6:28:38
experience as all right got some plants going down dudo gets himself a shield it does not really a whole lot uh but
6:28:43
that's fine just trading grasps as bless you Bulldog Bulldog is one of the smolder
6:28:50
enjoyers yeah certainly is I thought it was I really kind of thought it was going to be Tristana um just with how
6:28:56
much he loved Tristana uh last year and TR ion was one of the bigest combos so
6:29:03
it sus poosi as well and I I do think this is kind of how Fearless is going to go for us in the lck cup is just when
6:29:09
you get down to Brass tax it's like all right well I like to play these Champions let's
6:29:14
go and that's what I want to see you know sometimes we just have to stay too meta lens yeah going to come on over and
6:29:21
look to punch piosik here he punched it there you go spear is going to connect there as well pios going to flash gets
6:29:26
out his shield The Flash Forward from Gideon that's first blood as Bulldog if he gets a kill here it could actually be
6:29:32
really dangerous despite First Blood going on over but no he pounces over the wall and he gets himself out of there
6:29:37
the flap comes in Oh The Flash Forward and bu collects it is it worth it we'll
6:29:42
have to find out in future see whether that flash can be punished yeah I feel like uh I mean it's definitely worth it
6:29:49
The Flash and it almost feels like despite losing first blood it's a trade up here for dnf because getting this
6:29:56
smolder accelerated and getting him to a more stable place feels amazing with
6:30:01
what this draft is trying to accomplish because you know it it's not just about
6:30:07
the the first Blood like you need a second feet of strength in order to get the upgraded boots and the other the
6:30:14
other two go hand in hand I feel like first blood is it's not as important as I thought it
6:30:20
was going to be in my mind because I feel like you can lead some objectives into a Herald and then get first turet
6:30:26
right I feel like that is sort of like the way that it kind of works and so first blood is not entirely necessary as
6:30:32
far as that is concerned but it looks like they are going to be able to grab their first objective of the game as well so Nim looking to really accelerate
6:30:39
that one as Berserker takes turret shot putting a lot of pressure on the je here as we can see yosik's coming up
6:30:45
yeah oh no good old surprise party ion well he's getting Zs with a grump
6:30:51
instead yeah well he's getting zoned off of these minions uh as a result of that so even though he doesn't die he doesn't
6:30:57
have to flash or cleanse or anything like that it's going to be Berserker grabbing a plate here and the Cs Advantage for this early game Ash
6:31:04
yeah is just incredibly huge here I mean he's sitting at 456 the gold Advantage right now and then going back to this
6:31:09
play here I mean this was you know we talked about how we're looking for something to set up the spears well a rocket punch I suppose will do and then
6:31:16
he gets the grab right afterwards K has to flash away Bulldog does so much damage he also by the way gets a ton of
6:31:22
stacks in this exchange gets his flatback online goes over the wall here and flashes for the Q just narrowly able
6:31:30
to get into Q range he is on the edge of it there yeah love the unbreakable going up immediately afterwards as well so not
6:31:36
going to be punished or anything like that the flash about a third of the cool down a little bit more has been used up
6:31:43
we'll see whether Nong shim can get some sort of uh punish play of course Gideon doesn't have his flash but Fisher does
6:31:50
uh in this mid lane so you can see Bulldog having to play pretty respectfully here Fisher's like you can't have this cannon yeah well and
6:31:56
then he gives it to him come on Fisher yeah wanted to continue the shove as all
6:32:04
right looks like there's not going to be a whole lot of jungle here for pososi as the bottom side really does look like it
6:32:09
belongs to Gideon Fisher cheating over towards the rest of his teammates makes sense but I think gives away uh the play
6:32:15
here as life moves up knows what's going on he could be in real trouble that's the hook it's going to connect onto
6:32:21
Berserker he has to flash out immediately and stand behind the ward here for life gets him out of Dodge so
6:32:28
holds on to the flash on the Braum side of things but that's a real valuable one with Berserker now not having that
6:32:33
opportunity yeah still I mean he can just return to Lane and keep putting the pressure on so it is high value but it's
6:32:39
not as high as I think Noam would have liked they really wanted to take him out here to give Jew some refree oh Arrow
6:32:45
going to connect onto lens life will be able to find that Winter's bite so L going to have to flash out as well in
6:32:51
the nick of time because those cust blows were coming through mom gets mad Fisher moves a minuscule amount of uh
6:32:58
distance to the right and that is the hard cter Bulldog uh was considering just taking a turret shot but he's like
6:33:05
I don't have any minions there's some bull walkking and stuff like that I'm not going to mess with it uh over here I mean this is a really nice with L come
6:33:14
on come come on say sorry that's stop stop stop um that was a nice hook though
6:33:19
very hook indeed I think he was saying that to himself was he yeah yeah beautifully done so uh lens
6:33:29
congratulating himself and then telling everyone that it's really not something we should do anything about so I'm a
6:33:34
little bit if I if I had to like take a a little closer look at the game State
6:33:39
you know um with like a magnifying glass not a microscope we don't have to go that deep but just like let's just say
6:33:45
eyesight's not that good I'm kind of like wait where are we so maybe you're taking a look at it with your reading glasses yeah yeah I suppose you could
6:33:51
say that sure or like you know putting the zoom function up a little bit on your browser I see the gold lead is is
6:33:58
very know favorite except for the two Champions you should be afraid of uh for for uh yeah freaks especially that
6:34:05
smolder guy and it is like as far as gold lead is concerned it is like zero pretty much it's like 100 and it's
6:34:11
dipping back and forth uh so you're right I think with the Ash and the smolder both being ahead that makes the
6:34:17
gold that dnf has a little bit more valuable because when you look at the Scion lead it's not significant but it's
6:34:23
there it's just not um it's not going to really stop the Jacks from being jacked later on so I think no should need to be
6:34:30
super proactive here the problem is they're running a composition has two two item Spike Champions that are just
6:34:37
not anywhere near their spikes right now so how this works out is is going to be really tricky and I think lens has to be
6:34:43
hitting Hooks and he has hit so many but they haven't led to Big eliminations they've led to Summoner spells but that
6:34:49
alone isn't enough I think they need to figure out how to use lens to generate some gold here for these carries to accelerate the two item spikes otherwise
6:34:56
uh you know DN freaks are kind of chilling right now I mean bulldog is sitting on 82 Stacks he just picked up
6:35:02
his Essence Reaver and he's just smoothly heading towards a mid game that he's going to feel very confident with
6:35:09
yeah I would agree and you can see that dnf are going to be able to move forward and look for this one as okay Len's
6:35:15
going to get caught out knocked off by the kitchen sink but the BR just explodes okay trade of supports but
6:35:21
where did life go yeah he's gone he's really gone but I mean this is a trade
6:35:26
up for dnf because they got Berserker the kill oh no going connect onto Gideon
6:35:31
Daisy getting mad and going to chase that cat into the brush looks like Gideon's going to have to get out of
6:35:37
there as oh no my money's on Daisy for this one the explosion of that Shield The Flash has to be invested not even
6:35:43
able to pounce over that wall as all right Kik is kind of in no man's land spear is going to connect somehow one
6:35:49
more Arcane ship going to come on through but kingan he finds the flank angle the slowest flap of your life
6:35:55
there for Bulldog ain't going to save him and The Lumberjack to the rescue
6:36:01
Will mean objective number two here for that's right dnf didn't get any of these grubs so it's going to be six grubs for
6:36:07
Nim so denying all of the grubs from the Jacks as well as getting that second objective for Feats of Strength that you
6:36:13
mentioned now they just need to get this Dragon bottom side and they get Feats of Strength so this is a huge turnaround
6:36:18
here looked great for dnf but chasing a bit too deep there especially piosik I have to say on this Iver backfires in a
6:36:26
big way because the beginning of this is great it's easy you know life's like cool I'm coming in here he's engaged bra
6:36:31
with this ash Arrow he's very happy with this and Bulldog is getting stacks on stacks on Stacks in this fight as well
6:36:37
so he's just sitting here going all right cool this is great with me GI a little bit vulnerable here but then they change targets on Gideon he gets rooted
6:36:44
but he's nly so he's super mobile and then they just Chase way too far instead of just saying all right let's set up to
6:36:49
control this objective and this is where things get a little bit haywired pii's on the wrong side of the ri then they
6:36:54
double down on trying to save him and it's just unsuccessful with a Teleport coming through here did he have flash
6:37:00
that whole time I think P had flash that whole time just didn't really find an angle and he he ja was waiting for him
6:37:05
to show up and knew he was missing backed and then teleported in as well if I'm not mistaken so he also lost his
6:37:12
teleport now let's kills to a Scion so game State here is still not horrible
6:37:18
for for dnf but this is a still a huge win because the grubs now allow fer to just delete turret plates here and a Jax
6:37:25
without these is just so neutered compared to what he could be to late game and with six grubs like I mean I'm
6:37:31
saying that Canon's even a split Pusher that and going to be building up a whole of
6:37:37
tanky items and Gideon looking to steal away is going to him though as the blast cone will get Gideon into the wrong
6:37:43
direction Kosik will turn up lens trying to offer something as well as the arrow connects and that is the kill onto the N
6:37:51
Daisy comes out now we getting serious here as she punches jiu one time and
6:37:56
then uh backs away yeah well that's another pick here and dnf have just been
6:38:02
so proactive with the composition that's not necessarily uh you so early game Focus I
6:38:07
mean Ash is so good in the early game at level one with Braum and stuff like that but they're turning this into a pick comp as we approach the mid game and all
6:38:15
the while Bulldog is just laning against the Scion which is uh pretty hard to miss um with your Aus and and your
6:38:21
stacking so he's feeling pretty good about it hit that 125 break point so
6:38:26
feeling very good about the current game State and I think Nim you look at the
6:38:32
again the two item spikes for fer and jiu they're so far away they both have their triforces their tiers are stacking
6:38:38
and there will be a moment where they're sitting on those two items where they can compete with the smolder but they really need to maximize that window
6:38:45
incredibly well yeah and that's what I'm most worried about here Atlas I'm a bit worried about it as well although I'm
6:38:51
looking at you know bulldog and the fact that he's stacking pretty quickly doing okay I feel like they are kind of
6:38:57
intentionally not worrying too much about the Feats of Strength because they know that they have a scaling composition so maybe they're feeling all
6:39:03
right this was a great moment though this is showing what dnf composition can do because if they do manage to find
6:39:08
someone out of position they get it done and I mean it's a good attempt here because you're NY versus uh ivn so you
6:39:14
should be able to to you know try to abuse I's clear timings and get into his jungle and start to punish and and and
6:39:21
use your fast clear speed to take some of those camps away but unfortunately uh you can get punished you know if you get
6:39:28
caught like that I mean the Jack CC the the ash CC we talked about it earlier like how much cc is in dnf it's a little
6:39:34
bit awkward but they're utilizing it incredibly well and consistently well throughout this early to mid game yeah
6:39:40
and I feel like it is like the the followup ease that you have with something like an enchanted Crystal Arrow like it is such a clear go button
6:39:47
and everyone knows that it's going to press the let's kill more immediately as soon as that one comes in so can
6:39:53
certainly work speaking of which The Flash has to be invested and you'll get that every time I don't think valkyri is
6:39:59
fast enough or unless you see it a little bit earlier fish going to be able to make sure that he
6:40:05
gets out scotf free and after the game that he had previously on the Victor you cannot really blame him as all no J that
6:40:11
was not the Arcane shift you were looking for concussive blows comes down the UL is perfect sometimes life comes
6:40:17
at you fast my friend and J is going to suffer the brunt of it as Spears coming on in Gideon going to have to get out of
6:40:23
there kingan might be able to get first turret which is going to mean Feats of Strength Galore here fim as the rocket
6:40:30
uh the The Rock what is it called it's the the the the hook yeah rocket grab right rocket grab why did I not remember
6:40:37
what grab was my brain only has room for so many things apparently and the ivone
6:40:43
is going to be able to take down the cloud Drake Cloud Drake still in there as it turns out who would have thought
6:40:48
yeah um first dragon of the game by the way oh wow yeah and that is also every
6:40:54
is so wait hang on they denied the cloud Drake yeah uh so there they go they
6:40:59
didn't manage to get first turret though so it is all three they almost got like all three R they were very close but got
6:41:06
two of them though so Nim going to be able to complete it it would have been like cuz it stops counting them right
6:41:12
does it stop counting yes it does yeah so this is about the best you're going to see as far as uh getting all of the
6:41:18
Feats of Strength yeah I mean they still have a gold lead here they got that turret top side but remember two kills on the Scion is where a lot of that gold
6:41:26
is and I think this game state is very unfavorable for Nim unless they can find some some consistent picks here it's a
6:41:33
gold lead for Fisher technically speaking but uh the the cheating of gold
6:41:38
and and how the how valuable it is is going to happen here very soon for Bulldog when he starts burning People's Health out including this tanky Sion in
6:41:46
a few moments time here maybe a pick here yeah lens does he get the hook no he doesn't but man he gets a Flash and
6:41:53
now the followup is in Kosik the one that flashes this time but unfortunately Bulldog didn't come with an extra charge
6:42:00
and so that is the turret going down at the same time dud going to try and trade on the other side of the map but man the
6:42:07
proactive play here from this Nim composition is really working beautifully it really is I mean they are
6:42:13
getting some punishes here super bizarre the way that that was handled as Yu unfortunately here um Arcane shifts in
6:42:22
he just has I mean there's a control ward in that brush so he had some limited information but it was a very
6:42:27
greedy choice and he was punished for it promptly and then he's like okay I'm I'm going to look for it I'm going to look
6:42:32
for it and yeah there it is think he knew that
6:42:39
the flash is down there as well so he can get himself out but really nicely done collecting The Flash response there from uh from
6:42:47
Bulldog it's a little bit odd but does not end up getting out safe Daisy wasn't
6:42:53
enough to turn that one around either unfortunately you can't block the S with a d yeah bit sad so I mean looking at
6:43:02
this still winable for Nim and it's kingan who's kind of kept them in this
6:43:08
and I I think that like this is still like Nim need to keep up this pace if they keep up this pace it's feeling real
6:43:14
good they're a minute away from potentially and uh atakan extra few turrets to really push this snowball
6:43:21
forward of course it is a place we have seen games thrown before even in this series so they do have to be careful
6:43:28
there are more opportunities to push a game forward if you do have a foothold I wonder the okay so fer got his second
6:43:34
item now I wonder how much gold J has right now because if he can also get Morana here that double item Spike
6:43:40
before the uh you know 225 is hit here for bulldog and get Aon out of it like
6:43:47
that fight they win that one then they're they're in the driver seat again completely in this game and J is so
6:43:52
close to Max stacks on his tier as well so as soon as he completes this he's going to be he's got to be so close to
6:43:57
finishing it you know he did buy boots uh so maybe that's going to make it a little bit more I see but he's pretty
6:44:04
strong he is also 30 CS behind so missing a lot of that farm so maybe he needs a little bit more time here so he
6:44:10
doesn't have it just yet but doesn't mean that dnf is going to start it up before he gets it and he not in a
6:44:15
position to do so Dudu is wishing so badly that he had grubs but I don't think he needs them to take this turret
6:44:21
out he has teleport and onim are going to try to take this Harold yeah so the herald will be
6:44:27
secured dud is going to split push to his heart's content though it's actually kind of big
6:44:33
the fact that dud can actually be useful in a sid Lane really be helping out because if Nim are forced to group up to
6:44:39
make their composition work then it can be a problem is all right life just going to tank it up don't hook Brom he's
6:44:45
got a big door he doesn't care Doo finds a flank angle and they're going to lock down the Sion who takes a lot of Killing
6:44:53
In fact maybe too much killing and finally he does go down Berserker with that Q activated doing a lot of damage
6:44:59
as you is able to keep himself safe and the zombie is not going to do enough at all and dnf come alive here at 20
6:45:06
minutes yeah I just I don't fully understand the thought process on this one from Nim but looking for a pick
6:45:12
starting to feel the pressure they had just taken the herald they weren't fully grouped for a pick there and Braum is
6:45:18
ready for the reengage so like look at where corki and naly are right now on
6:45:23
the mini map when this is happening Gideon Gideon comes down here but you hook the Brom you're already so low bu
6:45:30
has life actually with some great movement puts himself in front I think it was once again lens going for the ash
6:45:36
but wasn't able to get there you got to be so careful about making moves like that when you don't have full control
6:45:42
now that the herald doesn't necessarily get the value they were hoping for and
6:45:47
we'll see if they find a good angle for period basically in this game as you can
6:45:52
see the gold lead back now in Dean freaks but it's again more about the number of stacks on Bulldog more than it
6:45:59
is about the gold that's the big concern here the ash is already well and truly online on Two and a Half
6:46:05
items and still no Mor here for JE yeah not quite able to get that one done I
6:46:11
don't think he's actually being backed has he oh he did he bought his uh he finished the cor field so unfortunately
6:46:17
just didn't have very much money yeah he's I mean he's super low Eco with the lack of Cs I suppose is the main thing
6:46:22
here has doesn't have any kills there's the herald drop here feels so against the play doesn't it with the
6:46:28
herald going down in favor of nim like you'd expect them to have a bit more control dead lens is running away
6:46:35
Gideon's just going to be left out to the Wolves will make that the dragons his mom comes down and eats him almost
6:46:40
out yet kingan what's he tanking for nobody else is sticking around and he is
6:46:46
just going to be left out as dnf I think it looks to me like Nong shim have just
6:46:51
kind of ran out of URS they've ran out of you know what to do I mean that's the Bulldog finishing his Stacks as well I
6:46:58
think that's the game well very likely off of that play and and they Dro heral
6:47:04
and it's just completely ignored and man life has had such a fantastic and fun game here on this Ram he just doesn't
6:47:10
care about anything and the alss we're seeing for Bulldog have been phenomenal yeah and we have to go back to the first
6:47:16
game as well life looking real good life almost being able to steal a red bu kind of hilarious as Aon is going to be
6:47:22
secured here by dnf and and let's give Berserker credit where it's oh 100% his arrows have been so good this game and
6:47:29
with how good Berserker was in the first game would he get player of the match right now he's 100% my vote something
6:47:36
crazy changes and and yes Bulldog is going to do the big boom boom but I'm not I don't think I can be a boom boom
6:47:41
goer here cuz he's been so empowered by that Arrow it's just the arrow and there have been so many of them just
6:47:48
completely ignore the the heral cuz they're like doesn't matter about our mid turret we've already gotten past the tough part Bulldog's already stacked so
6:47:54
we just don't care and out off this fight and hitting cion a lot he does finish those Stacks in this moment and
6:48:01
now everything gets so much harder it was already Tough Enough yeah now they have an extra life it's you know hextech
6:48:08
dragon is up here but it's the second dragon of the game with 24 minutes in like neither of these teams have any interest League of Legends now is so
6:48:15
crazy with the fact that yeah we're 24 minutes in with two Dres no one's no one cares about Drake anymore as Berserker
6:48:21
and Bulldog both doing a lot of damage this game kind of amazing that uh a uh smolder is topping the damage at 24
6:48:28
minutes you feel like that should take a little while longer to come in but that is is just the game State yeah and it's
6:48:37
Mountain soul but I don't think smolder really cares no with his uh percentage
6:48:43
base burn I think he would like to have it himself yeah that could be pretty huge he does have a two dragon lead the
6:48:50
question is do we get to four dragons in this game yeah um cuz yeah it's a smaller game but he's already online
6:48:57
quite early and his teammates are as well and the Jax has three kills and doesn't have any grubs but car's less
6:49:02
about that than he did earlier on Baron spawns and dnf are like it's mine yeah
6:49:08
let's just take it on spawn of course spawning 5 minutes later than it used to as Berserker he's got some volleys to
6:49:16
keep them out of here lens certainly does need to be respected somewhat for these hooks that can bring a priority
6:49:22
Target in but as you can see here Nong shim not pulling the trigger just yet and it's dnf that are going to do so fer
6:49:28
immediately going to get M as lens at least gets that one done I don't know about that one Doo his mom comes down
6:49:34
but H still going to die mom does so much damage and look at this with the ivone this Jack is just Immortal both of
6:49:41
them going golden Gideon going to get eaten by a dragon you can see Bulldogs going to be a to take him out dogs
6:49:47
versus cats I guess it's going to be Bulldog that comes out on top and this one is okay that's a fully charged Q remember none of them can die ladies and
6:49:54
gentlemen they've still got out of car they have the withdrawal so it doesn't matter like I mean Dudu saved his uh
6:49:59
life or his withdraw by going for the uh armu to keep himself in the fight so he
6:50:05
don't want to waste time teleporting back in he had teleport so if he did die he could have just come back he is going to come back right now and uh you know
6:50:12
at this point I think bulldog's like I would like some more yeah they know exactly where J is as dudo comes on over
6:50:20
the door just eats the true shot barrage this Brum has been such an incredible pick and they get in there you can see
6:50:27
kingan trying to utilize that ultimate to lock them down as Len's not going to be stealing that one away that's going
6:50:33
to be the baron secured by piosik kingan is now a zombie as Bulldog just trying
6:50:38
to Flap his way away and will be able to do so the Sphere not going to connect jiu able to offer back a lot of damage
6:50:44
here as Dudu does need to be a little bit careful as the auu just barely not able to get him as oh the arrow for the
6:50:51
snipe doesn't quite get in there but the damage has been done the baron has been secured and Berserker is already utilizing it in the mid lane Bulldog's
6:50:57
about to have his ult back too it was a real world where maybe something uh could have happened there with could
6:51:02
have looked for a snipe there on those retreating no members but I mean with
6:51:08
Baron up they already got 3,000 gold nearly with it it's just what do you do in the situation as Nim you're you're
6:51:14
struggling as lens because you can't get an angle to grab the baron and Daisy are working against you fer is in is in no
6:51:21
man's line he can't actually get close to anybody to hit any priority targets they all have res anyways and the ult
6:51:27
from Bulldog have been so clean so high value in these choke points all game long this is that uh
6:51:33
hourglass or rather the arm guard I was talking about like a temped fate with the fact that they used it in such good timing yeah and then you know you're
6:51:39
sitting here going what do I do like I can't I can't do anything there's there's nothing here there's no tools
6:51:46
there's no n there's no Smite but we're still trying to to be around this smolder and it's a bad time well lens is
6:51:52
going to get a hook onto a Brom and this time he's dead um nicely done so they
6:51:58
managed to take down life for 40 seconds that might stop this push I feel like the Brum is extremely valuable for this
6:52:04
composition they've already got 2600 gold on the Red Bull Baron power play and so a lot of the damage has been done
6:52:11
but that will put a dampener into it a smolder just gets stronger and stronger though it it slows the game but it
6:52:18
doesn't it doesn't make things any better unless you can get really a team Fight Win somehow you need to to get multiple members yeah and I leen's
6:52:25
grabbing a smolder is just optimistic at best when
6:52:30
this braah has been doing such a good job when Daisy is so frustrating to deal with when he has flap and he's fairly
6:52:36
mobile he can get over walls he can just stay away from you and still be such a pain to deal with I mean he can utilize
6:52:41
minions to increase his range he can utilize kingan to increase his range and just keep queuing you and harassing you
6:52:46
we've just seen that in the lck when smolders get online pretty you know
6:52:52
relatively easily without any problems you don't come back from that we've very rarely seen comeback games I
6:52:59
mean G was like I once I got online with smolder the game in for like over an hour not to mention the fact that
6:53:05
Berserker can do things like this now that he has the big old Shield life diving into so many people but look at
6:53:10
the value of the door it is disgusting how much this does as lens yeah that
6:53:15
rocket punch not doing too much of anything and now Dudu feeling Immortal himself as long as he has that gentleman
6:53:21
tree around him and he's going to go golden there utilizing that zus repaired his arm guard quite nicely but the
6:53:27
turret is getting angry and finally he is going to go down Bulldogs are full health though and N shim I think they're
6:53:33
losing an inhibitor turret at least because Berserker is just by himself in the bottom Lane yeah he just doesn't
6:53:39
care they don't even have grubs but we're at the point of the game where these turrets just don't last long down
6:53:45
goes one inhibitor and a second inhibitor turret will fall I mean I
6:53:50
suppose there's a world where maybe they could defend this if Berserker was more vulnerable but he's got flash yeah life
6:53:56
needs to really save him here though cuz there are a lot of people coming that's four uh I think life might be dead and
6:54:02
cker is also dead hook so double kill there have a jiu it is going to be an inhibitor in trade for it they didn't
6:54:09
get that inhibitor in fact did so that was possibly a little bit of a misstep there is a mountain dragon up
6:54:16
and available I suppose you know the series is just going to be messy no matter what is
6:54:22
there any game stage that is unable cuz I'm starting to believe that
6:54:28
there is you mean like there's there's there's definitely a way that dnf could throw
6:54:34
this game and still lose yeah I'm not ready to get like all religious like
6:54:41
you you know my mom would tell me like anything is possible and I just roll my eyes like that's kind of how I feel but
6:54:46
let's see let's see I mean look I I thought there was no world where they didn't get both Inhibitors and at least I'm in good company with my uh my
6:54:53
somewhat spiritual take on how this game could go um I don't want to watch this again
6:54:58
but we are yeah do ever extended a little bit and then with we're going to get a bit of a fast forward and then
6:55:03
life from Berserker are just going to die yeah there's no collapse here um to
6:55:09
try to cuz like Jax is dead so there's just not really a whole lot of heal for Berserker and it was it was a good
6:55:15
punish play there from the side of nim and uh L's hitting the hook everything
6:55:20
lines up he's got his mes completed he's got an Elixir he's ready for the team
6:55:27
fight on this Baron like the okay is it possible is atlas is Atlas on to something here like
6:55:34
anything is throwable well life is going to show them the door and he's going to get hooked in and he's going to die atas
6:55:41
I need to stop telling life how valuable and cool he is cuz it seems to have a negative impact on how things are going
6:55:48
for him in the game yeah um we we call them cter curses don't we we certainly
6:55:53
that's usually the accepted term in our industry for this type of moment where you praise someone and they immediately
6:55:59
are either punished or make a mistake they were called in 2025 you know cuz we hadn't hadn't quite get got there yet it
6:56:07
was uh just carler in our group chat I'm pretty sure on the day well uh Baron is up in 15 Nim do
6:56:16
have cryo Lio respawn in 5 seconds they're trying to just threaten the back
6:56:21
door uh but I don't know they're a little bit split here looks like front door to me sure I I mean yeah but you
6:56:28
know what I'm saying yeah well Daisy's getting amongst it and King is just holding the wave as
6:56:34
best he can no more Baron available as you wow okay pldog they need to avoid
6:56:41
everything Bulldog does that's really important and like you say life is just going to get into position once again he
6:56:47
can soak a hook but he needs the rest of his team to be there to follow up if he does indeed do so I mean they can just
6:56:53
say all right you do Baron we'll do Baron for Nexus trade D's trying to set up for it clearing these waves super
6:56:58
minion wave is very uh fer is taking % of his health bar for no
6:57:03
reason just going to just going to say go away Fisher and um now the baron pryo
6:57:11
belongs to the DN freaks okay oh L hands I thought he was going to do it I thought he was going to
6:57:17
go in as life is going to get snagged by a spear oh it could
6:57:23
be they don't go for it this this composition doesn't have a strong tank
6:57:29
dnf so they're so scared of starting Baron somebody getting hooked and them getting like you know isolated Crow oh
6:57:34
Arrow going to connect there on J but he does get cleansed immediately now Dudu diving into that backline fer in a bit
6:57:40
of trouble dud goes golden Gideon now he's going to get cleansed as well goes golden as well and now J's running out
6:57:47
of button that he can press aring ship Flash not enough as dnf closed in and
6:57:53
with the jungle and AD carry both dead King is going to try and hold on to the wave to keep this game alive it is not
6:58:01
going to work out down he goes and it's Bulldog that's gifted the prize of the kill money it's completely unnecessary
6:58:08
because they're about to take down the Nexus okay uh Fisher doing the fakeer threat and valky is is way to taking out
6:58:15
that super minion but another wave comes through here leens grab one of those minions away buy some time all right
6:58:23
next is turret number one going to go down lens's not going to be doing anything Fisher as well grasping at straws to say the least and that's a
6:58:30
bare Nexus that is going to be a game win for dnf able to keep things
6:58:36
interesting as far as our groups as well Baron won Elder one at the end of today
6:58:43
but I think you could argue that these are two upsets here today considering the caliber of players that we see on
6:58:50
this nonm roster as well as bro and how good they looked uh it's a crazy lck cup
6:58:57
so far yeah this new patch is wild you just don't know what to expect it looks like no team is is fully prepared for
6:59:05
Fearless draft at least of these four that we've seen so far I mean you have your own style and I thought that the uh
6:59:12
smolder pick was a really nice touch but I feel like we haven't seen too many master classes like that one just yet
6:59:17
it's a lot of comfort that teams have gone back to and so it gets really interesting and it gets really volatile
6:59:23
uh in these game States so yeah dude do hitting that DN logo DN fans are shy but
6:59:31
but happy for and uh they're trying to get used to it you know like the qu freaks last year weren't necessarily uh our top teams but
6:59:39
right now this squad is currently leading in the lck cup yeah with the victory here with this win we are tied
6:59:46
Baron and Elder both at plus one so it's dead even going into day two and you
6:59:53
love to see it competitive groups uh competitive series terms of the score
6:59:58
line not to mention in terms of the games as well we've had long games and back and forth yeah and the amount of
7:00:04
times Feats of Strength have come in and then the team that didn't get them has just kind of crushed just like we just
7:00:10
saw uh has been much higher than I was expecting so I'm I'm feeling real positive about how the game state looks
7:00:17
uh moving into the rest of the week because these games have been crazy I loved it yeah I I have to say I was most
7:00:23
impressed with Berserker today on the DN freaks I did give him my vote uh even though Bulldog did a lot of boom boom
7:00:29
damage and it was a team effort and piosik set him up really well uh and life had a fantastic final game here I
7:00:36
think the arrows were really the big story here for me in this one and then obviously his performance on kalista
7:00:42
earlier on in the day which saved them with with what seemed like an unwinable game yeah was uh enough to give me his
7:00:49
or for me to give him my vote it's the power of Na Talent man got Berserker coming on over we got Mark coming in as
7:00:56
well and dnf off to a one and zero start in the lck cup I think it's just it's
7:01:03
proof right yeah sure I'm going to I'm going to give it to it because they
7:01:09
played exceptionally well feel like Berserker here in this moment uh King out very nicely but honestly it's the
7:01:15
way dnf sort of recognize what their composition does and then play to it almost to a t like to a fault right you
7:01:22
saw in in their very first game Berserker went for that play because he knew that the kalist to jump forward
7:01:28
keep jumping forward is the way that we're going to be able to win because don't have a lot of answers to if that
7:01:34
uh the ren set comes in after the bailout I will you know I I will address
7:01:39
the elephant in the room we had some some rough drafts today uh we we had actually almost every game there was a
7:01:46
rough draft uh on one side or the other we also should address that you know NOA
7:01:51
made some big mistakes in this game the N plus no real setup in bottom or in mid
7:01:57
didn't really hit the mark for us didn't have a huge impact except stealing some camps away so it wasn't the highest
7:02:02
level we will see but we'll see that in the coming days as teams get used to this patch and you can see how hyped these guys are for closing out what was
7:02:08
an incredibly tense Series yeah not to mention the fact that the more Champions that get involved right the more we're
7:02:14
going to see teams practicing different picks right so they can have like these extended Quivers that you're going to
7:02:21
need in order to win in felis so Bulldog 36k damage absolutely massive fish are
7:02:26
doing a decent amount of poke this game as well but honestly for me uh I'm with you wolf I think that Berserker played
7:02:33
absolutely amazingly even in a more utility uh type style here that we saw in this last
7:02:39
game na Talent dude na Talent sure yeah uh not Korea talent that like gets sent
7:02:46
to Na and then comes back later na Talent no no no I think the life started last year wasn't that right not like a
7:02:52
player who won worlds and then went to Na and then came back it's definitely it's na that does it yeah the the
7:02:58
hyperbolic Time Chamber of uh of North America um but whatever happened I think Berserker has been absolutely fantastic
7:03:04
he was good in Challenger went over to na we didn't know whether we'd see him again but he comes back joins danan
7:03:10
Freaks and looks pretty good whilst doing it and in fact this roster in general is uh is really really fun and
7:03:16
he is going to pick up player of the match as you can see here 52 and five on the kist I think the most impressive of
7:03:22
his games but even on the Kaiser he found some angles despite the loss yeah I mean they arguably could have won game
7:03:29
two and should have won game two yeah and uh had an impressive kalista and kind of helped turn the game around for
7:03:36
his team in game one there were definitely some some votes you could have gone you could have gone support I think he arguably could have gone mid or
7:03:42
top so it it's just a team effort but Berserker to me was the big standout yep
7:03:47
absolutely fantastically played there by Berserker and now we get to chat to him so he is here for the
7:03:56
translation thank you very much guys this is dear for the P interview translation joined by B on the side of
7:04:03
group de who secured a victory in the second match of 2025 LC
7:04:11
cup you just won your first match of L cup and became the player of the match
7:04:17
congratulations how do you feel this my first stage in the L and I
7:04:23
thought that today's first match would be really important and coming into LK I really
7:04:29
wanted to have play matches and play games that I just
7:04:36
don't regret and I think there are a lot of moments where I died but I didn't
7:04:42
power away I think I just stayed grave and kept playing my
7:04:54
game from the first match it was quite neck and neck so how did it feel playing
7:05:00
on the stage really honest all three games today I didn't
7:05:06
really think that it would get dragged out this long but it was our first match of the
7:05:11
season and I think everyone's just a little nervous and I think next time we'll be
7:05:18
able to be more capable of snowballing the game and then pulling off cleaner
7:05:26
games and after Dean freaks picked Ash BR bot the enemy locked in blitzcrank so
7:05:33
how did you react to
7:05:38
this St was implemented seon and it's because we were Banning we
7:05:46
ended up Banning Leona Nautilus and that really left no options I think that's just
7:05:53
something that he had to play maybe some comt and despite you being the backline
7:06:02
you positioned to always go in first to make some feisty place so what is the source of this
7:06:10
aggression I guess you could call it
7:06:16
agression other than kaisa there were a lot of the a lot of the Champions that I played today were
7:06:23
just playmaking Champions that I can just play without a
7:06:28
team and I think I'm pretty content with my performance today with those
7:06:36
Champions I think it's just rather than responsibility I'm just doing what is
7:06:41
what my job really entails me to do you guys had a really clean bot Duo
7:06:47
performance today so how would you rate your Synergy with life we've been practicing for a while
7:06:54
now so I I would say that we're at 60 to 70% of our potential Life as a player as a is a
7:07:02
very fun person so I enjoying my time playing with him do you want to send any
7:07:07
message to life I think we lost a little bit of
7:07:13
focus at the last game so we ended up getting picked off but let's just get
7:07:18
back on our feet and do even better next time and your next opponent isia please
7:07:23
share your resolution DK has aiming and I consider
7:07:30
aiming as one of the top 8 carries in the LC and being able to face such a great 8
7:07:37
car in the L so soon makes it even more fun and that's the end of the interview from B and back to the space thank
7:07:47
you thank you very much dear for that wonderful translation as it is the D and
7:07:53
Automotive freaks getting their first Victory here in the lck cup and making sure the score is tied between group
7:08:01
group Elder and group Baron welcome back to the space Deon alongside Chronicle oox as we take a look at the player of
7:08:07
the match votes and quotes between everyone go ahead show what you got here
7:08:13
and oh only one denter here on the English analyst desk there it is that's
7:08:19
right opposite votes here hey there we
7:08:25
go I was actually contemplating this a lot and I went back and I stand by it I think Dudu in all three games when you
7:08:32
look at the team fights played impeccably I think he was one of the big reasons why they would get won game
7:08:38
number one he was able to get on gu consistently and uh I think in this Jack was a little bit less flash but even the
7:08:43
catch that ended the game was him so I think he played a really good game but it's fine sometimes you got to take the
7:08:49
hit yeah I just believe in na Talent you know uh thank
7:08:55
you I can't believe I got 10 out of 11 and I'm still not the biggest idiot on
7:09:00
the death that's a true American Patriot right there representing the LCS well form of
7:09:08
the LCS yeah LCS Talent North America Talent Uncle Sam would be proud I am
7:09:13
proud I'm so happy for Berserker in his journey and the first step here with the
7:09:18
Victory and then you can see quotes that we had from our uh fellow Korean broadcast Giga Chad 8C Master Cass I
7:09:27
love this they're all leaning into it what else do we got we over some of the other quotes that we had for them I'm
7:09:32
waiting for cl ah I was hoping for cloud Templars again Cloud Templar really is kind of the maybe we can get it later
7:09:38
kind of the goat he was my favorite comment earlier on and uh I I got to say particularly with dnf even in this
7:09:45
series I think looking a bit shaky when it comes to the performance of bulldog and fosik in case piosik and Bulldog
7:09:51
really shouldn't be too much of a surprise uh seeing life Dudu and Berserker all this
7:09:58
consistent is a is a really good sign going into the rest of the week yeah I mean it gives a lot of Hope honestly and
7:10:04
I mean the whole series this game as well was quite Scrappy there's a lot of back and forth I do feel like uh MIM
7:10:10
didn't really help themselves uh I think a big factor for me was the blitzcrank pick made almost zero sense into this
7:10:18
team um and we saw that it went down instantly it traded for the brao that was fine this flank though from King was
7:10:24
big this was kind of the start and the end of really the successes for Nim yeah I do like King and just embrace think
7:10:31
that he should just play tanks cuz I think that most like is the case who I want to call out is GI cuz I think as
7:10:36
well as Berserker blate I think GI unfortunately and this is kind of something that started in 2024 really not able to kind of keep up
7:10:44
the level cuz in 2023 J was one of the ad car that that was insanely insanely high on and I think that he also
7:10:51
warranted that and I feel like second half of 2024 he already start started see shift and we're seeing it here as
7:10:56
well the Arin shift forward he had halfway through that ended up getting him killed while still blowing flesh and
7:11:02
cleanse that's the kind of mistakes you can't afford to make yeah and again if we're thinking back to uh game number
7:11:08
one on the zigs uh Dan literally created a segment to talk about how difficult
7:11:13
that was let's take a look at our final highlight from this game here at 20 minutes into the 22 minute team fight in
7:11:19
mid lane yeah and we're kind of seeing the issue with the the blitz you just grabbed the broom um doesn't really work
7:11:25
that great and then this composition with the smolder with the Ash with the Ivan you just just kind of Chase targets
7:11:32
down and just consistently pump damage into them it's very hard for this poke composition to deal with uh I think
7:11:39
maybe if you had a different support maybe if you a bit better at keeping some space it could work a bit but it's literally just a death ball composition
7:11:46
from uh the DM Freaks and they piled it really effectively you can see Bika positioning in a way where he's pumping
7:11:52
out damage make sure he's out of range of the knockup moves back in and then it starts getting Channel again and it
7:11:57
feels like he's just not even putting a single foot wrong lens and uh the rift heral driving those those things are
7:12:04
usually a recipe for disaster and here's another highlight of it well also Gideon unfortunately I think started the okay
7:12:10
but n is the type of character where we always talk about the N pal you need to really be able to never make a mistake
7:12:17
and there he was just like he got or or uh Brom CED and and then Ash Ed from
7:12:23
melee range so yeah we've got a couple more of those translations on berserker's uh performance we we can't
7:12:30
even fly them because Cloud Templar said I literally SED my pants looking forward
7:12:36
to his future performances and pony said an ADC who knows how to push forward finish them off Berserker so uh he made
7:12:43
quite the impression named yes right and this goes back even to 2021 when he was
7:12:49
on T1 uh has always been very aggressive so it's really fun to see him back all right let's take a look at the predictions after our first day because
7:12:58
that's right only one of us on the English broadcast got it correct everyone else went 0 and2 there is only
7:13:05
one and after finishing last place in predictions last year I'm currently in
7:13:11
first place I can't wait but at what cost do you gone I I can't wait for KT to lose to bfx tomorrow and then beat
7:13:17
Hana that's going to be great that's right I'm basking in it because last year did not go so well and we all had
7:13:24
an unironic bro pick not our fault that we got it wrong and then the North American talent that's right Uncle Sam
7:13:30
was happy and so were my predictions let's take a look at the standings here after the first day of the lck cup as it
7:13:39
is the DN freak sitting on top of the group as well as DRX on the opposite side and Baron and Elder tied up after
7:13:46
we had uh you know I I think what we assumed were maybe some of the lower end
7:13:53
matches going head to-head and if you go with the predictions it's supposed to get to 22 tomorrow because T1 is heavy
7:13:59
favorites atas the only one who went for DK uh obviously with now barrel and Shi coming in and then on the flip side
7:14:06
everyone predicted KT so might end up with the same score now both DK uh and
7:14:12
KT have a tendency to be a bit swingy in how they perform so we'll see both in
7:14:17
positive or negative sense so we'll see how that ends up playing out tomorrow I mean we definitely need to see more from these teams to scope it out but I
7:14:23
remember I was kind of leaning group Baron especially with Bros Casper performance but now like they've traded evenly and if you look at the three
7:14:29
teams that haven't played from each side bfx are kind of standing out as maybe like the the weakest there so you know
7:14:36
if we see these teams trade games a bit more I I think gopala could pull ahead but they have an aalon fah who was
7:14:42
really good for team mid when they won the season opening got to prove himself to Uncle Sam well we get to see him
7:14:48
tomorrow as bfx take on KT and then a big one the debut of Doran on T1 up
7:14:56
against young talent in shiu and plus Kia a huge huge match tomorrow in the
7:15:03
second one and every single match counts as we are stepping closer and closer to
7:15:09
the end of the lck cup but we just started 2025 lck is now underway thank
7:15:14
you so much for walking or watching as uh again it has been a lot of fun we'll
