[Music] welcome ladies and gentlemen to the lck cup it is a beautiful Saturday here and
26:37
we have some extraordinary games the warmup of course of T1 versus geni and
26:43
then the big one bro versus DK Barrel versus the Bros that's going to be an
26:49
absolute Banger too many bees in that one I am the art the artist formerly known as mobo boy uh I unfortunately had
26:56
to relinquish the name uh I got an angry email um from the the motherboard forums
27:01
they were saying that they uh do not like their name bch sarcastically like I did uh had to release a full uh like
27:09
apology and everything it was really really long and it's on the mo the motherboard forums if you check it out
27:15
but I'm back to Atlas now so thank you so much um for dealing with mob boy while he was here and I hope you won't miss him too much now that he's gone
27:21
this is aux and we are about to get into this incredible day of lck cup let's have a look at the standings some tie
27:28
Breakers to watch out for after our very first game here as T1 currently sitting
27:33
in first place with a loss of one2 and an exact game win for geneng G
27:42
in the final game in like yeah in in one of the games at least of 18 minutes and
27:48
55 seconds was exactly wasn't it 1835 I honestly it doesn't matter it's not
27:53
going to happen but yes I think you're right 1835 wait it's the T1 win so if T1
27:59
lose one two and they win their game in exactly 18 minutes and 35 seconds not
28:05
1834 not 1836 exactly 1835 that's when we'll have a tiebreaker so um you know
28:11
there is a chance of that happening uh yeah big rematch um coming through and we are
28:18
having smash play today yeah once again so riding that along and especially in a match as high profile as T1 gen put a
28:26
lot of faith in him yeah and there is there is a lot of you know big stuff to talk about in this matchup here but
28:32
there is very new news that is very unfortunate uh Duro is feeling extraordinarily uh unwell he is here at
28:39
LOL Park and he will be playing in game one because the other option was to
28:45
Forfeit him uh right now they are bringing one of their Challenger supports over to Lark but seeing as he's
28:51
not here just yet um they are unfortunately forced to put Duro in for game number one so hopefully he is okay
28:58
and makes it through the first game and hopefully it doesn't impact ji too much but still pretty unfortunate news for ji
29:05
fans and ji themselves and duro especially yeah obviously rough situation for him to be in doesn't want
29:10
his team to Forfeit so steps in but uh never ideal when you're in that sort of situation uh do you have this matchup I
29:17
think owner has been on an absolute tear recently so you know the matchup over R quite close between them but I think
29:23
oner's form has just been absolutely excellent I think so too I think uh geni as well have been going through some
29:29
teething issues I feel like they came out of the gates very strong their loss against bro was unprecedented but I feel
29:35
like that hasn't really stopped right they have looked a little bit shaky a little bit of a of a waiver there and so
29:41
hopefully coming into this week uh after they're all well rested after solo they're going to be feeling a bunch
29:47
better and will be able to show us the peak potential of a domestic gen that we have come to expect from them big age
29:53
gap between uh Smash and ruler but the two of them do share quite a few Champions as rer has played the majority
29:59
of them but you know really good Jinx players comes to mind things like this uh and I'm looking forward to seeing how
30:05
this matchup is going to go as both of the teams will make their way out you can see no Duro this time uh he is not
30:13
going to be walking out just to make sure that he is not forced to move around too much not entirely sure
30:19
exactly what's wrong just not feeling very well and so he will be uh taking his seat uh afterwards so both teams
30:26
some fist bumps owner and Canon huge Smiles on their faces as smash carrier
30:32
and Ruler all just sharing some fist bumps because of course no Duro there so double fist bumps are required yeah a
30:38
lot of expectations on r that to do the two fist bumps you know stepping up to the plate uh so pretty pretty big pretty
30:44
big moves yep and hands in now for the boys from gen G so let's see how this
30:50
one is going to go here in game number one I think before you know any of the news came out today this was pretty
30:58
contentious match between these two teams often is right because T1 lots and lots of fans um but I think on paper you
31:05
would not be blamed too much for saying that geni do look very very strong um
31:10
and T1 have had some ups and downs in their performances as well does feel like they are coming together though um
31:16
with the young man smash I think the thing I would say is that geneng g definitely look like I think cuz
31:22
expectations are typically so high for them during I mean I know it's a cup it's not the regular season but we tend
31:27
to see geni is dominating at this point they haven't been you know even though they've only got that one loss to Bro in
31:33
some other games the form hasn't been 100% so I I think people kind of maybe thinking geni looking a lot under pretty
31:40
underwhelming compared to the typical form but to be honest T1 also had some shakiness and that's kind of just part
31:45
of the course for them so I I feel like coming into it I saw them in relatively a a similar sort of level between them
31:52
um and we had a lot of votes going either way obviously smash has been playing really well so how to see how
31:57
much impact that has um but now with this with Duro unfortunately not being in the best condition and potentially
32:03
having to make a sub later in series I I think it's definitely moving odds a bit more towards T1 I would agree I think
32:10
that that now it has swung in T's favor but the rest of the players on gen and
32:15
the fact that like this team is just very very good I think that they would be able to if the stars align if they're
32:21
able to actually coordinate in the way that we expect this team to be able to this is one of the biggest problems that I've had with geneng is that we know how
32:29
good these players are they just haven't been playing up to that level in more recent matches and if they do still
32:35
going to be very very difficult even uh with Duro feeling a little bit under the weather so he's going to give it his
32:40
best shot and we'll see how it does go yeah and if there if he does end up feeling better there is a chance of him keeping playing so obviously they are
32:47
ready to to bring over uh sub if it if he starts feeling weird so feels to save going into game two but fingers crossed
32:54
he starts feeling better uh uh we're all hoping and then we can just go get a straight up series and if they do s them
32:59
out there is one thing that is really fun to talk about something that I believe uh chronic and I have mentioned
33:05
many times in the past it's an example of when rer was playing alongside loopy I believe ly was called up and uh rer
33:13
just didn't know his name so after the game they won and he was like oh great well done aliser at the end of the game
33:19
and it was so incredibly cute because lopy had like one of the games of his life um and it was uh it was very
33:25
impressive stuff and it just always comes to mind but T1 going to be on the blue side to start us off blue side has
33:30
been the side that's been doing the most winning it also feels like the side that gets the cleanest drafts feels like
33:36
drafts have a lot more of a oh it was lper sorry not lopy ler not lopy thankfully we have Chronicle to correct
33:43
Max when he says the wrong things imine getting something wrong about Challenger players I know with five letter L
33:48
starting names ah difficult anyway uh n going to be the first ban away from Canyon this one has been a welcome
33:55
change in the drafting strategy against them and kalista Scana are the obligatory ones on red side and Bessa
34:02
taken away from Keen as well yeah even with a new patch you know uh Scana and cl in touch still just getting banned
34:08
they're super high like the high it's not even close when you look we saw CL yesterday and it was broken yeah it's so
34:14
strong um so basically when you're on red side you kind of locked into those two bands no matter what H some not vars
34:20
has been left open but they're going to look to prioritize that Jace uh unending despair re-enabled so tank Jace feeling
34:26
even better now now with the geni they could look to prioritize the vars himself looking towards the Keen Sante uh first and
34:33
foremost though y so Keen Sante going to be considered will it just be Cante sajwani that we saw find some success
34:40
yesterday although dnf didn't manage to win with it I believe the composition is still relatively strong with such an
34:46
extraordinary front line uh but Varys is up and available Ru exists and so he is
34:52
likely to play it however no it's not going to be civa you don't blind civa here do no I don't think so seems
34:59
prettyy unlikely um yeah just Lo the varis in uh obviously we've seen smash
35:05
play things like e play immediate V comes in so going to punish the immobile
35:11
ad carry and then the Victor Victor was nerfed in this patch I will say in the LC it's been like 100% pryo they've just
35:17
been playing it nonstop we haven't had that same priority and it's been nerfed a little bit but still a lot of Team
35:22
fighting Power especially if you start to get the resets on the ultimate it can just Dominate and you know
35:28
it's been nerfed but not a massive amount generally it's nerfed quite late into the game as well so uh I don't know
35:34
whether it's really a huge thing to worry about is trob is going to lock in the Yon that means that Canyon is
35:40
looking for a uh AP support here so Lilia likely to be banned away Zyra likely to be banned away and then what
35:47
does he play that's going to be the big question here um but still plenty of options especially for a player like
35:52
Canyon yeah I mean particularly into a tank Chase and V can get quite bulky if you end up with a full full ad
35:58
composition going to struggle a bit it does depend on the varus though know if it's on hit varus then you can do a
36:03
little bit more magic damage but everyone's stream playing the Poke barus uh and I don't think that's necessarily
36:08
going to change you do see them start a Target smash his champion pool as you're going to come out as a ban uh already
36:16
yeah what's the other ban if Ash and ezil are already taken away as well as the kister is it just you ban Caitlyn or
36:21
something like that that can uh match the range of the Varys yeah I think that's probably the most likely I mean
36:28
I guess you could in theory B some like MF but we're not really big fans of the MF so no maybe just the kin I think
36:34
makes sense uh unless you want to look towards the support role and Target some things there and you're just kind of happy with whatever he picks um yeah
36:43
they do like playing zy sorry Zia as well as rakan is going to be banned away carrier pretty good at that champion
36:49
yeah I think Z's rough here because you're outrange by the virus quite a bit I mean it's good into the Y but I I I
36:56
wouldn't like it they do find the raan though um something K had a prettyy good game on it before uh and obviously provides a lot of that engage especially
37:02
with the vi fact you can Dash to here then to the Target to CC really powerful
37:07
and as you said Zyra being bound away I think Lilia makes sense if you're really trying to shut down the AP options they
37:14
do take that away yeah it was sort of the guaranteed bands to come in but obviously ji knew this so is it brand
37:21
like cus is coming back anivia jungle this time we've had a Top Lane we might as well put her in the jungle right you
37:27
start at level six if you jungle in ifier right right yeah not not so sold on that one and that's the question do
37:34
they go for they could just go some like Sani ooh oh my God the
37:40
flexibility yeah this is actually hard to to sort of probably is support but keeping the options open and even though
37:46
like at least it's not going to do a ton of damage it still does provide some magic damage you don't want to build Mir Treads against this geni lineup so the
37:53
Cocoon value is pretty high so I think it makes sense um to come out here and now T1 looking towards the Kaiser for
38:00
smash obviously works well with their dive Focus composition but you're going to be out ranged pretty hard in Lane I
38:05
mean it's dive focused in the vi only poppy adds to that just a little bit but
38:10
I feel like Victor and Jace kind of want to stand back a little bit I mean it's probably going to be Tang Jason he wants to go in right yeah good um oh the Malai
38:18
something we weren't really thinking of and now they're still flexing theoretically yeah probably he going to end up in the jungle not a ton of magic
38:24
damage but you know there's enough there so that when you're not building NMR you're going to feel it y um and I think
38:30
ultimately geni have a lot of defensive tools have a lot of CC set up a lot of pick potential um they are playing a
38:35
tank Jace which is a pretty obnoxious pick but overall I think geni should be pretty happy with this and T1 you're
38:41
kind of forced into a situation where you have to you kind of have to swap cuz you're into varus a leise but then you
38:47
know it's the Cante in a swap which is ideal for him so I I think gen kind of
38:52
taken all the boxes they want in this situation no I would agree I do feel like the elite support is something that
38:58
was kind of overlooked I guess in this draft just a little bit but the bands were like premeditated they had to do
39:04
that like Zyra Lilia were just a little bit too strong to let through and so geni orchestrating a redside draft very
39:11
comfortably and the interesting thing is like I was actually having a chat to Prince earlier on today and we were discussing like which side is stronger
39:19
and he agrees that in the LC we have been seeing the best games on blue side as far as drafts are concerned but in
39:25
the LPL red side has been doing very very well a lot of teams are actually selecting redside with s selection and
39:31
so maybe we're starting to figure out how redside is going to work and at least in the side of the geneng camp
39:37
that's looking to be quite comfortable however T1 very T1 draft and something that they could certainly uh pilot to
39:44
success especially with carrier on such a gamebreaking champion in this poppy let's jump to the rift for game number
39:49
one of T1 versus genen
40:05
oh ji fans very very loud and I think they're going to need it a little bit here moving into game number one Duro
40:11
very very cool skin on this Elise as well might I add as Canyon's gone for my favorite love the the the graveyard Maly
40:20
yeah real yard Vibes oh yeah that uh that skin line was was my favorite it's
40:25
like the first Hallows end I think had witching n in it as well oh yeah classic and definitely not Blitz crank God that
40:31
skin was so good anyway uh cocon going to connect here as Duro is going aggressive rer finding a hail of arrows
40:37
as well as smash going to have to go back quite early on in this one it's going to be a little bit of power especially with the amount of
40:43
information given uh to geni yeah I mean he'll be a little bit late it's not going to make a huge difference but
40:49
should be a swap though right yeah it should be a swap but it does mean you're just a little bit late getting the wave I guess if you're stacking it up
40:54
anywhere and you don't miss any Farm it's not that big of a deal y um but yeah T1 have toop at the situation uh I
41:00
think I mean even though it's like a level one fight kind of very indicative when you're playing against two range Champions and you have a poppy of all
41:06
Champions like very hard to provide counter pressure as a poppy level one a
41:12
popcorn chicken value here from carrier love to see it and Doran is in the mid lane yeah um just reaching some
41:21
XP see the top laners we're not seeing that from Keen right now um I wonder if that's a factor because he knew smash
41:28
will be late and but he's already got three Cs and if you look he's to level two that's actually massive like that is
41:35
so rare for a top Lan to do that in a swap you see Doran as well getting
41:40
closer but like he was saying he had to actually leech off Faker so that means that Faker now going to be behind on
41:46
leveling just a little bit choby should have that slight advantage in the lane it's crazy how much of a difference just
41:51
a small thing is smash Happ and recoil and delaying being Top Lane can make a difference in these situations
41:59
uh and you know we've seen Dives be a fa bit harder since the tower Buffs but
42:04
specifically when we're talking about Elise and a maai two ways to reset Tower aggro this is like the easiest dive
42:12
combo in the game honestly um so Doran no chance you just need leave there's no
42:17
turning it around and it's still a good gank right because he can't walk up to the wave can't get the experience as it
42:23
crashes in and Keen you can see just chilling out here it doesn't matter that he's not getting these Minions level
42:28
three is getting closer and in fact one more minion and he'll grab it there you go that is a very comfortable Cante and
42:35
own makes a decision to actually play for his jungle so he clears his bot side now he's Crossing up towards top he's
42:40
trying to deny as many camps from Canyon as possible this means he wasn't there to threaten a dive and Keen is just
42:46
getting so much experience off this situation there's nothing that Smash and carry can do to him 2v one uh and so we
42:55
got to see if this pays off is going to end up with the lead in the jungle but Keen is going to end up with a massive lead over Doran it is a big Gambit as
43:03
Canyon uh that's a really nice buffer on the Bramble smash is now Keen potentially getting Dove but he is
43:08
looking relatively comfortable and oh my goodness that sapling actually doing a fair bit more than I was expecting with
43:14
Canyon being there and it being a cassant there's just no chance they go for it so it's a level four cassan too
43:19
look doran's still level two just hit level three and they can actually force him off 2v one because of the threat of
43:24
the elite you land a cocoon Baris has the beard and you end up just being a to reset the
43:29
AG it is also by the way lethal Tempo so the onit varus rer going to have that extra magic damage and not the Poke and
43:35
now carry it oh dear well owner is going to turn up in time as Canyon a little bit out of time there with the Twisted
43:42
Advance going to have to flash actually to get out of danger I thought that Canyon knew exactly what was going on there but car was able to get the jump
43:48
on him and rer andur just yeah down here in the bottom Lane denying yet another wave taking two plates so far oh man and
43:57
like you say this is something that T1 have orchestrated they knew that this was going to happen and has now resulted in a 100 200 gold lead something like
44:04
that and honestly probably not end of the world but it's about what it means for mid to late game and whether they
44:10
can deal with a with a keen that could potentially run a mck unless he just straight up dies here he's a level and a
44:16
half up that's massive they are looking for the dive now y owner going to move in let's see what keing can do is staying away from the walls which is
44:23
very important still he's just dead carrier might be going down but no Ona picks up the aggro and so first Blood a
44:29
little bit of that feed of strength as they listen to everyone and they've moved that to the first three kills now
44:35
you haven't been watching yesterday or playing the game that is how things have eventuated and yeah Doran has seven CS
44:42
yeah um this yes obviously not ideal but you look the top Keen is two levels up
44:47
now on Doren which is the most significant thing I mean at the end of the day gold is nice it's not going to
44:52
make that much of a difference if you're like a top Lan between swapon but being this behind in levels you know if Keen hits level six and ends up in a one V
44:59
one against D it's going to be really rough now we see the dive again car play this really well with really patient um
45:05
dashes and then moves out of tower range the fact he doesn't need to use his flash even shows how well executed the
45:10
dive was uh kind of nuts that he managed to drop tago at exactly the right time
45:16
there as well really impressive stuff yeah really well played I mean look at this level difference it's such a rough situation to be in and the thing is
45:22
Cante is so tanky naturally but Doren you know the tank ja you kind of BU tanky and you need to prop grasp to get
45:29
those extra stats so he is going to be pretty vulnerable for a while and as a
45:34
result you know grubs are coming up I don't think T1 in any position to contest these this swap back is actually
45:40
so uh so beneficial for Gen because they have then the very clear extra power you
45:45
can even see it in the amount of squares yeah exactly is so silly and so yep contesting these grubs
45:53
going to be a very very difficult Prospect and in fact not something that T1 are going to into at all and gen now
45:59
have just that natural control of the bottom side because they have that uh strong laning matchup that we learned
46:05
about still uh carrier is a whole lot stronger than he would have otherwise been starting this Lane off at level one
46:12
and so let's see how T1 are going to be able to navigate it as they look to head down it is going to be the lethal Tempo
46:18
on the Varys as well most of the time we do see lethality I love watching ruler play lethal Tempo uh on h varis y so
46:25
looking forward to seeing what he's going to be a to do in the mid to late game I think makes a lot of sense a lot of ability to cut through some of these bulkier targets you know on and carrier
46:32
will end up quite bulky and to be honest even Baker will be that squishy and I think the range issue is like some games
46:39
it's hard to play the unhit virus because you know you're outrange or you don't have a window really to Auto
46:44
attack but you know everyone on the en chain coruption gets the cleanse and that is a really nice cocon carry taking
46:50
a lot of damage lit on fire now as dur is chasing after him the burn the repel is so good as season assist comes down
46:58
dur going to have to flash over the wall and he will get himself out killer instin comes down and Canyon was lying in weight he has to flash out but smash
47:05
should be able to keep himself okay but owner is now in trouble he's flashing over some walls everyone nailing the
47:11
flashes over walls which is very very nice um but still that is a lot of f buttons on cool down or D's depending on
47:17
who you are yeah some big flashes there closing the distance over those rocks But ultimately H T1 able to answer back
47:23
one for one in the Skirmish see trying an angle here and it's just you know even though we're
47:29
past that rough level one Genji have the XP advantage and not only that they just
47:34
are so strong in the 2v2 the be damage available to carry he needs to get deleted off the bat that was actually so
47:41
sick from Duro being able to not only repel The Vault breaker but also uh land on top of carrier close the gap that and
47:48
ultimately only being there first and peeling ruler away from Smash there does mean that uh it's one for one yep but
47:55
easily could have seen that go more heavily in favor of gen uh the power Advantage they have right now in that
48:01
2v2 b is is just pretty massive and they already picking up the hex tech alternator which is a pretty massive
48:06
Spike for the elite just that extra damage on a champion who already has so much burst still pretty impressive how this
48:13
game's gone so far Incredibly Close and as we move further in right we've got three grubs over on gen T1 probably
48:20
wanting to equalize that but it's not really a s side laning game outside of I guess chovi who y probably to be in a
48:27
side lane is O dur going to get caught out there you miss the Cocoon you get punished so hard and car demonstrates
48:34
exactly that he get slammed into a wall uh not the most enjoyable situation heroically
48:41
as well yeah insult injury I think and rer stepping forward and I
48:48
think he can be pretty comfortable and confident with how this game has started for the Varys play of the Run King
48:53
should be coming in relatively soon I'm pretty sure depends on whether he wants to change up the build that is often
48:59
what we do see first for the onhit Baris yeah I will say one thing is that Doran is stabilized pretty well in this top
49:05
matchup and in In fairness you know playing Jason exanti it's pretty hard foran to have that much pressure like he
49:11
definitely does have pressure in the match up but it's not like he's solo killing killing him see Keen use his ult earlier and get him low but uh yeah dor
49:19
able to navigate I think ended up buing his flash there yeah um so that's down for now plate gold going over to ruler
49:25
as well as they take a third from the bottom side of the map yeah I mean Gold's even right in terms of feat of
49:31
strength d1's actually slightly ahead but it just feels like geni have had the pressure all since that Swap and now T1
49:37
looking for an angle bot Lane but it's a reset timer for Gen and they're heading straight towards those grubs on the top
49:43
side yeah six grub win condition looking to be the case it' be massive see
49:48
whether they'll be able to utilize it I think that uh grubs and Feats of Strength have been hit or miss when it comes to being able to use them to win
49:54
the game right I think grubs has a little bit more of clear wi condition right you can uh just try and set up
49:59
side Lanes properly and utilize them well that way to gain extra Tempo with the extra damage as owner is going to
50:06
get caught by another cocoon duro's kind of all over the place as he actually um
50:11
buys some health there eating the ignite with his passive Shield kind of cute but Genji still will be able to have full
50:18
control over this grub pit that should be six going their way and those void mites going to prove difficult
50:24
especially with chovy and Kee able to sit inside lanes and the fact that rer can farm from a decent amount of range
50:29
like you AR The lethality varus which does Farm a little bit more quickly but at least from range or safely I guess I
50:36
should say um but still I think that this composition 1 31's pretty comfortably if they would like to take
50:41
that out yeah for sure the fact you have the Y who can be going in the side lane but also when Cante gets six grubs he
50:47
actually gets a significant amount of tower damage and is so hard to like force out of the S Side Lane especially when there's an advantage over Doran I
50:53
think gen would just head in the play T1 a bit behind like T1 committed owner down towards the bot side not not
50:59
realizing that ji had already swapped towards top for the grubs they were a bit behind there so geni had vision control they got the damage on the owner
51:06
and that's just enough for them to secure those six grubs now Dragon up in about 30 seconds and T1 do have the
51:13
advantage here you can see look at the map chy not going to quite find the knock up there with the third Q still
51:18
unbinding the sols faker could have actually taken the fight if he was able to get it worked out just right but you
51:24
saw dodged a whole bunch of what try was trying do he's studing Everything clean with this and you know he has pressure
51:30
bot we look at towards the river there's vision control completely in favor of T1 oh vult breaker doesn't connect but
51:36
there's a ceased assist onto Duro but he goes up into the sky there's the keeper verdict go that gets rid of AA and that
51:42
means that a sitting spider there will be taken down by Smash 3 to one now in kills that is going to be that feet of
51:48
strength locked down for T1 only one more of those to go and they will be able to claim it sandals should be
51:55
pretty close given the fact that geni just needs one more objective to lock down theirs and that bottom Lane out of
52:00
turret is so close to dead man I I feel like Duro was trying to actually get into uh also get hit by the poppy ult
52:08
there he came down trying to get away was like that's his exit plan but was a little bit late on it unfortunately and
52:13
just not much you can do at least typically not a Target you want to prioritize going for on AI because of the repel but with no flash able to just
52:20
pick up the kill and take him out but we see that T1 actually end up backing off they don't have the pressure here and gen G able to set up for this Dragon
52:27
Duro comes back on the map and yeah that would be even out Feats of Strength so
52:33
there that goes Mountain Drake goes down next one going to be hex oh my goodness okay big one presses on and bringing out
52:39
the big dragons for this series actually kind of works uh in T's favor as far as being able to get around the map very
52:45
comfortably as well if you're trying oh ultimate goes wide there as Troy might need to rebind that soul and that ulti
52:51
doesn't get him very much value at all Canyon moving down but opts out of going for anything
52:56
you know we haven't been super focused on the mid lane matchup um other than you know when we saw Faker lose a bit of XP darn early but what we've seen in the
53:05
past couple of minutes fak has just been dodging everything for clean he's he's on point right now on the Victor it's like he's played Victor a few times
53:11
before in his career he has has he oh yeah yeah yeah oh that's good to know I think it Victor is in his top three so
53:18
that means that it's on like I don't know like 80 games or something some uh I need to actually double check that it
53:24
might be even like way higher as I'll just go have a look um Orcs can you entertain everyone for a moment
53:30
maybe go through this replay so D does get the repel off and he's just like if he came down a little bit faster would
53:37
have got hit by K's Al but I mean it's hard to time uh I think that was his game plan presumably to take the free
53:43
little getaway exit plan for the poppy unfortun doesn't able to do it it's good set up from T1 I think uh Ona was
53:49
definitely trying to get the you directly looking for him again won't commit more at least in terms of plate
53:55
gold big advantage to gen so Victor is in his top 10 not necessarily in his top
54:01
five as that is ziai Ariana rise and Ari um but Victor is like nine and he's
54:07
played 48 games so far the Absurd thing is is that Faker has played 100 more
54:13
games of Aer than his second most played Champion that's crazy it's pretty silly um he's played 182 games uh
54:20
competitively uh from the stats that I found here is Duro is dead in the sky actually as now Faker could be suffering
54:26
the same fate chovy moves over lands that que as a chaos storm I don't think going to be enough to deter them great flash as the flash is invested there
54:33
from chovy as well rebinds the soul gets out just fine one for one trade at the end of the day and everything stays so
54:40
even oh owner actually looking for an opportunity here but decides against it
54:45
doesn't have Cee and assist remember used that on Duro just earlier he actually I think got chovy
54:52
there I got Unbound sold this is really intense yeah this this a lot of back and forth I feel like we've had in this game
54:58
so far you know in terms of what they've achieved in macro I think geni have had the edge but T1 are getting the kills uh
55:05
we'll do see this play onto Duro here oh just walks the wrong way B yeah
55:11
Beed so quickly you're so squishy as this a least like yes you have tools to mitigate but really H able to get blown
55:17
up quickly and then here you know they saw the play before on a fakeer they have the TP coming in with a maokai holding Faker still you know very hard
55:25
for toy to miss press here F trying to dodge and just forc UNC position here onits the old unfortunately can just do
55:33
that yep uh trovy actually making sure that he lands the que by flashing on top
55:38
of Faker after that flash did come through so trade of flashes evenly as now try gets that control Ward down it's
55:44
a high value Ward oh absolutely will be able to spot carrier
55:50
out and we seen some big spikes come in you know double blade R king for Gen speaking of doubles fake a the second
55:57
highest damage in the game so far of course Victor does get a lot of incidental damage Down Still impressive
56:02
how much he's been able to e out of the champion I think it's crazy one of these things where you see that much damage and you think man he must be stomping
56:07
Lane but y just has so much sustain with like Shield second win Fleet foot Wick
56:13
it's like an even Lane so the sky on cool down but does get the hammer smack back onto Keen yeah honestly got to give
56:19
credit to Doren uh considering how rough the start of the game was in terms of the advantages keing got we haven't
56:25
really seen any come from yes there's still a bit of advantage in favor Keen but Doren has done a good job of
56:30
stabilizing that matchup yep and like this is the difference between like and
56:36
the obvious comparison is Doran versus Z but the difference between the two of them is that Doran just plays economy so
56:43
well right he just doesn't have the resources he just takes the abuse and
56:48
finds a way to make it the least detrimental possible he's just a chill guy he is a chill guy
56:54
100% and right now he's chilling losing this feet of strength towards bottom side there is nothing he can really do
56:59
about that especially with zero Mana as try will get a knock up on to owner the UL going to be missing here is oh dear
57:06
don't know about that one they do secure the rift Herald but that is a dead elase once again Flash Forward chains of
57:11
corruption down as oldia smash going to have to use the ulti and the Flash to get himself out of there keep his
57:17
verdict going to be channeled but ker not going to use it and smash Gets Out means that they win the kill trade but
57:23
once again lose out on the objective yeah I mean there just been having a bit of a rough one in this one
57:28
but seeing the the barrel cosplay trying to go for those deaths uh chovi not had
57:34
the best performance honestly missing a fair few of those not the typical thing we see hits
57:39
one there though yeah going to be able to land that as kan's moving up carrier trying to defend his mid laner Faker
57:45
down extraordinarily low Alco gaming come in as the flash goes forward from Keane goes all out and Baker is
57:51
surviving phenomenal knock back there from carrier and Keen goes down The
57:56
unkillable Demon King himself he's been clean with it Keen making a mistake
58:01
there on the KE s ch's looking he has the kill there's a great knock up able to secure it with the Unbound Soul
58:07
return damage maybe that's it's a game of just one for one's all over the place I mean
58:12
it's probably not saying it at the top of your screen right there as a 6 to3 is putting in favor of T1 but it feels like
58:18
these trades are so even yeah and they going to see dragon on the bot side coming out just show he doing a fair bit to Doran but you know with the context
58:25
of that last play maybe it's not chovy missing it's just Faker dodging because ke's also having those struggles we do
58:31
see a Miss from chovy here though doesn't get the ult out just whiffs a little bit it's always Faker Faker just
58:37
knows where trov is going to go before trovy does he's downloaded him they look for smashy doesn't have cleanse and
58:43
they're so close to getting the kill tries to B him B him with the p AR
58:50
here a
58:56
he says I don't like it I don't like it not good not good I dodged I
59:03
dodg he literally said call an ambulance but not yeah that's what he said direct
59:09
translation there from Ox I have confirmation from uh gson that that is 100% untrue but it would be more fun if
59:16
it was true that's the vibe he was given off okay oh yeah wow yeah Canyon pretty
59:21
impressed by uh trovy there as well and Canyon said yeah this is huge especially with the fact that they are able to grab
59:28
themselves the first hex tech Dragon 4 minutes until the next one's up adakan going to be available there as well I
59:34
believe looking a bit voracious here today wow what a shocker yeah I know but like they buffed it so that the ruinous
59:39
is going to be more likely in Pro play ORS yeah we'll see how that takes effect
59:45
if it ever takes effect um we you see so obviously T1 picked up six kills four of them have gone to smash and that's kind
59:51
of typical with a Kaiser just able to pick up kills in these situations but it's resulted in him being ahead of
59:56
and considering you know we talked about how they have to swap the bot Lane 2v2 was weaker we've seen Duro punish now
1:00:02
we've seen smash mainly be the beneficiary but as a result this K is looking really strong yeah and the crazy
1:00:08
thing is we were we were talking I completely agree with you the trovy hasn't necessarily looked as good on this y he is 1.6k ahead chovy is choying
1:00:17
he's choying a lot like it just shows the uh the height of expectation that we have for this this guy in every single
1:00:25
game it's like oh he didn't play everything optimally so oh he missed a Q3 so disappointing wow tr's really
1:00:31
struggling now these days you know yeah it's been it's been rough yeah uh we do seean on the bot side 2 minutes 45 on
1:00:39
the next dragon I think it's it's helpful when you're wanted to play around the dragon adakan on the same side but it does get a bit messy when
1:00:46
Baron is up although I will say we've seen uh I guess the Nerf to the buff
1:00:51
where it now gives 200 gold per death yeah kind of saw a little bit yesterday where teams are definitely being aggressive is it a Nerf or is it a buff
1:00:58
cuz they doubled the money it's a buff to the other team so I think it's a Nerf to the the The Bu buff you get has been
1:01:05
nerfed the objective buff has been nerfed but the amount of gold has been buffed for the opposition so I think
1:01:11
aon's being buffed I just prefer to say buffed you like buff stuff yeah I like I
1:01:17
like I like it I like number go big I'm a cookie clicker player you know understandable number go up is like the
1:01:23
greatest as trovy going to look for an opportunity here carer taking a lot of damage has to flash so much damage there
1:01:30
I mean this is what always sort of happens when you have like a squishy support but you look at carrier and he doesn't have SL to position so doesn't
1:01:35
have that initial damage reduction uh but also G the mes which has a lot of value but this is a squishy poppy uh and
1:01:43
CH is six levels up oh there's the knock up on D and he can rebind that soul but I don't know whether he can do it in
1:01:49
time he just explodes and now teleport coming in from gen but they're four versus five going
1:01:56
to come downan still just hanging out in this Tri Rush getting aggressive control Ward going to stop that Ward from doing
1:02:02
anything at all as T1 they're going to try their hand at it yeah they need 30 seconds for chov up and then he has TP
1:02:08
so the longer they sto the better yeah grasping route's going to be invested here as keep his verdict coming down as
1:02:13
well gets rid of Kean and now Canyon going to have to try and push them away he's relatively tanky but maybe not
1:02:19
tanky enough as ruler standing his ground the chaos storm is so much damage and smash Dives in Canyon trying to
1:02:26
survive but it's two kills for the Kaiser already and the heroic charge into the turret Keane goes down triple
1:02:33
kill for this Kaiser and smash yeah I mean he was down in CS that doesn't matter even a little bit 1.6k ahead 701
1:02:41
there's the pay off you saw the play starting to turn in favor of T1 but when smash flew in he just decimated gen now
1:02:48
J's hovering but I don't think there's much you can do here he's trying something oh he's going to back away I
1:02:55
think making a mistake there obviously uh chy overestimates his ability to tank that
1:03:01
damage ends up getting bured out but I think what happened after was honestly the bigger mistake oh he's looking for
1:03:07
smash yeah well smash is is smash is smash he's actually going to be F oh my
1:03:12
God okay well he's going to be sent home 200 gold going over to chovy with the buff out can't he and now he's still
1:03:19
walking after them uh he is back on the map though so I think T1 if they get the dragon here they can be happy yeah um
1:03:25
obviously I a little bit more so chobby gets CC lock the layering is really good well played from on here to give him no
1:03:31
chance and fakers that a burst but this follow-up play so the goal for Gen should be get them up out of can right
1:03:37
Canyon presses are you've done it they've backed away you don't need to do more here but they overcommit it's a
1:03:44
great UL from carrier out the fog of war and at that point it's already too late and now geni are hovering around Dragon
1:03:50
but T won't have the buff this is dangerous yeah exactly Doran over here to the side carrier close to as well and
1:03:56
dor just Dives in the engaged Jace there a chaos storm wreaking havoc and ruler is dead already two of them sent home
1:04:03
but no one dead just yet chovi going to be executed by this gigantic Kaiser k
1:04:10
not enough against Smash and dur going to have to flash to get out of the Way owner chasing after him as Faker will he
1:04:17
be able to land it there it is just a q of course he can land that that one's targeted and Canyon running for the
1:04:23
hills Doran just going to make sure that he cannot test this dragon and maybe he'll just kill him as well the last man
1:04:29
standing on on the side of gen and that could be a clean Ace if they killed him they don't even need to though I mean
1:04:35
smash has just been so good in the clean up but also Doran just charging at ruler deciding I'm just going to jump on you
1:04:41
there's nothing you can do and truth is he's 01 there's nothing can do yeah he's from like the worst start we've ever
1:04:46
seen he's doing so well he's getting so much value on this Jace pick remember it was the first pick and it is paying off
1:04:53
for sure T1 don't actually finish the and they're like hey we're just going to head straight to Bar we'll take that
1:04:58
Canyon has no flash is there with the Smite all right Canyon is not there with a SM not there with the Smite the Smite
1:05:05
is no longer an available thing uh 2,000 Health T1 just being slow with it as
1:05:10
that piercing Arrow not like the others and so that's oner locking down the baron so Baron they deny the wait they
1:05:18
don't actually deny Soul point but that doesn't really matter they got the baron buff now and they might even be able to
1:05:23
push just straight up the lanes and take them down especially with their engage potential off the back of Smash being so
1:05:31
strong this is just a great way to play the team fight with a without the camp but Dar just knows his job just just
1:05:36
kill ruler and he doesn't do all the damage but it results in him going down
1:05:42
then smash here yeah smash going un and then also out playing the king Santa
1:05:48
here as well great flash at the end man so clean so clean honestly this is the
1:05:55
guy you want to be 9 and0 absolutely and he said afterwards that they got it and
1:06:00
we won I don't know whether that means they won the game but he might be on to something to be ice cold 15 to three now
1:06:06
and again like T1 was getting the kills don't get me wrong but geni it felt like they had the edge and what they were getting on the map and the game's just
1:06:12
been blown open 6,000 gold lead Baron and pocket still T1 to apply that pressure close to 3,000 gold the lead
1:06:20
here for just smash alone yeah and really it just we haven't seen that
1:06:25
value in the team fight you know he went they on hit varus so he can get a bit more DPS but it feels like when you're in range to hit like the vi or the Jace
1:06:33
they're in range to hit you and that goes a lot better for them well try could be in trouble here as he does dash back avoids The Vault breaker very
1:06:39
nicely gets a knock up onto oner but they're just going to continue The Siege and they may as well brambles coming on
1:06:44
in and it is going to lock down oner he gets mes there immediately as the UL is going to catch out carrier so he's
1:06:51
likely to go down but Canyon finds himself pretty lonely at the front of this fight ke going to try and tank for
1:06:57
him as Twisted Advance does bring the Jace forward but he's not a Target that you really want to be fighting they need
1:07:03
to try and kill smash who dives into the back line and looks for ruler he goes golden Duro is so close to being okay
1:07:09
but tr's out of there cannot fight anymore a three for three honestly good for geni but they're not going to be
1:07:15
able to keep their base alive they just can't take down smash F gets a mega Arcane storm as well 51 n now the Victor
1:07:22
and chy with no W Duro as well who's super weak at the moment there's no way they can do more T1 get what they want
1:07:28
and still maintain this massive gold Le we see the replay of the fight so I think chovi doing a great job of setting
1:07:34
up plays and then disengaging when he can gets the ult that owner flashes disengage before he gets CC but then T1
1:07:40
are still so strong Canyon can't really get out and eventually the decision is made Canyon you're dead just sacrifice
1:07:46
yourself but we see here in the ins fight chobby commits heavily on the owner and smash flies in takes out ruler
1:07:53
uses Zas able to buy time and even though ke gets a bit of value he's just not doing enough and smash is
1:07:59
shredding him way too quickly and Faker is doing so incredibly well at splitting
1:08:04
up the fight for geneng they're always fighting on multiple fronts because he's using his ultimate to not only do
1:08:10
massive amounts of damage but also Zone them all the way around the perimeter of it and so trovy wasn't able to meet up
1:08:16
with Keen and they could both focus a Target that just wasn't happening um in these fights he now has an infinity edge
1:08:22
so at least ch's going to be doing a bit more damage but just feels like the ship's kind of sailed as far as gen and
1:08:28
being able to take hold of this game once again I feel like Y is one of those Champions where when you don't have
1:08:34
enough damage to shred through him he kind of feels Untouchable he's hard to CC does so much sustain damage he builds
1:08:40
items like a shield bow to have that durability but when you're kind of at this much of a deficit and smash is so
1:08:46
strong you just get annihilated you know you go in and you can't stick in the fight as long as you want to you have to
1:08:52
unbind really quickly at any threat of CC because there so much damage in return you have dor who just so tanky
1:08:58
right now it's so hard to cut through him the fact that smash has the Zas as well and Faker is a seeker's arm guard
1:09:05
it just feels like the outs for geni are getting smaller and smaller in this game uh and I mean the only sort of Silver
1:09:11
Lining is that T1 are quite a while away still from a hex de Soul so I have to concern themselves with that anytime
1:09:17
soon but I don't think the game is getting any easier oh absolutely not especially with Baron up in a minute 50
1:09:24
um of course Dr up a little bit sooner than that but I believe Baron is what T1 are going to be looking for because that could just help them straight up win the
1:09:30
game uh good news for ji is that the inhibitor that they lost was mid lane the easiest kind of to defend as you've
1:09:37
got rer now standing in mid he would have been standing there anyway more likely than uh than not and so geni at
1:09:42
least allowed back onto the map at least a little bit just don't know whether allowed onto the map is that much of a
1:09:49
good thing because every time they go for a fight they lose it's been pretty rough uh the
1:09:54
recent fights really been a struggle and it's I feel like picks obviously would be great but it's kind of hard to get
1:10:00
picks with a composition without fully commit to the fight like a lot of that ult like the varas or the V you want in
1:10:07
the fight itself oh ke going to be able to at least get rid of a bit of that CC
1:10:13
and I mean this is one of the powers of poppy as well is that you can just wind up the Al and just drop it and now K is
1:10:18
going to have it again in like a few seconds just the pressure of threatening that on a keen Tower taken more gold rer
1:10:24
still clearing the wave mid feeling kind of insatable and the question is like if you want to engage
1:10:29
from gen you know malal can be blocked uh both the uh carries enemy team have
1:10:36
stasis very hard to find an angle now Ono will be forced away from this red buff but it's a small consolation prize
1:10:42
yep at least red buff will be able to go over to the team for the next potential fight that does in fact come in Dragon
1:10:48
now spawning as the gravity well goes down and Canyon will be able to just
1:10:53
wander out of it no worries there at all let's see whether there is going to be a fight for this dragon or whether ji will
1:10:58
cut their losses and just fight for the baron which I think is the more immediate threat right now
1:11:04
rer I was thinking is he going yeah I know I know Jonah strong really making sure that we're on our toes here as all
1:11:10
right not a lot of wind up there from car but just says goodbye Keen Sante down goes chovy once again ruler trying
1:11:16
to do his best here as they manag to take down Doran he flashes over but now he's out of the fight Keen just trying
1:11:22
to keep himself alive and yeah goes all out locks on to smash here as best he can but just pops like a balloon good
1:11:29
night gen all of them taking a little bit of a nap here Duro and rer out of
1:11:34
there they may as well just not be participating and T1 looking to end this game number one with a
1:11:41
bang see if gen can try and clear the wave with a super minion I don't think it's going to be possible T1 still have
1:11:47
so much threat Carry has flash will miss positions you can just get wall slammed yeah he has to make sure he stands as
1:11:53
far back as possible gravity well goes down carrier just trying to grab him there's the flash heroic charge that was
1:11:59
gorgeous by carrier his poppy clean as ever and down goes the Nexus but 1304
1:12:06
the young man smash certainly looking still exceptionally good here in the lck
1:12:11
cup smash had a fantastic game and played really well and likely going to be People's Front Runners of p and I 100% agree with that but I think you
1:12:18
have to give credit to all of T1 because everyone really did their role so well own on the buy catching people out like
1:12:24
the before he can buffer and and get away from the CC Doran who had a really rough start bounc back was leading the
1:12:31
charging fights we saw carrier on the poppy having so many good olds Faker dodging everything from yon and just
1:12:37
being that silent carrier just doing so much damage in the backline as smash is a focus this felt like a fiveman unit
1:12:43
who looks really strong and it's rare we see T1 topple gen in the regular season I know it's l K cup it's not the regular
1:12:49
season but this is a really good sign you know I think it was some great play from T1 there and yes smash absolutely
1:12:56
popped off absolutely deserves a praise but all five members deserving of some praise from that one really impressive
1:13:02
stuff looking at Faker massive amounts of damage and for me he's probably front runner for p because every time we saw
1:13:09
Faker on screen he looked fully locked in yeah like avoiding everything he possibly could making sure that all of
1:13:15
the buttons were pressed exactly the way they needed to and that was a difficult game as you can see there around about 22 minutes the game was entirely tied up
1:13:23
any play could have changed one way or the other at that point in time so geni
1:13:29
versus T1 a matchup that never stops delivering and we'll see whether it does again in game number two as we're going
1:13:35
to go to a short break then the space going to break that one down and we'll have game number two see you soon

1:20:13
just a couple guys lounging around after T1 answered the question that everyone's
1:20:19
been asking who's going to start in this game and it is smash he did exactly that against gen G welcome to the space it's
1:20:25
Deon alongside with did and chronicler and one of our most storied rivalries in
1:20:31
all of the lck genen GT1 yet another chapter and this one very very exciting with a lot of caveats here chronicler
1:20:38
yeah from the uh we're going to say it now so we don't have to keep referring to it obviously Duro had a really rough
1:20:43
game but uh most likely he will get subed out is currently quite ill and I
1:20:48
think the Elise pickway made sense in the context of not wanting carer to play that that's basically his ideal Champion
1:20:54
right but it's not a Duro champion and I think it's clear that he's not in a great shape but fortunately the rest of ji
1:21:00
also is not playing up to the level that we wanted and then on the flip side what
1:21:05
did yeah you know you know cuz he he was he was he was uh taunting me cuz I'm a
1:21:11
gen predictor he was like oh chronicler smash is so and guess what smash is so
1:21:17
good he's crazy yeah I me I did mention some of
1:21:22
like X ad carries but now I think T1 is playing so well with new ad carry now
1:21:30
like for example like before you play on Z once again like you play on top side you put resources on the one of the best
1:21:37
top laner in lck but now you have one of the carry style ad carry in the Bol Lane
1:21:42
so you kind of sack Doran and just give free kills on kaisa I think that was
1:21:48
really huge in the all the game and there is a reason why Doran even with
1:21:53
all of the things you always talk about right in high moments sometimes he doesn't keep it together why Doran has
1:21:58
been a multi-time lck champion why he is still very highly regarded by every team
1:22:04
that he plays with and I I honestly think I don't know if smash would have gotten the opportunity if it wasn't for
1:22:10
zus subbing out right but now we're seeing a T1 that uh really as they did
1:22:16
way back in 2022 when it was the hyper carry meta when it was Jinx fresh aellos all the time they just play for bside
1:22:24
and it's working amazingly with smash picking up all these kills yeah uh we are kind of highlighting smash but at
1:22:29
the same time look at the setup from the owner and carrier just helping a little brother to pick up some free kills is
1:22:36
just so amazing and top of that we have to like shout out to Doran once again
1:22:41
like he's just doing nothing on the map but he's just sacking all the pressure from the geni that means a lot and also
1:22:48
he jumps in for the team like no matter what for in the team fight he just jumps in and just making a huge SP space for
1:22:55
the 0 carries it's just so huge impact yeah uh and because they've got that
1:23:00
star player making the plays and picking up the kills geni also filled with star
1:23:06
players and we're going to talk about one of them who hasn't performed to the standard that we're used to here Kon
1:23:11
that's the big thing and I think Faker had an amazing game on the Victor actually played out really cleanly uh Nerfs not bothering him at all but the
1:23:18
reason we're highlighting this is because chovi has played the best yon game that I have seen of all time right
1:23:24
this is a game that b bth the chovy meme this is a player that last spring and I
1:23:29
know we're not technically in Spring you know same time period was hard 1 v9 in the lck and I think that a lot of
1:23:36
players on G G are still figury things out right as lck cup I think they have the time to do so I don't want to really sound any alarm Bells but the reason I
1:23:43
want to highlight it is because we also need to be honest I think right now chovy's form just doesn't looked that good he hasn't been choying he hasn't
1:23:48
really been mechanically nearly as strong as he has been and I think we're starting to see how much geni she was
1:23:54
relying on that it makes sense cuz there's a reason why gen ever since chovi joined in 2022 has been contesting
1:24:00
for like at SEC at worst second in the lck I mean on top of that uh when I do
1:24:05
LC C streaming like there is so many Victor High prior in LC right but uh I
1:24:10
often say that uh in lck it cannot be happen because when you pick Victor you're going to get smashed you're going
1:24:17
to get ganked you're going to get killed on S Side Lane but it didn't happen and also Faker kind of just juked out
1:24:24
chovi and so many gangs From the Canyon so I think just everything kind of mixed up for the T1 really well yeah this was
1:24:31
a great game for T1 I think we could have gone any which way with the ton of the highlights whether it was Doran Staying Alive the side steps by Faker
1:24:38
here's the big team fight that broke the game open after smash was already at four kills just High pone smash once
1:24:45
again like support and jungle player you already know that you know how to grow
1:24:50
up your ad carry but do you remember any like solo random 80 carries like half seven kills just randomly throwing out
1:24:57
but this guy never fails really really well done by Smash and we saw there as well ruler is another piece of the
1:25:04
puzzle that we kind of need to talk about hasn't really been living up to what we expected this player and smash
1:25:11
thus far has had an absolutely insane W set of games that there's a loss in
1:25:17
there as well by the way that was the impressive that was the most impressive game on the asreal you know as a as a
1:25:24
Challen andur T1 has really not been that good ever since they had like the
1:25:29
they had the roach lineup way back and then they had the photon and tolon but
1:25:34
despite that smash has been able to flourish there's a smiling Reckless somewhere as he helped rise up smash to
1:25:42
the player that he is now let's get to it game number two gen vers T1 the story
1:25:47
Line's bound will it continue this amazing run by Smash or will jeni have something to say about it surpris
1:25:54
surprise no substitution here for Gen G they're going to just roll with what they got let's send it on over to the
1:25:59
casters to game number two thank you so much Mr gone and that Duro artwork is
1:26:05
absolutely phenomenal and hopefully that gives him energy moving into this game too no subs or anything like that we're
1:26:11
just getting straight into it you know I've been tracking how many times chronic has mentioned challenges so far in the LSK cup up to 24 already wow
1:26:20
which is pretty low for him um I was going to say I was expecting a much like I was expecting three digits please step
1:26:26
it up 204 all right well I'm going I'm going to write that down we'll keep tabs on it
1:26:32
throughout the day just as we will keep tabs on this draft that we're diving into right now of course felis means
1:26:38
that none of the F five Champions on either side that we saw in game number one will be played let's see what bands we're going to get this time I imagine
1:26:45
like it's always game two that the air bands start coming out we'll see whether that's something that uh T1 or geni are
1:26:51
going to look towards is the Gallo going to be first cab off the ring yeah I came out of draft kind of thinking you know uh T1 uh maybe didn't for me I think
1:27:00
geni had maybe the EDG in draft um but you know T1 now onto red side geni had
1:27:05
side selection there on Blue so should hopefully for ji help the out a little bit in this situation we see the scarner
1:27:12
ban come out and then the ash ban you kind of locked into that CL ban on three
1:27:17
you would think oh T want maybe show the hand a little bit early there you almost have to ban those Champions though with
1:27:24
how good roller is on the ash this means we might see the N open um potenti
1:27:30
for they might leave a lot open like who knows like if you leave NY open do you then get kalista guys you got to
1:27:36
remember Cori now has a win so we can't bully him as two wins two wins it's a 213 type type day and he has himself an
1:27:44
ace machine nly left up let's see whether that is going to be picked here
1:27:49
as we won't need to talk about the ace machine so much anymore uh because he's been banned so thank goodness Aurora
1:27:57
that's going to be the consideration of course especially for Gen very much a flex pick and that is going to be taken
1:28:02
away nocturn stocks Rising I guess you could say but uh I think picking away the N makes a lot of sense on the T1
1:28:09
side it's it's an interesting one because the Aurora is obviously very strong for Gen but it does weaken the N
1:28:14
pick by having presumably an AP solo laner as well still it's not the end of the world definitely could still take it
1:28:20
but T1 immediately going to slam the ezal for smash very confident in that pick for him uh even though it is his
1:28:27
only loss but if you watch the game you know yeah didn't look like a loss for him he did everything he could uh and
1:28:33
more uh still wasn't quite enough for that game but definitely proficient on this Champion now T1 looking to very
1:28:39
early secure his EZ Leona Lane it is a strong Lane and it does put pressure on gen G because you don't have that much
1:28:46
space to respond to a full bot Lane lock in and it looks like they want to make sure they can do that right now so Tyran
1:28:54
we have actually seen Aurora zyan work quite well with the fact that you put down the circle create the Thunderdome
1:29:00
then the feathers are sort of all over the place and you can kind of isolate the fight a little bit that way um Z
1:29:06
gives me anxiety um just in general as a champion uh she just does a lot of losing I feel the problem here is you
1:29:13
know you want people to come into you when you're playing Z as well can just sit at range and fire Mystic shots uh Recon and Leona there's a potential to
1:29:19
get stun locked and taken out there's the is and also you know Aurora used to really bad in ezel cuz you'd lock
1:29:25
everyone in and Only ezel Could Escape obviously anyone can leave now but ezil can avoid uh have to run through the
1:29:32
wall and you have an air as well so you have really these mobile quite long range picks which I I think gen's comp
1:29:39
is already struggling a bit into what T1 has not to mention I feel like ji's composition is already kind of in a box
1:29:46
right Azia Ezreal Leona you can play them anywhere right and so if you put
1:29:51
whichever top laners uh top plane and jungle that you'd like into this composition it's going to look absolutely fine and so you can plug some
1:29:58
of the holes um as this Draft starts to come together for T1 whereas ji they're
1:30:04
all about like kite back trying to make sure that this zire is able to actually effectively do damage that makes things
1:30:10
a little bit difficult the nocturn band does come in um as they did prioritize locking away their bottom Lane and let's
1:30:17
see what the last ban is going to be here NY taken away from owner and as he does definitely have his license that is
1:30:23
an standable ban oh man this is just so T1 this draft if this Zin gets locked in
1:30:30
it's absurd yeah kind of when you look through the junglers have been banned or denied does stand out as that one uh you
1:30:35
expect them to lean towards question is more where will gen g go uh I mean I guess Theory you could
1:30:43
see Canyon pull out something like the Le in is a possibility yeah uh wouldn't really be a fan of vgo oh no not paper
1:30:51
man yeah uh good look to Top Lane F I mean I do like Jax in general when
1:30:56
there's a Zen on the enemy team cuz he just makes his life so difficult Jax zani could work especially with the fact
1:31:02
that raan works with it quite well but um that's a jungle Jax yeah looks like
1:31:08
they're going for the Jungle Jack and again you know the the place you're getting the most benefit from having the Jacks is into zenza so this is going to
1:31:15
be a really favorable jungle match up for Canyon and now toying with the idea of what they want to
1:31:20
play silus uh I'd say old value already pretty good in terms of the Zen high
1:31:27
value for survivability the empress Devi the uh solar FL both pretty nice just gener team fight don't pick I mean I
1:31:34
don't know why he's hovering you're not picking on into silus um maybe you just want more Tru
1:31:41
trains n it's greas it's Darius obviously wow that would make things
1:31:47
difficult for the Aurora but instead he's going to go back to thaton I feel likeon is a very Doran Champion but it
1:31:53
was Z's tank like that is the tank that Z played so it feels very T1 uh this
1:31:58
particular draft um even if it is Smash andoran playing and not their world
1:32:03
championship roster from last year still feels the same way the big standups to me is you want to avoid interacting with
1:32:11
the Enemy jungle as much as possible when it comes to T1 uh and you have a swap situation that heavily favors you
1:32:18
with the scon into an aurora s is going to be much more valuable so T1 are going to swap that is absolute fact and we're
1:32:25
going to see how much value they get from that and what geni do in response do they try and match the swap do they try and Scout them out cuz normal Lanes
1:32:32
is what geni would absolutely desire seen teams struggle to find that uh and
1:32:37
if T won get the swap off I I think they're in a really comfortable position he's um he's not as much of a
1:32:43
chill guy as you may have expected as it turns out so many memes combined so many memes
1:32:54
behind he's like I'm just a chilled guy it's okay but ji lost the first game yeah oh my God that's actually such a
1:33:00
good meme so good so good some of the I mean it's obviously drawn great but also just creative yeah yeah brilliant stuff
1:33:07
all right so that's going to give jeni a little bit of extra power M moving into this game and they're going to need it
1:33:12
against what uh T1 have put together for this one right now looking at me like a bit of a two but we'll see where the Gen
1:33:18
can find their footing here in game number two [Music]
1:33:29
[Music]
1:33:37
all right the eruption of the T1 fans coming in as the robot scon heads towards the Top Lane but I don't know
1:33:43
whether he's going to stay there for long as you can see heading back now going to keep his options open not a
1:33:50
whole lot of vision available here for geni as we uh can see in the enemy jungle you know there's some connections
1:33:57
here right oh yeah Doren teamates with smash uh smash used to play with Reckless Reckless now playing with the
1:34:05
bous the Scion specialist just a couple of phone calls away you know that is
1:34:10
true there is not that many degrees of separation it's like only seven or eight very
1:34:15
surprising considering how many that's a friend of a friend territory right there really is really is that's a believable
1:34:22
story you know it's like I actually know the guy who knows the guy you know yeah
1:34:27
brilliant all right well we'll have to see from doran's play whether he has been uh studying the Lost
1:34:35
returns so we see a situation where thoran is helping owner to start clearing the jungle but it ends up being
1:34:42
match Lanes in the bot Lane with the Leona Ezreal into the zyon which I mean
1:34:48
that 2v2 part is fine um not sh have T1 which one I maybe
1:34:54
see if geni going to match the swap they could end up going for like a fourman die bot I've seen this before where
1:35:00
theion tanks and the scon dies and then his passive helps with the dive very possible this could really hear geneng G
1:35:07
and it looks like that's the strategy they're going for maybe the friend of the friend thing maybe it happened yep
1:35:13
because doran's still here teleport is immediately going to be invested by Keane T1 still looking for it though
1:35:18
it's going to be a four versus three is the knock up going to be interrupted Doran already tanking is's okay with
1:35:24
doing that they take first blood and now Kean trying to get what he can done
1:35:30
carrier still chasing after Keen Duro left on his own underneath this turret the rest of T1 holding on to the minion
1:35:36
wave and if Duro is picking up these minions it still feels pretty good here for T1 as Canyon moving into the enemy
1:35:42
jungle trying to make the most of a bad situation you see great hold of the way his never mind feels like the enemy
1:35:48
jungle with what they've been doing as all right rer running on over they do have information as as there's the flash
1:35:54
just doesn't really get much done grand entrance going to still knock up carrier who has to flash away no turret ramp
1:35:59
available so he's going to be all right so in the end one for one first Blood going over to T1 but that doesn't matter
1:36:05
anymore um as much outside of the gold that they picked up you can see that
1:36:10
ultimately it had its desired effect in terms of putting a lead between the carries but geni had a really good
1:36:16
response the immediate TP from Keen they smelled something was up they expected this uh able to mitigate what the dive
1:36:24
could have been yes ruler still goes down yes he justes miss a fair bit of farm but this could have been so much
1:36:29
worse and you see the strategy thoran is like right I'm going to take aggro first doesn't get the full charge Cube because
1:36:34
J said in TR he just doesn't care about dying they manag to kill ruler and then
1:36:39
they were trying to look for an angle with the passive but Keen just walks out a turret and they don't really have anything to follow him right
1:36:45
now in hindsight maybe if they gone for J could be it's hard to say um they kind of lost the momentum there but it was
1:36:52
the initial dive obviously was the desired effect but geni doing a great job of responding and now they have a
1:36:57
lead in the top side uh and rer is starting to catch up she was able to
1:37:02
hold the wave a little bit there and now we've kind of returned to the swap uh which you know we thought T1 would go
1:37:07
for in the first place oh got to teleport in from trovy will make his way over Faker still
1:37:14
at 300 health just looking for a little bit of a better back timing I guess right now pretty decent wave position
1:37:20
for the silus we have to remember that as far as Zia players are concerned and um ruler is relatively good I hear he's
1:37:25
got a skin on the champion and stuff like that that being said he was playing the the uh Z at a period of time where
1:37:32
she was pretty busted um that was basically Zia Kaiser
1:37:38
every game wasn't it yeah yeah pretty much uh not quite in that level now as she was before but did get some nice ad
1:37:45
carry I change as I'm saying that just got back to Lane yeah not having a fun time I feel like it's one of those
1:37:50
things where when you're into the silus as some like a Zia lose the trade so badly and then you try to make up for it
1:37:56
afterwards oh the flash actually has to be invested trovy taking a turret shot still feeling okay in the lane but now
1:38:01
no flash no teleport and no real way to get back into this Lane so even though the Cs right now is even trovy should be
1:38:08
able to find himself a decent advantage and I think choby also felt that he didn't have a very good game one he is
1:38:14
uh he's he's he's locking in pretty hard I said in game one that Faker downloaded chovi chovi got a firmware update and
1:38:20
he's he's now ahead of the kill it's it's an arms right CH connecting those chains two times in
1:38:25
a row really get some good trades on a faker and providing some pressure Kane looking for an opportunity
1:38:31
here under smash doesn't find the combo I mean he's level five uh he's about halfway to level six but that Al is such
1:38:38
a huge power Spike smash already half HP you have to be a little bit careful I'd
1:38:43
be you'd feel a lot safer playing into the zire than you are playing into the Aurora uh smash right now Keen is
1:38:49
feeling very safe though just walking in the melee range of Leona in a 1 V2 did of course have dur relatively close by
1:38:56
you can see he's not too worried about how this game is going ret should be a little bit worried as laning up against
1:39:01
Doran right now but there was a zenzal lurking as we can see going to be distracted a little bit by this dragon
1:39:07
is okay Faker No Emperor divide just yet chovy could steal his away as he did
1:39:12
just ding it's crazy just that the chain don't hit that connect with the minions there and still chovy is doing so much
1:39:18
damage again fer answers back but the problem is if you keep trading this way where like chobi gets a good trade then
1:39:23
you reduce his health to about the same you're going to run out Health First that's how it's going to go um as we saw
1:39:30
before with the flash there's no one here feel like that's relatively
1:39:35
valuable here for Kane yeah kind of get some adjusted Lane assignments here from T1 um did end up picking up the dragon
1:39:43
kind of maybe get away from the Aurora on the top side but Keen is just really being snowballed heavily by this this is a sacrifice when you go for that play
1:39:49
with d on the bot Lane you are giv up on top a little bit you know that D's be behind uh and and I think ultimately the
1:39:56
payoff hasn't been as big as they'd hope see that's difference between Smash and rul very tiny and because we got so much
1:40:01
solo XP he's actually up in levels compared to smash so definitely a
1:40:06
backfire here 4 T1 and what was their intended plan yeah kind of nutty but we remember game number one the early game
1:40:13
looked really good for geni and honestly their macro decisions where they were moving on the map everything was good it was how they were playing together and
1:40:20
the micro interactions that they weren't able to navigate as well as T1 it felt like T1 were just doing buttons
1:40:26
better the team fighting from T1 was ruthless um honestly and also where the
1:40:31
gold went but you know we have keen on a carry now his chance to make the most of that almost thousand gold lead he has
1:40:38
already in this game and most CS in the game as well uh only by five now but it
1:40:43
was looking pretty crazy earlier on so this Aurora could be a problem it technically wasn't a swap but when you
1:40:49
have these weird Shenanigans Top Lane you're so used to the Top Lane it's just having no Farm uh and then Keen just
1:40:54
just kind of vibing I mean this is what geni want you know you don't pick Aurora so you can end up famished in a swap situation yep uh and they've ended up
1:41:01
here we've also seen Canyon have a bit of an edge in terms of jungle Cs and again that's another situation where T1
1:41:09
are a bit weak in that jungle match up because if you see Jax fight Zena it's not a fight no it's not very fair uh
1:41:16
counter- strike does relatively well for Champions that can Empower Auto attacks yeah not bad no kidding yeah no I'm I've
1:41:24
been commentating this game for quite some time i' I've learned about the Zin out Jack interactions it's taken me a
1:41:30
few years you know but you got there yeah I got there in the end that's the main thing as Doran just getting abused here by Keane who's taken the grasp as
1:41:36
well we've seen that was uh maybe that's the tech that allowed anivia to be a top laner obviously Aurora another F aian
1:41:43
Champion going to be even more suited because she was already a top laner yeah and he he is just annihilating dor right
1:41:49
now and especially if he ends up going to LeAndre is going to hurt so much taking more play in the situation don't have to TP back back top to defend thing
1:41:57
is as well geni only have three grubs yeah you're never going to be able to get grub pressure if if the game continues like this well we saw last
1:42:03
time J A to get a whole bunch of grubs and it did absolutely nothing to the outcome of the game so T1 fans I would
1:42:09
not stress just yet especially with the fact that Faker is playing the Sandy pigeon and here's AIA has gotten T1 out
1:42:17
of even rougher situations than this in the past we'll see whether it can do that again yeah specifically against
1:42:22
there was this 8 har I don't know if you know him he was in the LPL for a while wasn't the at first um yeah I seem to
1:42:29
remember something about that I do remember the same ad carry doing it to Faker although he wasn't playing this Champion as oh Duro that is not where
1:42:37
you want to be standing that's said pigeon picking up a kill as well you know it kind of feels like the plot of
1:42:43
his series From duro's perspective is he's just being picked on uh he want have targeted him heavily they do so
1:42:50
again this is one of the things when you're playing raan the cc's which he was there beautifully by carrier you are
1:42:55
squishy you can be locked down this is why you know a a lot of times Luna was picked into raon specifically a rude
1:43:03
that's rude well at least he doesn't have Turtle Port anymore does upgrade that to an actual teleport so that means
1:43:10
that at least he'll be able to get to Lane relatively fast but instead he elects to stick around for another wave and duro yeah wanders up on a Ward and
1:43:18
sometimes you're just not allowed to do that car does the ER combo where when they're still rooted by e get the AL
1:43:23
down just beautifully done leaves no time for you to sort of cuz when you e and then go for the Q sometimes you
1:43:28
conquer W in time this leaves no opportunity for that uh and jro doesn't
1:43:34
have M Treads or anything yet so and you still get to que afterwards still get to afterwards like so much same duration
1:43:40
all right Empress divide it's all over the place is now trovy looking to try and make his way out of underneath the turret carrier turns up D here as well
1:43:47
that might give chovy the opportunity to get in there Faker once again has to flash and that is going to be a success
1:43:53
full gank there from Duro onto chovy's Lane nicely done no Emperor divides left
1:43:59
as we can see in that mid lane very funny it kind of feels like in an anime or something when they just use the exact same move other equal impact but
1:44:07
uh good moves from jro there to punish Faker afterwards and get that sumoner spell and now R looking for smash yeah
1:44:12
carrier is here play is going to get a a snare bit not too much more than that yeah right window where you can really
1:44:18
get up time on the Ed oh nice able actually get out of it this time but could be a little bit of an opportunity
1:44:24
as the quickness does come down big cool down invested here by D but keeps himself alive this time I think rer just
1:44:29
not quite in range from to be able to E2 and and that's one of the things as well with the EQ you can just ult when
1:44:35
carrier goes in and stop it carrier fishing a bit with that ult but doesn't find it now yep so try oh actually going
1:44:41
to get a stop onto carrier's recall Duro in position as well as now Keen moving over carrier I think he knows that he's
1:44:47
not going to stand too much of a chance here as the UL is going to be invested in Kean going to pay a visit to the Leon
1:44:53
takes a little bit of time but he gets there in the end as now Faker with no flash having to deal with chovy there's no ulti there as well all he can do is
1:45:00
try and shift some Sands but these sand soldiers are doing so much work the chain lash not going to connect and
1:45:06
finally some buttons come off cool down and trovy finishes off the pigeon solo kill for the man of the mid lane for Gen
1:45:12
solo Lane is coming up big for J chovy kind of waiting for cool Downs there was a little bit awkward yeah it felt a
1:45:17
little bit like there was maybe a chance but he's like give me a second give me a second gets the rotation back able to take him out Dragon picked up by geni
1:45:24
and you know we felt like kills were going in favor of T1 in game one but the objectives in favor of geni I feel like
1:45:30
even more so this time and they have the kill lead as well things are looking really positive we did see Doran get
1:45:36
some alone time top and get some plates but ultimately Keen gets a roome that has a lot of value for him and the feat
1:45:43
of strength picked up for geni now there's a cloud Soul on the map
1:45:49
as well trying to hold in my excitement um um you can be excited it's okay it's
1:45:54
always T1 games man T1 is so reliable when it comes to Cloud souls and you know what you've been Vindicated because
1:46:00
right on nerfing cloud they said it's the strongest one it's the highest win rate that's what
1:46:07
I'm talking about as yep try just finds the Leona
1:46:12
here and and now he says dead and he gives the kill over to
1:46:19
Kee he's like I'm going to go kill mid LAN and in he
1:46:25
goes cover me please is what he's saying everyone's coming on over and you can see the king Slayer
1:46:32
coming back off and there it is L chains Lance W all good cool Comon collected
1:46:38
and an emperor divide going to get rid of him once again as the ulti comes down from trovy Baker going down so low the
1:46:44
double guards are looking real crazy there as owner does manage to take down trovy in the end Canyon trying to fight
1:46:50
this one out as the train um that was not really the station he wanted dur going to try and get a knock up here and
1:46:56
uh Doran is pretty heavy but he's not going to do a whole lot of damage and in the meantime kean's still Top Lane and
1:47:01
so he's going to be able to grab a feet of strength and jeni will get all of them yeah that was the first time we saw the Jax interact with Zeno and dear I
1:47:10
think the smash show is now starting as feather storm going to come down we'll see if this blade caller can actually do
1:47:15
anything at all and in fact it does a whole lot trop barage gets the flash the rer still had somehow and now smash
1:47:22
walking into the wall he is very very low Duro goes in looking for dor but he's very tanky battle dance
1:47:27
will get himself out so Q just barely misses needs a few more URS on that one and Kean not going to be able to lock
1:47:34
too much down but no one dies in that particular part of the exchange yeah able to dis engage there we see the replay and as I was saying this is the
1:47:41
first time we've seen the Jackson in out interact for owner sake I hope it's the last because you know the initial play
1:47:48
he comes in he just ch the chain doesn't Comm NE but there's just nothing he can do owners like okay s's coming I can go
1:47:54
back in and Canyon just presses e and then just Bonks him and oh man not much
1:48:00
you can do and it's so easy to play into as well you see audacious charge and
1:48:06
then you're like oh I guess I press e now yeah and then he can't do anything he can't even get out so guaranteed gets
1:48:12
done the thing yeah this is back to life and okay tic coming on down there as
1:48:17
Canyon is going lower and lower the AIA certainly takes care of him and so Canyon Maybe not as Immortal as we
1:48:23
thought it's emper div going to connect Faker thrown back towards ruler is now chovy one versus three great knock up
1:48:29
there from Duro is the emperess Divide almost manages to get this one done but oh my God smash able to get out the DPS
1:48:36
and they win the fight yeah I think Canyon heard what I said oh oh dear that
1:48:42
one landed is now ruler does he have the blade caller the anwers almost as smash manages to get the auto and keeps
1:48:48
himself alive I thought that was a smash mad movie once again but not quite enough rare smash Miss there on the
1:48:56
Mystic shot at the end ruler dodging away able to make it competitive proving that he's human yes is what we needed to
1:49:02
see we've learned that now yeah Canyon you know you block everything oner does you block the stun from carrier I think
1:49:09
he heard what I said and was just feeling himself a bit too much um on also getting the knock up at the end
1:49:15
when he try to LEAP strike out little bit over zealous and this this passage you play it's not ultimately that bad
1:49:20
for Gen but considering the advantage they have it's kind of just a one after the other situation and you look at how
1:49:26
low oh my God one get Kean must be feeling so bothered after that because they were lined up he was out of vision
1:49:34
All Things Considered really geni shouldn't be fighting in a way where T1 can get that much of Advantage no T1
1:49:40
played it well credit to them but yeah geni was strong and I think they got far too ahead of themselves in that
1:49:46
situation well that means six all as far as the kills are concerned as Keen this
1:49:52
is a bit of a worry I don't know about that solar play that was not really the one as Faker is going to take a trip out
1:49:57
of this one D will be able to deter the rest of T1 but now with this uh Rift
1:50:04
Herald making a visit to mid lane that could be just double charges I don't know what cion supposed to be able to do about this y they only have to Pilot it
1:50:11
they can just let it go looking for T1 here for Manning the Grump as if it was a neutral objective Canyon we learn from
1:50:18
last time so it's three people that he might be okay with and he is even going to be able to steal away the Grump
1:50:24
that's so sad they invested four people in taking that grp oh but he's focused on the true objective securing the Dragon cloud Soul yep on the way uh
1:50:33
still a while to go yet but he he knows what he needs I mean to be F Cloud Soul
1:50:38
pretty insane with raan oh yeah and a lot of these Champions so Cloud Soul as
1:50:44
well with silus how does it work do you get like a a boost when you hijack an ultimate and then when you use said
1:50:50
hijacked ultimate like where does it take effect I don't actually 100% know that's there's so many silus interactions that
1:50:56
I just don't understand properly yeah I know some Champions you can do that where you can like Cloud soul with like
1:51:02
the initial cast yeah multiple ways is okay blast cone taken by both trovy and owna as they're challenging each other
1:51:09
as you can see here because Troy has stolen away that Crescent guard yeah I mean honestly there's some alss where
1:51:15
you obviously love the offensive ult for chovi like we saw D hovering the the or
1:51:21
chovy would love an or Al but You know despite it being primarily defensive the Z so much value for this Champion who's
1:51:27
already notoriously difficult to kill and into a composition where the main damage turn on you is Smash and Faker
1:51:32
who who don't want to be in meley range of you the value is pretty massive um
1:51:38
going to be gone home I think the Highlight was that away the avoiding the Red's like don't you dare walk through
1:51:44
there uh-huh good support yeah smash is going to move in uh you've got another
1:51:49
support that's going back as well as he does get the information that the red was taken high value and W there as well I
1:51:58
mean it it's a deep Ward but also he has the he has the uh ruin the Deep board
1:52:05
you can see it has four so it's a deep deep it's a very it's a very deep deep Ward one of the deepest Wards we've seen
1:52:11
yeah I've never seen a ward deeper than that outside of any Ward that's deeper than that um but like like apart from
1:52:18
that never seen one all right try up here towards top side own was thinking
1:52:23
about going for a little bit of a gank Duro in the area just picking up some uh blood roses bloody roses where K doesn't
1:52:32
really do damage to D anymore and Doran doesn't deal damage to Kean really and
1:52:38
they've both just got grasp Stacks all over the place ke with a whole a little bit now oh and look that Soul furnace
1:52:44
Shield so big the the like the lane was so interactive and now he's actually
1:52:50
down to 50% this is kind there turret does he have into a train
1:52:56
that would be so sad if he had to into a train against just a bunny rabbit there's the Q that's going to try and
1:53:02
buy him some space but look at this continuing to walk there oh man took a while he flashed and altered to get out
1:53:09
of that okay so we've learned if Doran is there for like 25 seconds then yes
1:53:15
kill him well dur also could just be dead as another Mystic shot going to go wide but gets the heal out of Duro I
1:53:21
mean this is just how smash play as last time but he's so aggressive at finding Windows to punish oh yeah and stepping
1:53:26
up uh hasn't got rewarded you know when he did it on ruler does get a Summoner there from Duro but just a confidence
1:53:33
you know I I feel like especially when you are a rookie player you're subbing into this story roster and they're
1:53:38
playing against gen uh he's just playing the same unfazed playes off doesn't
1:53:45
care well let's have a look at how this arakan fight does go they are trying to
1:53:51
move gravitate I guess towards the top side of the map on T1 but now going for a reset looks like it's ji that should
1:53:58
be able to get there if they would like to teleports available from both top laners and mid laners oh and which which
1:54:03
other is it is it oh it's the oh is it a voracious one one interesting thank
1:54:09
goodness for the buff cuz I really wanted to see more vicious as all right our Canyon demonstrating that whole
1:54:15
zinzow versus Jack situation that we have uh here in this game actually not
1:54:20
doing too bad when it becomes lightning doing a fair bit there we're moving closer and closer to two items for
1:54:26
canyon on this ja and owner does have his already so in actually a pretty good position Doran
1:54:33
just looking a little bit silly there channeling the blind q and Keane with a level Advantage feeling absolutely
1:54:39
fantastic on this Aurora upgrades the shoes as well utilizing these Feats of
1:54:44
Strength and now Duro looking for an opportunity yeah you can see gen working really hard to push their Vision deeper
1:54:49
you know they like that deep War they had earlier they want to do more of that wo a deeper Ward than the deepest Ward you've ever seen that's crazy as fake is
1:54:56
going to be slowed down and that means that he can shift some sand to get himself out of there yeah took some time but they finally got control of that
1:55:01
bush next to Raptors and now just going to be able to push in look for this Tower but they see Dar moving over the
1:55:06
two shop R comes through he want do a good job of mitigating this very much just back and forth though just trying to establish this Vision here and I
1:55:15
imagine a lot of people are like looking at this game feeling like gen is in complete control and they are but I still think that this is anyone's game
1:55:22
and T1 demonstrated in game number one that it doesn't really matter how the vibe of the game is going they can
1:55:28
always just turn it on a dime so jji going to have to stay locked in if they want to make this one happen we'll see
1:55:33
adakan was a point of uh of issue for jeni to say the least in game number one
1:55:39
so you can understand why they're a bit apprehensive to go for it now I feel like it's just a core characteristic you know you can switch out the Top Lane you
1:55:44
can switch out the Ed carry T1 always just has the ability to turn on at the DI uh and it used to be 20 minutes and
1:55:51
now it's 25 minutes for some reason as well big Nerf T1 oh no it's it's a big buff to game
1:55:58
time game duration true they do need to refine a little bit um and maybe work on
1:56:03
the random adakan start I think I think they could do well with that I don't know whether that was a chain that choby
1:56:10
really wanted to uh to land sometimes you just throw a skill shot it's yeah you kind of hesitant cuz you're like I
1:56:15
don't know if I want this to land oh ruler this is so aggressive what's he doing here this is crazy well Kee is
1:56:21
going to find the Ang rer gets out of there carrier stunned up momentarily as empress divide throws ruler away he
1:56:27
survives for a fair while in he's still alive owner gets over there finishes the job but honestly why why was he there
1:56:35
The Counter Strike was decent carrier going down so low it's Duro that's able to lock him down but now chovi is
1:56:40
missing it's only Keen left for the damage and smash is of and available and
1:56:46
so now all of them are taking so much damage from owner Keen has to sacrifice
1:56:51
himself there's nothing he could do and why ruler that wasn't even the ruler spot he was even deeper I have no
1:56:57
answers to the question uh he just completely out of position T1 pounce immediately and just as we're talking
1:57:03
about the ability to turn a game at any situation rulet gives them a bit of a freebie the fight still somewhat close
1:57:10
credit to the rest of gen for making it close but uh huh I I have no
1:57:15
idea okay every Summoner burn for the start of the fight uh smash does respect
1:57:22
flash away from the feathers and to be fair rer survives for a long time here kills Baker not quite the same as that
1:57:29
shuffle we all know from world but but that's the spot that's actually where uh
1:57:34
ruler killed Faker I'm pretty sure in that 2017 final and Faker getting some
1:57:39
Revenge yeah and you can see Keen trying to look to smash the end plane very respectfully D Duro is out of there he's
1:57:46
I was about to say dead I'm going to be honest I was going to say dead it's Trisha barrage searching for it thanks Jonah strong oh ban reaction oh the
1:57:54
Dodge comes through some sick reactions there from Duro sick reactions get it uh it's
1:58:00
pretty good one anyway uh trophy going to be clearing out a Ward and rer not
1:58:05
the ruler spot okay let's not do it they do have Vision Now set up normally it's
1:58:11
supports who die for control WS every support M has done it who normally it's ruler yeah I feel like he's he's back in
1:58:17
the lck and we're back to his old ways he wants to do it he's there for his team you know he knows
1:58:22
wasn't feeling that well he's like I got it buddy I'll play this control to you nailed it well jji retaining there gold
1:58:29
lead it's not too much of a big deal I guess as T1 remember T's composition it
1:58:34
ages kind of beautifully you know they've got the Classic front line lots of DPS like this team should be able to
1:58:41
team fight extraordinarily well as the game goes on I meanon is getting just so tanky and still yeah Keen yes can do
1:58:47
damage with enough time with LeAndre but in fights especially when you look at ruler's build he's not going ldr yeah
1:58:54
where is the ldr so it is going to be a long time before you're able to cut through this Sion who's got you know
1:59:00
Thorn mail and an ending Despair and then in the meantime he's causing such a rockus keeping smash so healthy in these
1:59:08
fights making it so much easier for him to play around not to mention Faker as well as trovy throws out a solar flare just for fun it's probably running out
1:59:16
of uh its duration yeah I'm not too sure on the blood decision um yeah I guess
1:59:21
concerned about the pro from the eal and the a obviously if he lands like a soldier on you but it really does delay
1:59:28
when this Z is going to take over cuz know you're thinking about iie thinking about ldr these items are just so far
1:59:34
away and you need both of them to feel really good about how this game going but that'll be six items that'll mean
1:59:40
that this game is absolutely gone the distance Doran will have approximately 18 billion Health um that's an
1:59:47
approximate number it might be more might be less it could be more I've seen some very Panky sence in my time yeah
1:59:56
slightly worrying but also I'm worried about the age of this adakan it's like the oldest adakan we've ever seen things
2:00:03
are getting super dangerous cuz not only do we have Baron up and adakan we also have soul V gen 50 seconds and it is the
2:00:09
highest win rate in Solo Soul yeah um is cloud Soul verified by ryot they are
2:00:15
nerfing it cuz it's the highest win rate so you know that's to you Cloud Soul haters this Aon is going to start
2:00:20
putting pressure on his have children you know like really wanting to be a grandparent he's getting to that stage light yeah he's really getting to that
2:00:27
point just don't listen to him and let's just play the video game can be distracting sometimes but it's okay they
2:00:33
just want what's best to you is truly the most voracious out of can it's like guys I'm vicious I'm here to make you
2:00:38
have some action I give you a buff so you can just you know now sit down let's have a cup of tea please fight please
2:00:45
that's all I'm asking for geni get the memo but uh different objective no no
2:00:50
they decide against it okay well uh truly the most vicious out of
2:00:56
indeed well Carri is slightly out of position I guess you could say as ruler standing his ground here in this mid
2:01:02
lane does have that blood thirster as the cleanse comes down the train going to get the ulti out at least that button
2:01:09
not going to be there F looking for the angle where he can but Doran tanking up for not a lot of value and Keen keeping
2:01:15
them all into position I think gen G should just take the win back away as Doran will need to reup that health bar
2:01:21
no flash now for the next engage but honestly I think this could be carrier
2:01:27
they need to get need TP him back the question is can they punish ruler he's now got no ult no cleanse if they can
2:01:33
capitalize on that it could be big well immediate CC onto Doran as he does come back there's so much Mobility on this
2:01:40
gen roster it's hard to hold them in place here for T1 as trovy with that solar flare might be able to make something happen Q not going to land as
2:01:47
Doran gets seen Soul Forge comes up he is going to be all right so Genji now over towards this Cloud soul that they
2:01:54
can get for themselves and these T1 health bars are getting lower and lower Flash in from carrier doesn't find any joy in the train misses the station the
2:02:01
knock up is going to interrupt the que as well it's a bit of a disaster as Duro gets the quickness finds the double
2:02:07
knockup and they will be able to take the soulle point as well trovy finding some Dash Cannon value is now Keen
2:02:13
dashing forward owner taking down solo as Canyon darting in and out of the fight they lose no one Doran goes down
2:02:20
they get the soul and values there for Gen just feels like skill shots W connecting from T1 they were looking but
2:02:27
wouldn't find it and now everyone on gen so mobile so fast with that buff it's going to be even harder to connect
2:02:33
fishing yeah he wants to find that huge emperess divide angle he finds it on to two down goes carrier down goes owner
2:02:40
and that should be a ticket to Baron here for jeni you just see what he's locking the fact he's just running so
2:02:45
fast so hard to deal with him geni they get what they want they managed to find the picks on the back end and now Baron
2:02:53
they could just pick a boat yeah this Baron should definitely go down especially without owner available no
2:02:59
teleport D to get himself back there as well even though he's coming back up very very soon and carry a 10 seconds before he's going to be alive again true
2:03:07
shop that was close does get information as well there for smash so nicely done
2:03:13
man that was so exceedingly close yeah I mean good Smite from Canyon but now yeah
2:03:19
double bubs going to be so hard for T1 and we see ker looks for the stun on a
2:03:24
chy doesn't quite find it good Dash from him Doren doesn't connect with the old and then the turn around play comes
2:03:30
through D just getting it's slow right they're not shredding him but eventually he goes down I think te doing a lot of
2:03:35
the damage there and then this uing play he just runs so fast you can see in
2:03:41
the screen like 500 movement speed normally it's Absol yeah Cosmic drive as
2:03:48
well y divide and he just walked at them he's like yeah they pushed up too far
2:03:54
let's go them yeah pretty strong okay you see the last coming last whisper
2:04:00
coming in now for ruler are building towards the armor pen but geni so they got Cloud Soul really fast really hard
2:04:05
to deal with that way they got Baron for the pushing and even if you try and fight them they have adakan it kind of feels like a Checkmate here I mean
2:04:12
they've got Exodia plus right like of course they can't have true exod Exodia because Elder isn't up for another 5
2:04:19
minutes sorry 4 minutes but I mean they got Aon buff they've got Cloud Soul they have upgraded shoes they have six grubs
2:04:26
they've got everything as Kee is demonstrating what they're able to do with that which is basically whatever
2:04:32
they want Crescent guard not guarding too much of anything at all as dur is going to take a quick trip home ERS
2:04:39
divide throws chovy underneath the turret as Canyon Dives in they take down fer before he can react as chovy Splash
2:04:44
on top of Smash will be able to take him down and remember he cannot even die blade Cola value and we are going to
2:04:52
three games we're getting exactly what we wanted out of geni versus T1 here in the lck cup one Nexus turret remains
2:05:00
they've got out of com off but they will not even need to really utilize it because the Nexus is just dead and
2:05:06
thankfully ji are able to buy us a third game and more of this amazing League of Legends much cleaner game from geni felt
2:05:13
like they didn't give over as much opportunities to T1 but some great play from keen and the Aurora get a lot of
2:05:18
value there Canyon also the the Jack jungle pick so much power and I think
2:05:23
chovi locked in on this one I think chovy like heard what chronic was saying
2:05:29
there on the space so I'm hoping that when we do get to the space after the break that Chronicle will watch what he
2:05:34
says because now he knows that trov is listening and uh he definitely played so
2:05:39
much better there in that game finding exactly the angles that they're looking for so hats off to him and now T1 back
2:05:46
onto the blue side once again I think that with how this Series has been coming together a very good chance the
2:05:52
T1 do just take this one home but now we have to remind everyone those tiebreaker scenarios that we were talking about
2:05:58
keep in your it was it 55 or was it 35 it was it was a very specific 18 minute
2:06:05
number um if T1 wins at that much yeah so 18 minutes and 35 seconds if it's un
2:06:12
if it's exactly that then it's a tiebreaker so that's what we have to look out for I think then it would be a
2:06:18
21 for T1 and it's already no no so if geneng G wins yeah but what time was their win cuz they've already had their
2:06:23
win oh they've had their win so their win has to be at 18 minutes and 35 and I think it was way longer than that so never mind that has sail time for us to
2:06:30
go to a short break I'll get my brain back together we'll have the space and then we'll have game number three we'll see you soon

[Music]
2:08:43
that edge of KN is so important to deal with is now hug on a flank angle they haven't dealt with the wave just yet
2:08:51
this there flanks upon flanks flanks W is crashing as well did they go yeah
2:08:57
Morgan's making his way around the ulti comes down from closer huk misses the que though as KZ goes in closer is the
2:09:02
one in trouble but he lands the combo and it does so much damage cuz has to flash for it has now docked on on top of
2:09:09
hype docked on maybe the hero for KT has Morgan in the river by himself now
2:09:15
H picked up by B
2:09:23
what can they find can they get on top of Las remember Rich does not have a
2:09:28
spash angle here on a dooo but sponge is kind of going for a walk on the left side he's so tanky though youal again he
2:09:35
going to fight the front line massive Oriana ultimate but it's just there's no followup he catches a lot but the DPS
2:09:42
isn't there DRX are too far ahead and newal has put on a show once again
2:09:54
he's got hiss in the wrong position yeah I'm like everybody except way is having a pretty good time he's sacrificing
2:10:00
himself right so that's why uh yeah I mean all of KT can never perform at the same time that would not be KT at all
2:10:08
yeah okay that oh even gets the does he die
2:10:15
yeah because yeah smash just chases him down has the extra movement speed from the Inspire and it is so D like this is
2:10:23
this should be just bar the EV blow of this fight though you
2:10:30
can see now Morgan moving in spots the teleport might see that this is the time magnastorm this time finally working up
2:10:35
the polymorph is gorgeous on Morgan into the back line he stunned forever but he still has access to that Counter Strike
2:10:42
and he's still going to be feared
2:10:52
against in there four people with the ultimate and now Hy can you do it can
2:10:58
you be the Savior can you be the flash is so [Music]
2:11:05
good now they're pushing into the river Still Standing what doesn't kly makes stronger gen on the dragon ocean so
2:11:13
points I said they wouldn't fight over it they're all going all in kosi knocking up everybody but he's super low
2:11:19
and kak in the backline is toally F but just got here and now it's a 5v5 but everybody on this the kick is massive
2:11:27
from Canyon but it might not matter Dudu in the backline not able to quite do enough
2:11:34
damage but pan as well still alive full health but he doesn't have a front line anymore the knockup comes in and pan so
2:11:42
sad for him he gets knocked
2:11:50
down e

2:13:37
these geni T1 series used to be two o's nothing to see here but lately they've been huge huge battles exactly what we
2:13:44
saw in game two as geneng G battle back to tie it on up as Chi also heard what
2:13:49
chronicler was saying earlier like said welcome back to the space Deon alongside W did and crony and what do you have to
2:13:56
say this time cronnie that's what I want I mean I I want chovi to be great right
2:14:02
that's good when we have good midlaners the region looks better as a whole and chovi uh credit what credit is D that
2:14:08
silus game was a million times better I think him and Keen uh who Keen funly enough I think in a bit more of a Subway
2:14:15
syus is so in your face but also having an insane Aurora game ended up dragging ji back in this series still think Duro
2:14:22
is struggling a little bit but given the circumstances that's to be expected really great performance by ji just in
2:14:28
general but also I think T1 had great lead early lead from their bolt dive but
2:14:34
after that it didn't quite uh age well after that moment yeah uh again the
2:14:40
early game was a big part of it and even in game number one we saw how uh it stayed close throughout until the big
2:14:46
Aon fight this one a little bit different though cronnie and for for me one of the things that has made geni
2:14:53
such an insanely difficult team to face and we haven't really seen that much of this far with the new roster is their
2:14:59
ability to outpace their opponent in Tempo without getting kills they are I think the best team when they're playing
2:15:05
well we saw this last year at MSI as well it just generating small laning leads and then turning that into objective after objective after
2:15:11
objective particularly in a lane swap meta and thus far I feel like we haven't really seen their strength come through
2:15:18
this season and this game was a great example of where they were able to play that way yeah I mean I'm not going to lie after the draft I thought it's going
2:15:25
to be two likeed yeah 2 for the T1 but I mean you could definitely see that from
2:15:32
the draft because there are so many M Champions and also like Zyra Khan is not really that good into Azel Leona as well
2:15:39
so I think the draft wise it was really rough to like pull it off from uh their
2:15:46
just team comp was just so hard to pull off but I think as you mentioned ji just for really well does just hard enough
2:15:53
combo I mean as you can see on the B dive it was really rough after this free
2:15:59
dive on the Zia rer died uh at level two and uh and I think after that it was
2:16:05
kind of Easy Snowball from t one that that was what I expected but what happens now is chovi trading on the mid
2:16:11
lane so the big thing here is that ruler was kind of taken out because it was Dove level one but then what happens
2:16:18
instead is Choi takes a great trade which allows to GR the setup meaning the swap that T1 did towards top side to try
2:16:24
and match those grubs doesn't actually come to fruition meanwhile ruler is in a 1 V one with Canan so he just gets to
2:16:30
farm up gets to negate the lead that T1 build early and then now you have a situation where Canan is super far
2:16:36
behind ruler is no longer behind and the grubs have started and a lot of that comes from the combination mid pryo Keen
2:16:42
playing really well and then T1 trying to match for an objective and being unable to do so yeah I could see the
2:16:48
reason why they SWA because of the Oly but I think they could just give up Alli three grops and just go for the oi Drake
2:16:55
rotation and also just you can swap later on for the later three grops but I
2:17:01
think T1 was kind of uh feel rushed on uh cion getting humbled on uh uh a on
2:17:08
Top Lane yeah again a a a great sign of a team not only just what's happening what are they doing to us it's what else
2:17:14
can we get around the map the Big punish there by geni keeps them in the game and turns it around which then led to this
2:17:19
big fight here at 29 minutes at the Drake where things broke open yeah after good rotation they got the full
2:17:25
objective controls and this is the moment that uh geni got the soul point I
2:17:30
mean they kind of forced they cannot do anything on that one because you have to fight for the soul but you don't have
2:17:37
enough power to fight back yeah you can really see that T1 was I think short of hitting some spikes this time smash was
2:17:43
nearly as accelerated this is also after ruler just uh trying to collapse onto an
2:17:48
Ezreal and just getting caught and ding which which made the game I think a lot closer feel a lot closer than it should
2:17:54
have been there were still a couple of good fights from T1 but the early game fundamentals that came from from J that
2:18:00
got them to free Drakes very early on meant that I think this game was always going to be an uphill battle two points here you wanted to see a difference
2:18:05
between chovi and game one into game two this one obviously having a much larger impact what do you think the big
2:18:11
difference was in this one crony so it was just the execution there's chovi has
2:18:16
uh I think been outspoken about off you're seeing Faker do the things that he did in in the World Finals and chovi
2:18:22
his continued shortcom internationally he's trying to swap up his play style right we haven't really seen him play
2:18:27
fully Lane focused and I think that the Yon game he was still trying to do a lot of stuff the execution just wasn't
2:18:33
really there cuz he's going for riskier angles in the silus game did the same thing but it does actually end up
2:18:38
working out I mean it was even harder you know you are playing against air yeah you were very pessimistic yeah I
2:18:43
mean Mee versus Range match up you always need the jungler and support around you but I think chobi did really
2:18:49
well on the trade like by him self he didn't even need a jungler like he just uh traded really well on him by himself
2:18:56
so I think all those kind of stuffs comes from just better skill shots
2:19:01
basically right it's simple but just don't miss just hit the goat you know last thing I'm going to
2:19:08
leave the casters here it's their T1 second loss with smash this is probably his first one where is a little bit more
2:19:14
muted a lot happening around with T1 let's see if they're going to be able to bounce back here to win the series or
2:19:20
will Jen close it on out hopefully brain surgery is now done for Atlas as he was trying to put his brain back together so
2:19:26
let's send it back on over the casters much thank you big time dig on
2:19:33
oh no it's going wrong take it ORS away we'll get you the help you need
2:19:41
friend no it was actually it was a a thriving success they unfortunately missed on the humor Center um so that's
2:19:49
why the jokes are still pretty terrible I was just really hoping yeah I was just hoping that they'd accidentally turn me
2:19:55
into a funny person but they didn't quite get there um let's dive into the draft here and see who's going to be able to come out on top in game number
2:20:01
three T1 back on the blue side a theoretical Advantage based on win rates here in the lck but other regions would
2:20:08
have different things to say about which side is more powerful and in a game three in a Fearless scenario things can
2:20:14
get wacky first band going to be a ity and this is why blue side I think is so much stronger because you still have to
2:20:21
ban the must ban Champions and so less flexibility every game so far the series
2:20:26
and most games so far in the LC ke cup have just been band sconner ban clister
2:20:32
or suffer yep um so they'll take those two out the way and then they have one ban freed up to
2:20:38
try and work with uh they did actually ban Aurora themselves in game one and
2:20:44
obviously very aware of the strength of the pck so could look you do that again well they can't because it's Fearless oh
2:20:50
sorry it's Fearless yeah yeah so thankfully they banned that one themselves so
2:20:55
strategic indeed um what is the highest priority Champion right now though that
2:21:00
is kind of the question I'm looking at it looking down the line and I'm thinking like even Lilia stock is like
2:21:06
kind of way up as Cory is going to be taken away and I guess like honestly kind of makes sense even though it's 2
2:21:12
and 13 those two wins have come in more recently and Rumble is certainly a big priority there as Gallo going to come
2:21:19
through as well so there quite a few Champions that are certainly are worthy of that high priority tag
2:21:26
interesting ban the Gallo given they Bandit on last game on blue side but also if you end up picking like the
2:21:31
rumble yourselves you know one of the first times we saw Gallo recently when he started showing up was play top into
2:21:38
Rumble um so they have that flexibility option if you go in that direction yourselves and the first pick Le in is
2:21:46
kind of out there but uh Canyon going to do it you can see he's like oh man I'm going to have to lock in I'm going to
2:21:52
have to make sure that these uh these hands are working to Perfection and last
2:21:57
time he played this Champion it was a master class it was gorgeous I mean it it kind of makes sense with the priority
2:22:02
on jungles like going down the list of the ones picked but it's it's interesting that Sani hasn't had a look
2:22:09
in at all this series all right qu is going to be locked in here uh theoretical somewhat
2:22:16
flex but probably not chovy has been very very good at this Champion doesn't really feel like a Gallo counter
2:22:21
necessarily but as far as what kind of compositions you build around Gallo they're kind of the ones that you want
2:22:27
to be playing way into yeah I think what's going to be really important for T1 is getting some dive that is not dive
2:22:34
um that is paper man yeah does have the re potential but I think it's going to be really important that when you're
2:22:39
playing something like way you want to get on top of him and especially when you have a gallo and a rumble these
2:22:45
Champions benefit so much from people being able to set them up if you had like a VI here fantastic but it's
2:22:51
Fearless so V is gone if you had maai fantastic Fearless maai is gone so they
2:22:56
need engage in the composition to set up these two picks and to get on top of that long range way uh so we'll see if
2:23:03
they able to pick some something up now that can sort of lead to that yeah this is kind of crazy because you can see
2:23:09
what T1 were doing picking the gallo and good I think Wukong works very well the Wukong fantastic the the V go honestly
2:23:16
terrible cuz that would be three Champions that need set up but the Wukong can do that work themselves the
2:23:21
sad thing is ran would be just unre unreal with his composition but it is
2:23:27
again not available because it was played last game by Duro so those other
2:23:32
options and J kind of committing to like long range backline carries so they basically need to make
2:23:39
sure owner gets nowhere near them um that is the aim of the game because unfortunately when uh when the monkey
2:23:46
gets there the gargoyle gets there as well so ruler and Troy going to be having a bad time feels like a lot of
2:23:53
finesse required here for the Gen composition thus far we'll see what they augment it with as far as support and Top Lane first though bans have to come
2:23:59
in ad carries I think going to be looked at here on the geneng side I feel like honestly supports if you ban away like
2:24:04
the engage supports you could get so much value here like even removing like pleni interestingly T1 doing that
2:24:11
himself I thought T1 maybe B away like the Lulu H I guess they're thinking you know geni want to play some engage
2:24:17
themselves and and Juro proficient but I really think one the more engage you get with this composition the easier the
2:24:22
game is going to be I think geni also don't care about engage at all yeah I I think you you could have just picked Lulu and you know we've seen geni play
2:24:29
the Jinx L before so I would definitely oh I was I was really expecting that
2:24:35
Caitlin would be pretty high priority when it comes to the band smash really good at the champion and does have a lot of range T1 it feels like the batting
2:24:43
the picks I would expect them to play so potentially looking to go a different direction um putting a lot of faith into
2:24:49
owner and and I guess Faker as well in the Gallo to be able to set things up the Lulu is really standing out like a
2:24:55
sore thumb udia makes me feel no no happiness at all guys this isn't what
2:25:02
this isn't why we wanted Fearless oh it was a mistake un do oh dear well Zer
2:25:08
going to be locked in Zer Lulu absolutely gorgeous that feels like they just like they just moved their Rook
2:25:15
into like the most unseen place and that's Checkmate um it wasn't actually
2:25:21
that unseen uh it was kind of walked into and why like why not just lock the
2:25:26
Lulu instead Milo a consideration here is Duro thinking about the thresh yeah I kind of hate
2:25:34
composition I liked it until these last two where it's like they moved to the
2:25:39
edge of the cliff and they were teetering and then they just said we're going to send it and launch themselves
2:25:44
off I will say if Ona falls behind this com from T1 might get a lot harder to play there's a lot of TOS you know with
2:25:51
the thresh and the and the lein that can disengage so I do feel like by not going to engage support they lack that to some
2:25:57
degree but they've the thing they've gained in return is a lot of scaling a lot of Team fight clean up with the zeri
2:26:03
Lulu H and ji have udia you know I I just think it's going
2:26:09
to be a struggle because when the fight start the team fight from T1 is just so much better and geni it's not like they
2:26:15
have a composition that like rolls early so I think they're weaker in team fights I think
2:26:20
they don't necessarily hardwin Lanes I think geni you know it's not that the draft isn't playable but I'm favoring T1
2:26:27
right now with what they have quite heavily yeah but it really comes down to I think owner and and fakeer the mid
2:26:32
jungle if things go wrong there and your front line isn't able to like charge forwards I think the game becomes
2:26:39
infinitely harder and we have to remember that this game is very important um for both of these teams but
2:26:44
for T1 especially they can be first place in their group with a victory um there were tiebreakers spoken
2:26:51
about before I had my brain repaired tiebreakers are actually impossible now it is either you're first or you're not
2:26:58
and so let's see whether geni can make this composition that we don't really enjoy that much work or whether it's
2:27:04
going to be T1 with this Gallo Rumble that works out for them time to jump out of the rift for game three
2:27:22
all right little bit of a shout out to the current team that he's playing on there with the Samsung Galaxy thresh as
2:27:29
well as a shout out to the man who's working for the enemy uh in MA who did
2:27:34
get that skin in 2014 very cool stuff there from Duro a lot of layers to the
2:27:39
shout out we'll see what geni strategy is level one pushing in pretty aggressively
2:27:45
for vision here you know udia can do fine in swaps and if they have some game
2:27:51
plan based around that maybe they can find a way to navigate this but it looks like it's just establishing vision for now yep and it looks like that swap is
2:27:59
going to come on through you can see carrier already moving towards the top side smash will be following after that recoil does come through and so a fair
2:28:07
bit of information but it looks like the uh Rumble will be spotted heading down towards that bottom side and right now
2:28:13
ruler and dur you can see they're hedging a little bit before they move most likely towards the top side but
2:28:18
right now they are moving bot Lane W is pinged but I don't know whe he was he actually out of vision I think he
2:28:24
might have been as Canyon moves on over here will be able to secure his popcorn chickens couple of them taken there from
2:28:30
Canyon as level two Canyon smited and owner got it that's so bad that's such a
2:28:37
bad start o i mean In fairness I feel like in this game you kind of have to go
2:28:44
for something a little bit zany based on my opinions on the draft Yeah but that couldn't have backfired more for Canyon
2:28:50
he will be behind on is going to get a bit of Advantage at the start it is Lane swop situation uh not very fun playing
2:28:58
uh udia into double range Champions but at least you know the dive isn't that strong from like a zeri Lulu even a
2:29:05
Wukong as well it's actually very low dive threat on Ania so I think Keen is kind of okay well Hook is going to
2:29:11
connect max range there and the playback gets a flash out from Doran those flame Trump is great position it's one of
2:29:16
those situations where you're trying to be in range with experience but if you're in range to be hooked you just too far up that really shouldn't be
2:29:21
happening from Doren um fortunately Canyon's on the top side and is behind a
2:29:27
bit fear man yeah that was pretty good exceptionally played as oh dear Canyon's
2:29:32
woes continue here as Tempest going to come out there not able to carrier as keen's going to move on over
2:29:38
to defend his Le in he's just going to die all right Smite comes down as carrier could be in trouble cany going
2:29:45
to have to flash away as carrier flashes to get the kill he should be going down
2:29:50
for it but Kean might be sacrificing his life ghost not enough and that's a kill to smash absolute disaster for genen G I
2:29:58
think T1 pretty okay with his situation you know Doren be his flash he's like oh no what if I get Dove don't worry krier
2:30:04
is solo killing the enemy jungler killing and ruler is going to be able to grab a kill himself Duro somehow
2:30:11
surviving the turret there very nicely done misses a cannon but I guess the minus ones feel a little bit more muted
2:30:17
yeah so just as everything is going right for T1 ji get an answer back Doren just there's no other way to spin
2:30:24
it you shouldn't be dying in this manner you you're just too far up when you're outside the tower car just finds Canyon
2:30:31
remember Canyon's behind because of that invade they're even on levels right like yeah there's no respect here at all and
2:30:37
can like I just need to finish the camp I just need to finish the camp I just need to finish I just need to finish the camp let me finish the and he's dead
2:30:43
yeah um great flash at the end there from car to finish off he does go down but then he feeds a kill to smash and
2:30:48
now they're looking for the dive this is four people this is is going to happen yeah Keen um not feeling super good as
2:30:53
the extend of beam comes on through takes a little while there as carrier tanks turret really nicely and T1 just
2:30:58
execute the UDA um guys Canyon is getting these Raptors okay he is this is his focus in
2:31:06
this game he's getting yeah um but a great roam from Faker there the power of the Gallo no surprise to see Faker
2:31:13
makeing good use of it be push wave in find an angle move there and what is typically a rough dive having like Lulu
2:31:19
as Zer Wukong becomes so easy with a Gallo let's have a look at it one more
2:31:25
time checking out this play from rer and duro I mean this is kind of twofold cuz on the one hand credit to Duro some
2:31:30
fantastic hooks but you just shouldn't even be in range if you're Daren like allowing this to happen and I I know why
2:31:38
he's like trying to get in the XP range but it it just backfires so massively and after the first time we lost his
2:31:43
flash you can't let it happen again yeah here just a full Channel torn carrier has aggro beautifully played with this
2:31:49
Shield as well can tank a few heads well now we've got Smash and
2:31:56
carrier down towards the bottom side Landing against dur and rer fair bit of movement speed uh between the two of
2:32:02
these with the uh Lulu available already on the Zer this is not ideal not idealy
2:32:09
cast minion it is uh I don't know whether wolf would have certified it just yet he is at home watching along
2:32:15
right now so he can probably let you know in the chat whether he has certified it that's still time that's still time yep we'll need the paperwork
2:32:21
in the male um if we are going to see as trovy does have the spiraling despair
2:32:27
now and I just want to see what happens here towards this bottom side it's not doomed just yet but it's looking real
2:32:33
close as now Troy does throw out that ultimate button Justice punch gets Faker out of there but he's going to have to go back home teleport still with half of
2:32:39
a cool down didn't even pop the taunt there uh for Faker which has that damage reduction I think it kind of shows that you you can definitely have pressure on
2:32:46
Gallo so hard to solo kill him so bulky um but does a good job of for out lane
2:32:52
bu some time and ultimately it's not so much about hey I have PR I can move it's
2:32:57
honestly more so about Gallo can't move and Canyon now looking does get a grub
2:33:03
yeah will force owner away a bit but fer coming back should be lsh on Mana I
2:33:08
don't think can really stick around here one grub going to take it and be happy yeah bit of a speed up there as well as
2:33:14
oh just gets in there once again owner is going to Smite it away that's with resonating strike as well now doran's
2:33:21
coming down and Canyon I don't know whether he's getting out of this one and by I don't know I mean he's definitely
2:33:26
not getting out of this one that is a kill going over to Faker with those Winds of War you know considering how clean the last Le in game was from
2:33:32
Canyon this one has been so rough loses he used to Smite there as well resonating strike still gets out smed by
2:33:38
Ona lost that camply now 02 and one and the only good news is the fact that they
2:33:43
at least get one of those grubs so at least the Feats aren't going to be there to worry about but already the amount of
2:33:50
kills that threshold is being crossed for T1 so one of those speeds of strength already there and you know I I
2:33:56
was concerned about if own falls behind when he's the one who needs to be leading the charge Wukong can feel very underwhelming he's having a great game
2:34:02
he's in a really good position and I feel like T1 they're looking fantastic
2:34:09
already in this game 4-2 in the kill score only about a 700 gold lead but this is the start you want absolutely
2:34:15
and I don't know I just don't know what gen's composition outside of like Jinx gets excited kills everyone like that is
2:34:22
obviously a thing that you can do is we're going to see this once again owner's smites have been ice
2:34:27
cold I honestly think just in general owner's form has been so fantastic and
2:34:33
LC cup clean with the smites as well which is funny especially considering oh see on a flank here yeah try does get a
2:34:40
bit of a fear but doesn't want to get taunted Canyon blocked there by the warrior trickster is Carrier getting
2:34:45
taken down low but smash throws down the ulti Duro in so much trouble and ruler throwing what autos he can dodging a lot
2:34:52
of these burst FES with the Flash Forward the barrier the hook goes wide and down goes the Jinx and there's no
2:34:58
chance that's the double and smash oh man if he wasn't certified before he is
2:35:04
now yeah I mean so strong now with those extra two kills 4 and0 zeri and Just gen
2:35:10
not respecting the level six from Zer we've had so much Zer Lulu oh yeah in
2:35:15
the lck and one of the big things that's always been true is the level six Allin spike is insane you can see Zer Lulu
2:35:22
sitting back not doing much being pressured you hit that level six and it's a game changer and Genies don't
2:35:28
respect it and especially considering you have a thres you can just farm at a distance and have the thres play Lantern
2:35:34
but overzealous overconfident and they pay for da yeah we're going to have a look at this one more time and look at
2:35:40
that Lantern placement as well I mean Duro hits hits the hook and they go in and then oh smash just in melee range
2:35:47
able to get so much value yeah the level up comes through uh great flashing there
2:35:52
from car gets extra damage good Dodge there from Smash dodg both those critical skill shots he was so low and
2:35:58
he was out of vision as well but they swept it at exactly the right time carer gives him just the
2:36:04
information and you know we came out of draft favoring one side we'll be honest you know it looked good 4 T1 but when
2:36:11
you got a for reri there's not a draft in the world that looks bad for the four very and it already looked good it
2:36:17
already looked good Smash in a fantastic position to carry this game now geni fishing for something here they do have
2:36:23
Canyon with kick available bear in mind no flashes for T1 and he is snuck into
2:36:28
this brush we'll see how sneaky he's been as owner is going to come on over it's likely a 3v3 I think you always
2:36:34
have to be very cautious into it there's kick there's the kick flash the Box goes down and smash once again with the ulti
2:36:40
see whether the Gatling gun's enough and it absolutely is shutdown goes to the Jinx and did carrier actually ult
2:36:47
himself because he wasn't quite in time or something like that did that just happen did I witness that I don't know
2:36:53
didn't quite see but 63 gold for ruler there which do pretty drastically Clos
2:36:58
the Gap those are the sort of plays you have to make uh Canyon finds an angle and the thing is you normally play pretty safe against a thresh in general
2:37:05
because he has the lantern for the extra like setup but owner was bot side and so I think T1 had this perceived view of
2:37:12
safety which I get your 40 you're playing Zer Lulu you have your Wukong nearby so it's just a fantastic angle
2:37:18
from ji just slip in and and kind of go with that overconfidence I feel like it's been back and forth a little bit of
2:37:24
overconfidence in these bot Lanes have been and car had to ult himself because he was trying to stop uh Canyon from
2:37:29
being able to get the combo just didn't stop the kick yeah yeah that was why he did it that's what memory is telling me
2:37:36
anyway Canyon still clean with the kicks smites haven't been on point but the kicks still are y see whether he can
2:37:42
continue to redeem himself because I think he's going to need a little bit more work done after what had happened in the other game uh some plates being
2:37:49
stolen way here by Smash and carrier yeah they can't really damage Keen but I mean at least Keen can stand in front of
2:37:55
the tower when smash cues for him to hear him but yeah not really making much Headway onto him specifically we got the
2:38:02
yal uh from rer which has been buffed on this patch so a lot of attack speed a lot of uh ad lot of crit an item that
2:38:09
has all three which is not really a thing anymore since they changed them y actually coming towards the top side
2:38:15
just to make sure that they defend yeah and ji getting some plates here so bringing it back a little bit we'll see
2:38:21
the kick coming out here I'm a kick and yeah beautiful kick I think he just Ed
2:38:27
so close to the interruption actually I think yeah but of course flash makes it so hard yeah it's it's difficult the
2:38:34
thing is the extra health for smash probably wouldn't have made much of a difference although obviously ideally smash no it's the right call for Carrier
2:38:40
he just almost stops smash from being kicked out yeah so fortunate do see a
2:38:46
lot of trading of plates here uh Doran does have a he doesn't have equalizer used it just before so this next wave is
2:38:54
potentially going to set up a kill actually then they can go for Di if Thor sticks around well Canyon going to move
2:39:01
on down here does have that kick back up that gets the mini stun that is going to be flame Chompers and my goodness that
2:39:06
is a very dead Rumble Canyon almost dies but doesn't quite and so more plates and actually second turret going to be going
2:39:13
on over here as T1 they do manage to get the Feats of Strength this game they're not that far ahead in the ji kind of
2:39:20
holding on to it oh God okay can if he's playing that I will say chobby had a lot
2:39:25
of pressure there on Faker you can see Faker try to move down got hit by the ult from chovi if Gallia was able to get
2:39:31
in range and ult Game Changer yeah so good moves from chy that to prevent that
2:39:36
from happening uh and also having the way PR in the first place you can see fakeer like just runs down immediately
2:39:43
on the mini map and gets stopped the execution there from geni pretty Flawless not much Doran can do but the backup didn't come in
2:39:49
uh and the dive ends up being successful well the thing that is making me pretty excited about the game state
2:39:56
right now is that it just really feels like smash versus ruler it's like the old Guard versus the new can ruler do
2:40:03
what he's done many years uh in a row prior to this which is just hard carry
2:40:09
um his Jinx certainly something that he's been able to do on in the past but smash has got Zer like as far as main
2:40:15
characters are concerned she is the champion as heal actually going to come out from car in sponse to the hook good one there from Duro I think my big
2:40:21
concern for Gen cuz you know ped jins can do great things and the gold is pretty even between these ad carries the
2:40:28
problem is you know Jinx gets so much benefit from that first initial kill yeah and yes you can have canion kick
2:40:35
someone in but it's tricky to lead a fight with that because there so much to interrupt you like you're playing into
2:40:41
Wukong Gallo Lulu we've seen Canyon get great kicks you know we saw that one
2:40:46
that was in the Mad movie but that was ultimately him getting a kick later in the fight getting that initial kill and setting up
2:40:51
rer going to be a tough task I feel taking damage once again uh owner
2:40:58
is just better at smiing as the playback is really good flash out just to make sure that smash doesn't get the value
2:41:03
immediate cleanse and heroic entrance was immediately also interrupted as Keen
2:41:09
is able to press e and Boop and that does it so all of the Altis now on cool down geni with a slight Advantage super
2:41:15
mega Death rocket is going to be there but I will say two flashes B from T1 more than happy about that yeah I think
2:41:23
also great flashes to have ideally You' get R flash don't get me wrong he is playing very aggressive there punishing
2:41:29
smash ideally getting ruler flash is the best thing but the easiest Target to pick is thresh being that he's so IM
2:41:35
mobile and can you not having H flash means he's going to have such a hard time finding these kicks so in terms of
2:41:42
value T1 definitely getting a lot out of that play but still having to respect ruler on this Jinx especially the range
2:41:47
Advantage this is the thing is once T1 Clos a distance that range Advantage is for nothing that's why having the engage
2:41:54
I felt was really important but if you don't have those tools you know if owner's not in a position to get on top
2:42:00
of ruler he can't just sit back and free fire and so K chovy yeah it's really interesting actually I I really like
2:42:06
this sort of dichotomy that we're seeing with the new look T1 with now smash on the roster because normally T1 would be
2:42:12
the team playing Jinx they were trying to do this in the the Zer meta that we were stuck in for so long right it was
2:42:18
the Jinx into the Zer outrange her and be that hyper carry withi on the lineup
2:42:24
and now smash little bit better at the uh the Zer side of things and ruler is the guy that wants to be playing the
2:42:30
Jinx in this matchup it's kind of interesting how the shoe is on the other foot does remind me a lot of his jdg
2:42:36
times that MSI when he was on taking over we know he can do it it's just can
2:42:42
he do it against this uh gold lead is still it's it's small it's definitely within range uh feets aren't going to
2:42:47
make that much of a difference uh Canyon going in on owner they do manage to get the cyclers oh carrier
2:42:54
could be in trouble King comes over yeah he's just dead no wild growth is going to help him there and it's actually chy that gets the kill rer getting excited
2:43:01
zap going wide and Jenji with control of the fight for now oh another hook connecting Duro main character in this
2:43:09
one and there's the spiraling to spare it's another kill for smash as the udia goes down and Canyon I think he'll win
2:43:16
the Smite fight on this one as he's the only one there I feel like we've had so long of thresh just kind of being that
2:43:21
Lantern bot we had the W Max thresh which was a big thing for a while last time we really saw him in the meta Duro
2:43:27
is making the claim for the qax value getting up consistently is what you love
2:43:33
to see but I feel like it just hasn't been a thing for such a long time it's so difficult to find picks on the back of thresh because you know his his Q is
2:43:40
such a long wind up it's quite Telegraph he's making it work he really is this is a gorgeous play I think the last time we
2:43:47
saw Thresh be like so incred incredibly pivotal was carrier after that Q buff
2:43:52
came in and thresh for like a patch or two was just broken um carrier really showed us that um so we're going to go
2:43:59
back into live here as another Hook is going to connect that's another kill for
2:44:04
ruler and oh man Duro I think he's feeling better he's feeling better he's redeeming himself for that elas game
2:44:10
which a little bit rough game one but he is just carrying right now getting so much
2:44:16
value that's clean all right they're going to now try and take down this out of turret in the mid lane and I don't think anyone's going to be able to stop
2:44:22
them let's have a look at this replay once again keep your eyes on Duro I mean it's just phenomenal uh does end up
2:44:28
messing up the play a little the end but still finds the kill gets the flash from carrier and it's this next one that you
2:44:34
got to look out for dor has just been a hook magnet this game and I mean they were honestly it was like fish in a
2:44:40
barrel but still really nicely played and who really he also had a lantern
2:44:45
there for Kean I want everyone to know the Keane was a bit dead oh the
2:44:50
flame yeah and so we gave Duro a bit of credit as we came out of the replay but great setup there from uh from R up and
2:44:58
playing Gallo into Jinx is a bit frustrating given the arm time and the fact that Justice punch does require you to go backwards for a bit considering
2:45:04
how Doom this game was looking in the draft in the draft in the first 10
2:45:10
minutes geni are really bouncing back making this competitive yeah and it's so
2:45:15
interesting right because the same reasons that we're saying that P1 were in such a phenomenal position it's those
2:45:21
five kills that are on the Zer that exact same point is now mired on the other side because rer he carries these
2:45:29
y uh chovi also over th000 gold up over Faker on this way they can keep those
2:45:34
carries safe it is a very winnable game for Gen G iie picked up already for rer
2:45:42
oh fer could be in a little bit of trouble here as he is SN momentarily but not gone not the easiest pick Target
2:45:47
yeah there some durability but you can see the pressure that geni has over the map you can see them really setting up
2:45:53
the vision around where adakan is going to spawn in the top side which is uh oh it's vicious yeah oh really yeah wow
2:46:00
that's um surprising I was uh I was expecting ruus not to be uh the case this time as rer going to be able to
2:46:08
grab that red buff gives the other half of it over to Canyon and so close to it being uh going over to everyone but not
2:46:15
quite I think the thing is we look at going on this Wukong we're
2:46:20
looking at like angles he can get into approach and I think having vision is going to be really important if you're just running into areas where geni has
2:46:27
all the vision they see you coming thr can do such a good job of disengaging the Wukong yeah I mean play is probably
2:46:34
the thing we're looking out for but even the Box will make Z's life difficult as you're just trying to run a mck in in a
2:46:40
team fight we don't really talk about the Box being valuable but actually think in that instance it does work you ideally want to be a flank because you
2:46:46
don't want thresh toble to just Lan on them backwards if chobi clicks all his buttons and he has a lot of buttons on
2:46:52
this champion in One Direction you're just not going to be able to make your way in so as T1 have started to fall a
2:46:58
bit behind they need to get a bit creative with how they're approaching fights um to favor them it's a mountain
2:47:03
Soul um that added durability definitely a lot of value for these hyper carries if they can get it and uh ruler has kind
2:47:11
of Hit the point where he's just really happy right he's got the I and the unes completed for and it's likely to be a
2:47:18
rapid fire Cannon coming in next probably wants to get some armor penetration at some point but maybe not
2:47:23
given the enemy composition that he's up against no real true tank to worry about yeah you definitely want it eventually
2:47:29
but you're not nearly as much of a rush as were uh in the last game although and in the last game he built three items
2:47:34
that weren't those anyway yeah he took his time oh ruler goes for a control Ward but Chomp is first and doesn't die
2:47:41
beautiful you love to see it ooh Duro information over to owner there as he sweeps him out but the Flaming monkey
2:47:49
not going to be doing anything just yet chovy doing what he likes the most which is clearing up minions successfully
2:47:54
taking cannons rer does the same thing Jonah strong and everyone watching from home very happy with the satisfaction
2:48:01
level of cannons being taken in the last few seconds Genji just being very rigorous
2:48:08
with this Vision clearing out using the Chompers defensively having the thresh St as well makes it so hard especially
2:48:13
since that you know game one they had the vi right at T1 you have so much CC you can lay you have the poppy as well
2:48:21
there's not actually that much to hold people on geni in place um that they
2:48:26
can't like grab a lantern in between yeah like if owner Al you need someone immediately there to CC them after no
2:48:33
you need someone immediately there to pile control Wards on it that also works but like you know Gallo also knew he's
2:48:39
not going to come down for a while oh owner in trouble oh that Warrior trickster just paid for itself in gold
2:48:44
as Ral goes down there's the flash hook not going to connect pan had the Flash get out of the way of it spiraling
2:48:50
despair now on cool down not doing a massive amount of damage as shell I don't think she's going to survive for the Char never mind going to
2:48:56
successfully managed to get a bunch of damage onto that inner turret is now Mountain Soul we haven't even spoken
2:49:01
about this but I feel like Mountain soul is absurd for both of these teams yeah really is a lot of Tanks get well tanks
2:49:08
on the side of jji get a lot of value with the extra durability if ji get it and Chi and ruler just that much harder
2:49:13
to kill it's going to be painful not to mention if Faker gets it and then he has that extra shield and he's that big
2:49:18
front line that they need as Kean just going to walk in here he can do that he is a Udo uh see how he's going to go as
2:49:26
Warrior trickster does mean that it's just the Clone as oh every Hook is scary Mur hasn't been land in very many of
2:49:33
them recently Just Fishing you know see where he can find noncommittal cc is the aim of the game I also think ruler able
2:49:39
to position so aggressively up in the lane knowing you have the thresh to back you up real game changer here and also
2:49:45
like rer was at his Peak when he was playing in Tom thresh metas right and so
2:49:50
I feel like he's going back to the old times where he was the true main character and that is uh certainly a
2:49:56
good sign for G fans the other side T1 keeping it so incredibly close like this is anyone's
2:50:02
game right now Aon has being up and available for a very long time and we're going to have him and Baron on the map
2:50:10
together it's going to make things pretty spicy towards that top side as we can see Vision always being traded
2:50:16
between the two of them just been throwing so many of that uh
2:50:21
long range projectile into these brushes and just kind of don't do a canyon oh he gets the Smite Redemption all right post
2:50:28
20 minutes that's when the smites are going to start Landing that's when they matter anyway honestly it is early game smites who cares you know oh you got my
2:50:36
Raptors I'm taking your Baron uh-huh well trovy also able to collect that blue buff as well that feels pretty
2:50:44
nice and roll up now with it was actually renan hurricane the picked up as well so going to be doing a whole
2:50:50
bunch more AOE thought it might be going uh towards the rapid fire just for a little bit more safe poke damage I think
2:50:55
the thing with the rapid fire is you already have so much range the T1 composition and if you think of how T1
2:51:01
are going to be approaching everyone is kind of short ranged and kind of going to be running at you so you'll probably get a bit of value good amount of value
2:51:07
there yeah uh same items cost both 80 carries you know smash is a tiny tiny
2:51:13
Advantage from the uh feature strength boots yep and that's already looking at
2:51:18
uh damage GLW for both of these and especially when you compare like you know fake is just recalling only got his
2:51:23
second item owner work on his second item like these ad carries are all monster p and you know we normally see
2:51:30
that in Pro play where you thrun on resources to them but even with that in context like ruler has 40 more CS than
2:51:37
chovi than chovi by the way chovi ch's on 10 CS per minute chovi is Ching ruler
2:51:43
is just rer is rering he is rering uh that's top of the kills he has as well
2:51:49
there are a lot of objectives here in this top side of the map I feel like this is where the game is going to be
2:51:54
changed as Canyon dancing around the river and ke going to get melted here
2:52:00
momentarily as geni have started this one up oh I'm nervous I'm anxious let's see what T's going to be able to do
2:52:06
about it Faker heroic entrance up and available as they back away from Theon and just look to lock this one down
2:52:12
Cyclone not getting the most value ever as they dive on top of roller Smash in that back line ruler survives for a WI
2:52:18
smash as well is just diving on top of chy takes down both of the carries and
2:52:24
Keen gets one but it is all over for this fight T1 matters into their own
2:52:30
hands and smash comes in clutch order does his job perfectly we need to engage
2:52:35
we need to get on the back line he finds an angle and smashes there for the followup using Zer perfectly both
2:52:42
carries go down team fights over and in a blink of an eye gen G crumble on just
2:52:48
it's a good Flash from ruler he avoids initial CC but juro's on top of him the lantern is little value and smash is
2:52:54
there to follow up carrier sends him with the wild gr says go with my blessings oh yeah and he
2:53:00
does oh man T1 finding exactly the window they looking for and I actually didn't think that the Cyclone was going
2:53:07
to be what they required right you saw that Flash come out as rer avoids a lot of the CC smash knew exactly who he
2:53:14
needed to kill and he's like this is good this is good keep going takes down both of the D and then the fight is just
2:53:20
over interestingly enough even
2:53:26
though you can see the stress relief there for even though the initial knockup didn't hit ruler owner's initial
2:53:33
old CC Duro Canyon and those are the ones there to disengage him and it meant he got that followup but I just love the
2:53:40
confidence you know I said my concern for T1 was you know did you are you going to regret not having engaged
2:53:45
support is owner going to be enough the answer is yes he absolutely is and you Pudo do have an Engaged support I guess
2:53:52
as Canyon was fishing for an opportunity there as another Cyclone comes down remember Aon buff means that they're
2:53:57
just going to be sent home not too much more to worry about oh my goodness they're kind of in the blender though as one of them does go home I'm pretty sure
2:54:04
no never mind no aom Buffs actually going off and that is just a kill on Kee the Redemption value Mass oh he's
2:54:09
looking yeah Baker manages to get the Justice punch on to chovy who takes the lantern to get himself to relative
2:54:14
safety zap connects on to smash as Canon has to to get out of this equalizer that is shredding them Doran just wanting to
2:54:21
put them in the barbecue and they're diving underneath the inner they're all going to be taking a swift trip home but
2:54:28
it's a double for the Zer and so it's already kind of doomed they managed to get ruler as well that is precisely what
2:54:34
they were looking for yeah now got now they got time on the map long spawn timers for Canyon and ruler they got the
2:54:39
mountain dragon to pick up they have options all right fer just I think
2:54:44
wanted to get a bit of value here but let's have a look at this replay one more time yeah so Canyon goes in doesn't immediately get out again it's some good
2:54:51
CC in return and chy does so much damage but the Redemption value here actually massive for T1 they would have lost
2:54:57
owner and carry I think if come through maybe even smash as well but here this was so close to be even worse uh because
2:55:04
we get this initial play coming in but look at Doren so Doren ends up Ting and look he's about to flash he's about to
2:55:10
flash Fe so tragic he was going to melt both chovi and Canyon there and it still
2:55:15
goes well but that fear from chovi I think could have been game over if that fear had not come through I feel like
2:55:22
that yeah that managed to get like a couple of uh you know 200 gold uh pickups as they do send a few of the T1
2:55:29
members home still not great news but it's a bit there WR the game is not in a great spot for Gen but I I think they
2:55:35
actually would have ended if that faar had not stopped darn from just toasting them all and D hasn't had the best game it's been a bit rough got put behind but
2:55:41
it's equalized in the last uh the fight we just saw and the fight around adakan had a lot of value uh so really coming
2:55:48
back strong and now we saw these 80 carries at it par for such a long time there's now a 3,000 gold lead for smash
2:55:55
he's got a blood thst to completed where ruler only has components and he has a qss on top of that that's pretty
2:56:02
ridiculous um rer now wanting to complete said blood thirst but he's still a ways away from that one it's
2:56:07
just it's absurd when you look at everyone else and like people have like three items at best everyone else and
2:56:13
he's he's on four pushing five and he's got all of the money on the rift as we can see here 5,000 ahead of the nearest
2:56:21
on his team and that's exactly where you want that money to be if you are a T1
2:56:26
fan gen still trying to hold on as best they can but I just feel like the ud's kind of past is used by date as far as
2:56:33
being that front line he kind of melts if smash even pays any attention to it and there's The Equalizer just to bully
2:56:38
them away from this inner turret hook connects onto Faker but Faker able to tank for quite some time with that
2:56:44
movement speed as well the fear even gets him out of Dodge oh dear still Genji hold on to their inner
2:56:50
turret for the moment as this Warrior trickster not going to be anything they're going to be too worried
2:56:56
about and next thing to be up and available is looking like the baron in 2 minutes
2:57:03
time and so can ji get their ducks in a row that's the question Ona goes in Ona goes out and they're able to just have a
2:57:11
look as another hook going to connect that is one of the longest I've seen in quite some time dur not opting to go in Canyon was thinking about kicking back
2:57:18
Faker into the team but we know that he is relatively tanky here as smash like we were talking about if he does get
2:57:24
some free time with Kean we do some pretty legitimate damage to him it's crazy just the ABS and flows we've seen
2:57:30
in this game we had so long where jji just had complete pressure T1 were always hant to approach one big fight
2:57:35
and now it's just complete Reserve reverse where gen just kind of fishing for options I will say at least T1 is
2:57:42
still W away from the soul so that's not a concern right now but the problem I have with Genji's composition is want T1
2:57:49
to come into them and then play defensively peel back ruler gets space ruler does damage gets the resets but
2:57:55
when T1 of the ones you control the space gen G have to push forwards and enter when this Baron starts gen G have
2:58:01
to approach and it can make it really dangerous if T1 have Vision cuz you scared of Wukong flanks she's scared of Gallo flanks Rumble Zer flanks you know
2:58:08
so um it makes it very difficult so I think T1 no time pressure on them they just need to establish Vision around the
2:58:15
baron and force geni to come into them but they're going for for a cheeky play here ji won expect them to be on this
2:58:21
side of the map they don't find Keen though uh and In fairness you know they were looking for a cheeky pick but this
2:58:27
now means ji's actually done a good job of of pushing the vision back a little bit H you can see this line they're kind
2:58:32
of forming around their red buff they're still hesitant about pushing deeper but T1 basically just don't have Vision on
2:58:39
that side of the map and uh troby is three items in but you can see on this
2:58:44
way just trying to clear out waves uh around this map and it is feeling like things are kind of evening out but I'm
2:58:52
just so worried right I feel like the team fight that T1 managed to find around that arakan that was so
2:58:57
incredibly game defining it feels like there's not enough tools for Gen to stop
2:59:03
that from happening again unless Duro finds an ex exceptional uh play out of
2:59:10
like some dance through a wall that uh smash is able to accomplish that is so
2:59:15
difficult to replicate it's like you're you're hoping for like a miracle kick from Canyon but land the sonic wave and
2:59:21
Faker just stands on top of carrier and there's just nothing you can do uh they find a hook on oner on can disengage
2:59:28
just lose some health but he's a jungle he just sustain it back up it feels very hard to find the angle yeah it feels
2:59:34
like ji needs to start the fight with an advantage they need to use their range advantage to poke down T1 a little bit
2:59:41
it's kind of like they want to walk up oh I knew he was coming as Ona gets in there with the Cyclone right on top of chob as he takes the lantern out Keen
2:59:48
tanking exactly like he wants to as he dives into the backline smashed trying to replicate the play once again and
2:59:53
chovi is so close to dead rer is surviving this time but smash is getting underneath the enemy turret they've used
3:00:00
a bunch of cool downs and somehow Keen is still alive as he's running really quickly around this one but it looks
3:00:05
like T1 should be able to get back towards this dragon as it is spawning to try and lock that one down denji pretty
3:00:12
happy with that though a lot of tools from T1 all Summoners from T's bot Lane they survive this is kind of what they
3:00:18
wanted they push up T1 try and engage they managed to mitigate it and now you're lacking those engage tools that
3:00:24
you need so ji finally back a little bit in the driver's seat they're going to start at the baron they want to make something happen well they do have some
3:00:32
tool smash without the ultimate for now as troby does have that health bar back but taking damage from Baron can be
3:00:37
dangerous here as Canyon as well struggling to tank it effectively D finds his way back in speaking of in
3:00:43
owner gets on forward Lantern ride going to be taken out there from Canyon who is now looking a bit worse for there the
3:00:48
baron loses interest in the fight this is fine for T1 just buy time wait for those tools to be available again cyclon
3:00:54
coming up soon the zal's coming up soon you're not forced to fight then and owner did a great job of just forcing
3:01:00
them away not committing too much it's an excellent decision and now smash can just go solo this mountain dragon looked
3:01:07
a little bit shaky for a second but they regain form pretty quickly yep R going to be picking up the wave in mid and
3:01:13
then moving back towards The Fray as yeah smash securing soulle point here for T1 really starts putting
3:01:20
pressure on J as well but I don't know I feel like the game deciding fight will happen before the next 5 minutes it
3:01:26
feels like it's Jew you know and you're the man who knows about things being Jew
3:01:31
um as uh the um hmer life Esports win in the LK summer finals last year would
3:01:37
dictate to us so do you feel like it's du like when's the when's the game sarting fight in your opinion like
3:01:42
when's it going to be prediction I feel like it's coming soon if it's not around this Baron soon it's going to be when
3:01:48
that Dragon spawns cuz geni are not going to let them get soul and they'll have to commit heavily enough that it's going to be a big fight
3:01:54
so I think at the latest is in 4 minutes oh man so many people looking at this
3:02:01
young player smash so many eyes glued to him also a lot looking at ruler as well
3:02:07
as owner he's the one you really should be looking at cuz he'll be starting any fight the t's going to win Trum is going
3:02:13
down like yeah and everything everything is used like they're Focus so on this Wukong to make that he doesn't ruin
3:02:20
their day yeah so cautious about it I mean that's one thing is they know he is going to be the one diving in so they can kind of just respect him and that
3:02:26
fine but he is just playing with Reckless abandon it's working yeah although I thought it was smash who did
3:02:32
The Reckless abandonment yeah he did but uh it was his choice he wanted to go back to Europe okay ah yeah sir all
3:02:39
right oh they're closing in Doran o potentially out of position oh chy he's
3:02:44
got a flash yeah owner is going to get on top of him the lantern not even necessary though as the flame Chompers were enough well the fear value is so
3:02:51
big ch's been so cred with those every I I mean I'm struggling to breathe enough
3:02:57
in these moments Baron still there still going to be this key objective and even
3:03:03
though it's 5,000 gold it just feels like it's dead even yeah and remember T1 fighting for first in their group if
3:03:09
they can win this final game that's what they need yeah Stakes here but also just
3:03:17
T1 taking down geni always always something looking to do well only going
3:03:22
to go in once again but out not going to overly commit remember does have the ga as well a lot of lives
3:03:30
it's getting that point of the game where the carries are like full build look at R's opinion as well in
3:03:35
comparison to smashes smash is like I just need to be alive and do damage builds a ga and R's like I need more I'm
3:03:42
killing all of them and we're doing it quickly I think it's the thing where like when everyone else I mean you d d
3:03:48
has two items and some bonus stuff and are we waiting for Lord Doms is it coming should be coming soon but like if
3:03:54
you get caught and hit like by a couple of Autos by either these 8 carries oh there it is it is brutal and now with
3:04:01
this ldr owner you know he needs the disruption to get value he's not going to be that tanky against the damage from
3:04:06
this Jinx thinks like the Gallo are going to feel squishy oh double uh Z is actually
3:04:13
just picked up for T1 so they have the stasis on those font lers they have the G on you know both the Wukong and the ad
3:04:21
carry I'm so worried for jingi I just feel like ruler is way too squishy and there are so many resets and extra lives
3:04:29
for T1 there are too many threats to look out for the rabadon's not quite finished for chovy and the fact we have
3:04:34
it's like if you look at the Gold difference it's not that big but it's about like the difference between having
3:04:40
those extra zos those G all these extra things like the G in particular on own is the advantage they have over Canyon
3:04:46
yeah and it just makes it so much harder you can see T1 playing aggressive knowing this dragons in a minute 30 yeah as Kane doing the walk relatively
3:04:53
quickly maneuver it's a good strategy and now T want to just complete
3:04:58
control they just keep running around and chasing down members of geni who dare to step too far forwards and there's no more Vision left yeah
3:05:05
especially here on this bottom side which is the problem right like in a minute's time T1 can get a permanent
3:05:11
buff and geni I don't think they can afford to give that one up because already I feel like T1 are stacking the
3:05:16
deck in their favor with the utility items that they've been able to purchase okay still not over till it's
3:05:23
over and Canyon hitting level 16 now we've almost got a death cap done for troby he'll be doing some big old damage
3:05:30
it's so rough because you you do not want to give over soul but you also don't want to fight when tro is so close
3:05:36
to rabadons you would love to be able to just buy a bit of time an ideal world there's some
3:05:42
scenario where Canyon gets a Smite steel and gets a lantern out that's like perfect ji but it's wishful thinking T1
3:05:50
are not going to let them get away with that they're going to force a fight around this objective and ji trying to find a way in right now owner is just
3:05:58
trading Warrior trickster for lots of buts over and over again this Wukong is so dangerous as chovi off to the side
3:06:06
here he's going to miss the fear onto Smash and now Canyon has to kick him back and there's The Equalizer rer now
3:06:12
has to flash away as well as owner is Dashing forward the extendo beam so much damage under ruler and he is out of the
3:06:19
fight the Redemption helping the front line of gen here but 48 seconds until
3:06:25
Troy's back I feel like smash is just ruthless if he senses even a slight
3:06:31
misposition he is the player who will hunt for it commit his flash to make it happen he's bringing that challenges
3:06:36
aggression to the lck and he even catches choby off guard now D looking yeah Canyon he's going to have to flash
3:06:42
away from that one the flash taunt from Faker as ruler is dead once again
3:06:48
and T1 they weren't going to wait for it Kean is now a beautiful little snowman
3:06:53
but he's also heading to the death chamber more kills piled onto smash as
3:06:58
T1 will March up the mid lane and the game ladies and gentlemen is done it's
3:07:05
been a close Series so hard for but T1 as a unit you know we questioned how
3:07:10
will they look with Doren we saw smash come in who's looked fantastic but as a team as a unit equiz again is doing beautiful
3:07:19
things here as the spiraling despair is more what trovy is feeling and not what
3:07:24
T want to feeling as they take down the Nexus and they secure first place in the group and this game against J that's
3:07:32
going to feel fantastic another win as well for Smash and this time it was so
3:07:38
much about him that sir play absolutely beautiful just feels like you know at
3:07:43
times we maybe seen them before against gen where things start to go wrong they start to crumble it feels like that
3:07:49
clutch factor is there and you know T1 no strange is a clutch Factor we've seen it many times before but it's not every game and sometimes you know you're
3:07:55
waiting for these big matches at Worlds which obviously one them titles like that's when you want the clutch Factor but in the early stag in the group stage
3:08:02
of the ltk cup and we're seeing it we're seeing their ability to reexamine to bounce back to find these great angles
3:08:08
and it feels like as much as smash has been such a highlight since he's came in everyone in this roster has really
3:08:14
looked uh like such a solid performer in
3:08:25
equal the end killing chovi flashing in to find those kills well I want great I feel like pom
3:08:32
that's Up For Debate but as far as like f T1 especially like IND maybe even for the whole thing but for player of the
3:08:38
lck cup I feel like owner is just been he's been so good man oh for I mean
3:08:45
I I can 100% say that the owner has look like I'd say okay maybe Lucid is a
3:08:51
strong argument but I think probably owner or Lucid best jungler far in the lck cup and I think I'm leaning owner to
3:08:56
be honest he's just been so on form just so consistent every single game it feels like if he finds the window they're
3:09:03
going to win my concerns with the draft this game was okay you're relying on owner completely if he falls behind if
3:09:09
he can't find the engage if the enemy team is peeling well your comp might really struggle and he just made it
3:09:15
happen even when they fell behind even when they started out in the game he finds the angle and I think he's he's
3:09:20
you know we've seen that before in his VI but VI a lot easier to pil it in that manner but he just seems to be slam
3:09:25
dunking on these picks on these ad80 bruises where he can find an angle into fights it's very impressive this not so
3:09:32
impressive from the geni as far as the start was concerned Canyon a bit of a whoopsy here The Flash from carrier very
3:09:38
very sexy and even though he does eventually go down two for one trade and the Lulu manages to execute the enemy
3:09:44
jungler that's crazy and this is where it all started to go wrong as the hook missing because of an incredible uh
3:09:52
sweeper there from carrier gives the information to smash who's then able to avoid it playing Duro tried to get it back and
3:09:58
this game was so incredibly close yeah some great death sentences from Duro uh
3:10:04
especially since he wasn't feeling too well today I I think he had a really good performance game uh really did a
3:10:09
lot of work uh so fortunately not not enough and this I think was the play of
3:10:15
not just the game but even the series owner find this beautiful angle smash sliding in the confidence the trust in
3:10:21
your jungle to make it happen and then just sliding in like yeah I can do it I can clean up making it happen I mean I
3:10:27
want to go back as well like this Lulu was so valuable for T1 that could have
3:10:33
been the R4 Choice here for J and that was many though where you know he Dodges
3:10:40
the fear from chy chovy been so so many fights saw land and uh able to dip away
3:10:47
from you see here T1 yeah you can see the concentration here from T1 as well contemplating
3:10:53
whether it's a dragon angle right now as they're confirming no vision here
3:10:59
for G and then Doran finds the
3:11:05
angle follow up I'm going in with my flash says Faker and it is so
3:11:11
clean as Faker on a utility champion and I just think that it's so incredibly
3:11:18
good for T1 as soon as Faker can make a decision and make things happen yeah he does 11k damage who cares he started so
3:11:24
many of the game-winning fights here for T1 and even the one that like smash like
3:11:30
absolutely exploded in right like the engage froma was fantastic I mean figer didn't do a whole lot in that one but
3:11:36
when he is able to to make an impact it's beautiful and H I just never want
3:11:42
to see uder again I'm sorry as player of the match obviously going to be smash here dying
3:11:48
twice in the entire series 1304 on that Kaiser it feels like such a long time
3:11:54
ago uh that that game happened but he was uh yeah pretty impressive in that one too it really does and it feels like
3:11:59
he's thriving on these picks it kind of feels akin to the way kind of aiming played last year where you know he's
3:12:05
he's playing these things like the kais like the zeri you start a fight and he is there he's diving in he's cleaning up
3:12:11
and he's just so reliable it feels like there's a lot of trust clear given to him but he's just making it work yeah
3:12:17
and we get another conversation with him as well which is fantastic so let's throw it over to smash waiting
3:12:25
alongside thank you very much guys this is De for the lck cup P interview translation joined by Smash on the side
3:12:32
of T1 so you're with your victory in the
3:12:38
last group battle match you have secured the first place spot of group Baron how do you
3:12:45
feel no rather than the rankings our opponent was jeni so I just really
3:12:51
thought to myself I really want to win that was my
3:12:56
priority it's such an honor and it makes me so happy that we're also able to secure first place and you played
3:13:03
against the super senior veteran ruler so how did you feel going into this
3:13:09
match you know normally I actually grew up uh learning a lot from
3:13:14
ruler and I've always thought to myself you know I really want to try playing against him one day and I knew uh I was told that one
3:13:24
day I will have my dream come true and it's such a cool experience I'm
3:13:30
just so grateful for this
3:13:36
experience three against the enemy Jinx and thr you played s and Lulu and from
3:13:42
the start zeri took so many kills and ultimately carried the game so did you expect this to happen
3:13:49
no it wasn't really about expecting this to happen I think my teammates my my
3:13:54
Bros actually fed me so well and eventually the game Flow in a way flowed in a way where oh wow I started
3:14:03
believing that this game is definitely
3:14:08
winable and so it's like your entire team does have your back as you scale does this kind of support ever overwhelm
3:14:15
you yeah they let me get all the kills and they actually support me really well
3:14:20
I don't think it's much of a overwhelming experience I think I do get really excited the moment when I'm
3:14:27
playing the game and I just feel like I can carry the game any message to your supportive
3:14:36
teammates then you guys all always help me out so
3:14:43
that I can have a good time and I can play comfortably so I'm just thankful thank
3:14:50
you as we waited for the interview you told me that your hands are shaky but
3:14:56
you seem so confident and you seem great and now that you have locked in
3:15:02
the first seat of plans you'll have to prepare for a best of fives so what will you focus
3:15:09
on or best of fives I know that it's going to be Fearless draft until the very last game I think we'll just have
3:15:17
to be prepared and we'll have to think about all the different comps that we have to come up
3:15:23
with I think we'll just have to prepare really focus on the
3:15:28
draft and that's the end of the interview with Smash and back to the space thank
3:15:34
you thank you very much dear aaya as it is a 2-1 Victory a nailbiter in
3:15:41
something rare that we don't get to see in the 2025 season of League of Legends it going very very late where both barin
3:15:48
and Aon were up at the same time on the top side of the map welcome back to space Deon alongside with did and
3:15:53
chronicler to break down that fantastic series that we had yeah depending on
3:15:58
your read on the draft which I think we collectively agreed was win lane or lose game for geneng I'm shocked that the
3:16:05
game lost it as long as it did so if you're a geneng fan you can take that as soless the reality unfortunately is that
3:16:11
we kind of see the same struggles as in game number one canyon just looking completely off chovi missing a couple
3:16:18
and I think he had a relatively good game here but missing a couple of key skill shots and being the one to go down in the final fight um ruler I think had
3:16:25
a much harder game to play in this than in some of the others sequences so I think he he gets a little bit of a uh of
3:16:32
a pass from me but man T1 the team fighting and the debut of Smash has been
3:16:37
an absolute pleasure to watch I mean we already agreed on that uh draft Gap was on point I think geni played really well
3:16:44
even though they had a rough draft oh dear and also on top of that sorry I got
3:16:50
something stuck in my Thro that should yeah I mean on top of that I think they were kind of unlucky as well in the ear
3:16:56
earing phase uh we could see it from the replay as well I think uh especially
3:17:02
Canyon had really rough start uh since level one right all right let's take a look at the player of the match votes
3:17:09
how did we go here 10 of 11 one dissenting Daniel Ox harison the
3:17:14
sausages in the chat no no cost k w that's based owner owner was owner was
3:17:21
the one that won him this game by the way owner's engage on ruler was what set up like smash played amazingly how did
3:17:27
you just vote how did you vote well because I still think smash over the series was the guy that I'm going to go
3:17:32
for but like if you look back if owner doesn't Force those sums and gets that engage at that exact point smash K kill
3:17:39
ruler and the play doesn't work I think that if you look at the comp as well owner is their only form of engage and
3:17:44
he has been playing incredible against one of the best junglers in the world who currently I think also isn't looking
3:17:50
like that I think Kan has just not had the greatest season so far but owner definitely has I mean it's not a simple
3:17:56
game plan that you have to look for uh Jinx who is getting like uh defensed by
3:18:02
thrash and also lein and UD at the same time and it's really hard it's really
3:18:07
rough but he landed some good engages so that's why it happened all right what did you guys put in there I mean yeah I
3:18:13
told you I mean we we know that smash is playing really well but also at the same
3:18:19
time we have to shout out all the different players in T1 as well like K he's Landing so many good engages and
3:18:25
also Lulu again yeah you almost voted level twoo yeah I almost voted for K too like his poppy game was been has been
3:18:32
really great and also a Lulu game in the early game he almost solo killed lein
3:18:37
and he actually made that and I think that difference and in the early game made huge uh big deal in this game yeah
3:18:45
the big thing here is that you can see T1 become a team as a yeah I couldn't resist you know smash smash jokes cuz he
3:18:52
has been smashing he's been amazing but it's also the transformation of T1 with
3:18:58
two new players coming in into what now looks and feels and obviously they're still the Freeman core of K owner and
3:19:05
Faker all of which I think right now are also playing great but you can really see them gel together in real time and
3:19:10
it's always a pleasure to watch teams kind of go for the process yeah let's see how the Korean side took a look at
3:19:15
some of these plays yep smashy as he's uh surprising people while uh breaking down the Gen G Hearts
3:19:25
uh Pony going with if you're good at LOL you're my young and smashes become
3:19:30
my yeah that's a that's a typical Korean meme you know if you're good at League of Legends it doesn't matter how old old
3:19:37
you are you're just my young you know you're just my brother older brother that's how it works I mean he's got a
3:19:42
lot of youngs on that team that now are calling him young according to Pony an amazing Lon Messi cosplay by Cloud
3:19:50
Templar uh goat apparently a smash is S Plus Messi so it's like Sashi you know
3:19:57
Korean but that's how it goes I did not clock that one at all I just thought he was good at the
3:20:04
game yeah and also like whenever you remember when he's on Prime with Messi
3:20:10
the strategy in Barcelona was just basically just pass on Messi and you're
3:20:15
done you know like it's just look at at him and he's going to do it that's right set up set up the Messi of T1 you'd
3:20:21
imagine that would be Faker but no according to Cloud Templar it it's it's actually smashy uh let's take a look at
3:20:27
some of the highlights here early on in this game number three we're looking at jungle this is actually really tragic
3:20:33
right and I think Canyon had a rough game outside of this but this is such a tilter cuz it looks like he gets the
3:20:38
East SM timing perfectly at 60 free and still owner's Auto gets it right and
3:20:44
like him unironically him not getting getting the Raptor ends up being game losing because him not getting the
3:20:49
Raptor means that right here he's not level three which means that K can just bully him and then he dies and this geni
3:20:57
composition and as much Flack as we gave to UD and I think deservedly so this is
3:21:02
feels like you have pryo in every single lane cuz you outrange bot you have udir
3:21:07
who should be winning the 1 V one and he got an early kill as well and then you way you can generate pryo in mid and
3:21:13
then you get this uh this setup and then instead smash gets early kills which
3:21:19
leads to this 2v2 which basically means from the entire game they're on the back foot and I'm not going to lie Duro has
3:21:25
an excuse today uh that old had to hit from Rulo we can't miss those you need
3:21:31
to hit those and smash just straight up outplay them today I think in all the games I mean you can say a little bit of
3:21:37
unlucky moment happened but those kind of small details and also small victories uh kind of snowballed in this
3:21:44
game especially well speaking of small Det TS this one was a tough fight for T1 to get into but they find the angle
3:21:51
through owner and smash closes the door I mean smash was like already looking for the plays here uh I think uh they
3:21:57
all knew that uh what they need to do in this team fight they just need to jump into ruler if they look for just normal
3:22:05
front to back team fight I don't think there is a chance for T1 but I think that was just so hard to look at it but
3:22:12
it was just so clean by Smash as well it's one of the things that with Zer you need to really be on point with and
3:22:17
particularly feder you have so much power in these situations the fact that ruler like owner gets him he gets body
3:22:24
blocked by Aon and then he just does to kind of walk around smash gets access through the baron pit uh and from that
3:22:29
point on again I think ji did a good job of stalling but this is kind of where the game was done and then chovi got so
3:22:36
close and I I really want to kind of highlight how close this game still was as we go to the final moment because
3:22:44
specifically chovy right here is like 100 gold away and if he can get death
3:22:50
cap it's not enough but that is I think why he's so desperate why he's this far up and why he ends up just straight up
3:22:56
dying to smash is because one more wave and he can fight he has teleport he can
3:23:01
fight for that Dragon and death capap is so insane and he just doesn't get there and the game is done yeah the whole
3:23:06
point of this part is that Jeni's game plan was just getting Deca basically so
3:23:12
he was on gold yeah like he he had like 700 800 is so like it was only one wave
3:23:19
like after those moment but they couldn't get it in time so that's why he was kind of desperate but I think after
3:23:25
that his positioning was kind of off yeah he gets caught there smash with the decisive move and T1 take the victory as
3:23:33
we take a look at the standings now a top of group Baron it is T1 they are 4-
3:23:38
one they still will have to play in the plans but they have now locked the number one seed in plans with Hana life
3:23:44
as number two and DRX as number three after that game and all this is setting up for for bro to get another upset win
3:23:52
because if DK is the only team that goes undefeated I I I won't know what to do with myself that's right guys you know
3:23:58
what time it is the waiting room is over oh no no no it's bro time baby they're
3:24:05
up against The Undefeated D plus Kia big tall tesk we'll see how they do in the
3:24:10
next do like that

3:36:42
[Music] welcome back ladies and gentlemen to the
3:36:48
lck cup we just had an absolute bar burner of a first series here T1 coming
3:36:53
out Victorious over geneng but it was a difficult and hard fought battle what if
3:36:58
I was to tell you that that was not even the best matchup that we had today what if I was to tell you that now the big
3:37:05
game Hunters themselves are out for fresh meat and that is the Bros up
3:37:11
against DK arguably the best team in the competition right now
3:37:16
we had a nice warm up absolutely they opening opening act definitely definitely did his job uhhuh we're at
3:37:22
the meat and potatoes now though we definitely are and I want to shout out Leo 074 0741 125 in the chat if you are
3:37:30
there if you could play pay your brox to make sure this is as competitive as possible that goes for everyone as well
3:37:37
but seemed like Leo really had it dialed in that win against gen ear came in the right time but I think it just
3:37:43
demonstrated the true factual power of the brox uh if you were a Data before
3:37:48
you're now believe and you know based on things like scores and win loss and
3:37:53
points yes t+ is significantly at of bro but uh this is about Vibes and also this
3:38:00
is about a repeat of the Kasper Cup Final and that's not even a meme ladies and gentlemen because in that final both
3:38:07
of the teams were Fielding their lck rosters it was a 3-1 best of five not
3:38:13
even close the Giga Chad destroyed them and so DK a lot to prove if they want to
3:38:20
be able to take them down at the second time of asking in a very high pressure situation and here it is right here the
3:38:26
2024 Kasper Cup finals rematch and DK definitely out for
3:38:32
Revenge yep I mean the chance to go undefeated in your group is obviously massive uh bro unfortunately not able to
3:38:39
move any higher but they can keep themselves ahead of dnf um in their
3:38:44
group but at the end of the day this is about Pride uh something that brow has a lot of they do but uh yeah de I I think
3:38:51
you said it before I've been saying it deep CLA over their form I mean it's no surprise cuz of 40 but they have looked
3:38:58
like the strongest lck team they have and it is kind of mind-blowing you know a team that has Barrel on it um who has
3:39:05
been up and down they've got a brand new player in sh as well on the top side who has looked brilliant but this is the
3:39:12
Giga Chads you can see it right there Brion big letters undefeated streak breaking
3:39:18
Specialists bro and can they do it against DK here once again seems like
3:39:24
bro are just the bane of the group Elder undefeated teams hanuk 10 to 15 as far
3:39:30
as their head-to-head record going into Challenger as well these were the two without a doubt best junglers in the
3:39:36
league yeah um when they were both there and I'm going to be honest I am super hyped for this matchup because handback
3:39:41
Le in performance oh God was one of the best games I've seen in years because
3:39:46
we've seen great Lee but like his impact in fights past the point where you and it wasn't like just one fight like I
3:39:52
feel like Canyon had that one moment where he found like every kick angle possible but that was one moment whereas
3:39:58
hok did it all game and the thing is that's what you expect from Le like it's a late game I'll get a big kick my team will do the no no no no no he's like I
3:40:05
I'm I'm diving in I'm doing the damage I'm the carry it was honestly insane it was so good so I'm really hyped for this
3:40:12
match up and you couple that with lucid's Lilia performance for example where he was just the main character for
3:40:17
the entire game like and winning absolutely everywhere this is going to be hype and it's starting off with
3:40:23
Morgan and Shu leading the charge as both of the teams make their
3:40:29
way out will DK be able to hold on to their undefeated streak or are they shook from the loss in the Casper Cup
3:40:37
finals you can see there was some higher spirits but also some wey faces on the
3:40:42
side of D plus K I think they know that they should be the better team here today but anything can happen especially
3:40:50
when the Bros are around hands in let's see how this one's going to go as the Giga Chads versus
3:40:58
barrels band of merry men and you know barl has kind of got the craziness out of the way you know he
3:41:05
got aiming killed in the first match and like has done a few weird things so far in this tournament and uh Polo's debut
3:41:13
uh anniversary is today as well that's what those fans were holding up there very very cool yeah Max I'm I'm have toe
3:41:19
you say car's gotten the craziness out of the way there is no end he is a I mean it's true but like the excessive
3:41:25
craziness that works in a negative way maybe has dissipated somewhat he's just been tapering right he's just been
3:41:32
refining he's just been you know I mean the perfect amount of craziness I mean
3:41:37
if you're not smart enough you can't see the difference between crazy and genius Orcs it's so true it's so true you know
3:41:44
some people have watched barel play and I've seen people say how has this guy won WS twice well he has wouldn't get it
3:41:51
yeah exactly wouldn't get it okay and you might call it results based analysis but we have a different word for that on
3:41:56
this broadcast yeah outcome Focus assessments exactly and that is actual
3:42:02
gigabrain stuff right there um this is actually so much fun these are like my two favorite teams that we have in the
3:42:07
lck I'm so excited I know that that might make me sound a little bit biased but they're just really fun to watch I love how you say two favorite teams your
3:42:14
two favorite teams always grow and whichever team has a barrel yeah absolutely I'm not difficult to
3:42:21
read it's especially nice when barl is back home of course uh on his original
3:42:26
roster where he was able to claim that first world title on alongside that guy that was just on your screen there uh
3:42:31
showmaker I think this guy's also got a bunch of pressure on him as well hype has been so good um KT obviously um
3:42:39
seething a little bit at the fact that they loaned him out because they could probably use him I'll only say one thing
3:42:44
good thing was alone oh yeah mag him um
3:42:49
yeah I mean I feel like de de have just looked so good and for the longest time you know since D+ lost their support
3:42:56
they had when they W in WS they've been trying to replace him find someone who can be that shot caller and they have
3:43:02
yeah they replaced barrel with Barrel that's the best replacement it's it's w no one's going to judge them for that
3:43:08
one you can't say that it's better or worse it's just barrel and he's up against this guy right here I think
3:43:13
Polo's had some up and downs y I feel like we were we were sort of riding the polo hyp train and then it fed and fell
3:43:19
off a cliff a bit but he's climbing back up you know like that scene in Game of Thrones where they're climbing over the wall I think he's like halfway up
3:43:26
something like that and also I mean uh I mean we talked about play half ups and down keep bring it back to Barrel
3:43:33
but if he's to support goat maybe you're supposed to have up and downs I mean if you're taking a leaf out
3:43:40
of the barrel book I don't know whether you're it it's it could be a good IDE it
3:43:45
could be a bad idea maybe barl is the only one that can ever make that style of play work it's an idea yeah it is uh it's the theory it's the vibe it's Maro
3:43:52
I don't know I don't know whether anyone is going to get that movie reference that is a deep cut and very Australian
3:43:57
but uh this is indeed where Legends are born it's on bro and Morgan has been
3:44:03
their lead man for so so many years feels like he's the last remaining
3:44:09
original gigachad you know we had you know LOL King lava there in the mid lane in the past we had umpty of course the
3:44:16
general leading the charge we had henna and where's he gone
3:44:21
you know there's A's a lot of names that have been and gone here for bro but Morgan is forever Y and The Vibes are
3:44:28
Eternal they they can change the players it's still grown mhm well they're going
3:44:33
to be banning away the NY and the rumble to start us off here pron on the blue side with that slide Advantage given the
3:44:39
fact that scarner and kist need to be banned every single game that mistake was made hok does have
3:44:46
a game on scner he doesn't have a definable KDA though if I remember correctly yeah dying too much going to
3:44:53
band the air away from closer VAR still up Ash still up Jace still up lot of the
3:44:58
power picks I feel like maybe if you want that Jace you can pick up now uh probably would get traded for a Cante
3:45:03
though uh so they end up just going instead for the vi prioritizing uh a pick that can really shut down I mean
3:45:10
against aiming a lot of value and now it's up to D+ do you want the Jace or do you want the cassant I think ultimately
3:45:17
the Jace has a stronger overall power level it does because it's so flexible and this is how DK have been drafting
3:45:23
right they draft for Flex for uh getting all of that extra you know draft power
3:45:28
that you claim from it but instead the strength of the cassant is going to ring true will be the Varys locked in there
3:45:34
as well and Vitalia is standing out like a sore thumb but closer can go towards something more assassin based right like
3:45:41
LeBlanc could come in here like there are so many options Ari fantastic a
3:45:46
Aurora game lot of options there especially when you know you're going into an mobile lady carry and you have someone to back you up to lock them down
3:45:53
uh do also think that if they do want the Jace they could lean towards that in this rotation not now they instead go
3:45:59
for the Elise prioritizing that from hu I feel like this is a pick away Baris Elise is very very strong yeah uh and
3:46:07
Barrel is kind of crazy and also manages to win games even if he dies nine times
3:46:13
so they're going to take that one away from him so certainly pick composition well and truly on the cards like closer
3:46:18
locks anari in here and cocon into charm is so dangerous if they do make that happen but instead like you were talking
3:46:24
about the J going to be picked up does give them a bunch of extra range that flexibility like we were talking about still applies yeah I think they figured
3:46:30
that you know there's enough mid picks that we can take that we're fine we need to secure this Jace uh so strong shower
3:46:36
was jealous man so today what is able to do and now over the de here I think
3:46:41
securing a jungle jungler here we have to see jungle pool there is th out quite quickly um in the draft what about um
3:46:50
the jungle pool and support pool at the same time being thinned out yeah well you covered both bases they have the flexibility with this one I do think
3:46:56
it's really stronger in the jungle uh to no surprise but have the option there if
3:47:01
they want to go in another Direction and it does make it a bit trickier for bro to ban now they do ban the Aurora away
3:47:07
from Clos I think that makes complete sense y um he had a insane game on that
3:47:12
pick and do you ban an 8 carry next just because you can't ban both arri and LeBlanc from uh from closer and also
3:47:19
you're not even sure whether he's going to be just not playing the Jace I think you if you're really concerned
3:47:26
about something like like ash is still open and has been left available you could definitely take away that they end up going for kaisa makes sense with the
3:47:32
vi oh this also deters them from flexing as well um less options as far as uh AP
3:47:39
Champions on the bottom side zig's still up and available but a different play style right y yeah I mean you can still follow up when you dive in but Zig is a
3:47:46
very goofy Lane yeah um the zillian ban ladies and gentlemen I mean honestly
3:47:53
makes sense when you think about what it can offer to the team and how it can pair up with Pantheon and how they've already played it from showmaker so yeah
3:48:01
think should respect that one well he now has to give himself away this would be a lot of Lane power as we
3:48:07
have seen the karma picked into the elas before and that will be happening once again Barrel's Karma doesn't exactly
3:48:12
fill me with joy but we'll see what what is going to come of it as saving showmakers pick until last we'll have
3:48:19
confirmation as to where the Jace is going at that point but man this pick comp is really coming together pick and
3:48:24
poke here for ok Savings Bank Brion as that AR that we were talking about we're
3:48:31
expecting that one to be pretty high priority and that will be picked up so the hanuk closer combo is in full force
3:48:37
here for this game and there is a gin or an ash like both of them fit this composition
3:48:43
gorgeously on Brook side and I feel like once again blue side and like making the
3:48:49
perfect archetypical uh draft Yeah is once again uh ringing
3:48:55
true yeah it's going to be difficult to see how bro can protect their varus in this situation and what they end up
3:49:01
picking for showmaker a lot of threats coming in here the silus pick makes complete sense uh good value with both
3:49:07
the uh vile the Ariel and the ashel and you also options oh there's the Swain so
3:49:13
it's it's one of show AK favorites if we remember all the way back to Worlds a few years ago is Swain
3:49:21
absolutely dominating this is the guy that really put Swain on the map here for our lck midlaners and is continuing
3:49:27
to find success on it yeah I think Swain is a pick where you know in the right situation is just so valuable so strong
3:49:35
but also can be quite Feast of famine if he's behind you can burst through him before he really gets out value if he's
3:49:40
a head he just feels Immortal and you're playing into a comp where they have to dive into you it's almost definitely
3:49:45
going to be a poke virus he's going to be sitting a long range firing off these arrows the job of Bon is to close the distance and engage and you're diving
3:49:52
into a Swain you're diving into Cante a Pantheon this doesn't feel that good but
3:49:57
that that's what your comp is locked into so I think it makes a lot of sense uh also kind of eliminates you as a Target so sorry aiming you are now y
3:50:04
you're the target maybe Barrel as well um but yeah I think it it does what de+
3:50:10
need to sort of round out that composition they are very much playing the anti-d play style into what uh bro
3:50:16
have yeah bro do have a lot of sort of ranged keep away that they can play around as well Jay a fair bit of range
3:50:23
as well it's just like you were saying Ahi wanting to be going forward VI is always going to be going forward I think
3:50:30
so they can play around with it if they if they fire like an ash Arrow into a charm into a cocoon you can deal with
3:50:35
swaying Without Really committing yeah which is a lot of power so yeah they definitely have that aspect to the composition some chain CC available here
3:50:42
for the gigachad we'll see how they do against an undefeated D+ we jump on the
3:50:51
[Applause]
3:50:58
rift I don't know whether you guys can hear it that clearly at home but the the fan chant leader for D+ sounds about as
3:51:05
unhinged as he absolutely should being a fan of this team um certainly very very
3:51:11
much giving the right energy as they make their way through aiming and Lucid sitting on top of a ward here right now
3:51:18
as barrel with a very old skin um for K actually was a release release Karma Su
3:51:25
goddess Karma or something like that oh was the other one he had okay yeah was a good one it was like the release skin
3:51:31
that no one used it's like the secondary one everyone used the dark purple one and I don't remember the name of that
3:51:37
but anyway I liked it and uh so did Barrel so there we go let's see how this one goes we can
3:51:44
see Lane swap has come on through as hype and Polo are moving towards the top side
3:51:50
yeah I I think it makes sense as well the varus karma level one is so obnoxious um and the thing with the
3:51:55
lease is you don't really have that much trading power in terms of like you can fire your Q off but you're outrange by
3:52:01
the karma you kind of need level three really to to just look for an Allin if you want to have pressure so the swap
3:52:08
makes sense uh bro already leashing some XP towards Morgan in the mid lane it's
3:52:13
exactly what we saw from Doran T1 earlier on today as aiming and Barrel with a free Lane here on the bottom side
3:52:19
just going to shove this one in sh doing his very best to pick up some minions and there is a lot of parallels between
3:52:25
game one of our previous series and this one um outside of the fact that ouru hasn't been able to get the first uh
3:52:31
round of minions and all that experience as Lucid here towards the bottom side is going to be just stealing away the enemy
3:52:37
jungle one after the other yeah and then not want to put the Jace in a bot to set up for dive it's no longer uh they
3:52:44
changed it you can't block tower hits with your Pantheon e which made him so insane at Dives but he's still pretty good at them yeah um and this is where
3:52:51
it's a tough decision Morgan's just going to force him out yeah so he just Dives in in fact if a vault breaker
3:52:57
connects could be real dangerous sh has to flash they'll take that and bro also zoning him off an entire wave of minions
3:53:06
y in the meantime of course this wave of minions is also going to go down so as far as the trade is concerned it's
3:53:11
really not a huge deal until plates come into the equation yeah it definitely this gives an advantage towards de
3:53:17
Plus's bot lane cuz it's only two of them getting the XP they're getting a bit more gold but it really means this
3:53:23
Top Lane match up is going to be really advantageous for Morgan and especially as the Jace like earlier when we saw it
3:53:29
it was the Cante having the advantage over Daren on the Jace and you can't really do that much with it you're just
3:53:35
tankier right but Jace can really apply a lot of pressure in the match up if he does start snowball and gets ahead and
3:53:41
then still ends up just being really tanky in the latest stages well and see in the mid lane showmaker
3:53:47
and closer just trading Farm very much looking forward to seeing whether this Swain is going to get more done than the
3:53:53
first time we saw it here in the lck cup I believe it was bdd and just wasn't able to get off the ground the Swain
3:53:58
kind of did less than nothing um in that match and we I felt like it left us
3:54:05
wanting more you know I feel like you want to see those big demon flares you know that big value um we get that I I
3:54:12
love the fights where he's just oh well sha going to get cocoon there's the charm the layering is gorgeous as
3:54:17
lucid's going to come in sha drinking the Potion No actually hadn't had it
3:54:23
because he'd already drank it but not quite enough damage there so Shaker makes it out flash now down yep super
3:54:28
close Lucid coming by I think really avoided that being more cuz I could have seen them maybe flashing in diving
3:54:34
looking to finish off the kill but Lucid will Ward them away but a good start puts showmaker on the back foot allows
3:54:40
Clos to push the wave in and takes away that flash so just a nice use of the
3:54:45
time when you're leaving your ad carry to One V one and get extra now Morgan could be in I think he's just dead I
3:54:52
think he might be dead yeah uh by might like that is like he's dead as Barrel is
3:54:57
going to pick up the turret argro even throws Down The Cheeky little q and survives meanwhile on the other side of
3:55:03
the map it is a dead Cante as hype is oh calculated yep drink your potions I'm
3:55:09
pretty sure hype used the biscuit as well there yep I was thinking he's going to barrier doesn't have barrier this game so no the answer would be um yeah
3:55:17
both teams successfully pulling off their Dives but now I think you just have to go back towards Top Lane and we
3:55:23
should see normal Lanes returning here um overall you can see bot Lane aiming
3:55:28
is a bit ahead in terms of gold but not really that much yeah I think Morgan already taking so much poke here he
3:55:34
tries to clear out the wave fine but that means you don't actually have any abilities to use on barrel uh can just
3:55:40
kind of walk up and press W and here in return it's just you're against the lease it's no matter how well you play
3:55:47
it that's what's going to happen yep and the thing is even if hype died it wouldn't be ideal cuz You' miss the wave
3:55:52
but it didn't execute so would make that wasn't actually able to touch him so Morgan back up towards the Top Lane now
3:55:58
might actually be able to get some Farm as we can see here even evening things out against shes Cante both of them
3:56:05
sitting at 01 and zero so see when they can actually get something going for
3:56:10
themselves it's a tough time being a top laner here in the lck cup tell you that as barel all he picks the difference
3:56:17
between both of them and misses entirely you love to see it y level six this
3:56:22
gives a ton of power to Mid jungle 2v2 but then show make it hits a second later yeah I thought he was a bit
3:56:27
further behind when he got apparently not y he's fine so I both these Champions get an absurd amount of power
3:56:34
uh from that ult so definitely something to play around we see hanack going towards the grubs starting them up but
3:56:41
Barrel are moving over in response I remember Barrel's level five prob is level three oh that's going to be a
3:56:47
rough time as Lucid let's see whether he can lock down two of these does manage to get one here as huk goes in the flash
3:56:54
out from Lucid here is the Demonic Ascension and showmaker trying to get work done as the repel brings po up and
3:57:01
he makes it out still showmaker just pushing them all away and Sh going to be able to grab his kill as the elast does
3:57:08
go down Barrel surprisingly is really far up in the enemy jungle um but he is
3:57:14
not going to be going down this time there go two of the grubs over to DK and two kills as well so they're one
3:57:20
away from a feed of strength two away here for bro if they can find it yeah the damage just wasn't there and they're focusing everything onto the Swain who's
3:57:27
so bulky uh just wasn't really going to work I think also Po got kind of unlucky
3:57:33
oh oh Arrow going to connect here onto showmaker he finds some Sith lightning onto highper as the never move pulls him
3:57:38
back but closer with that orb of deception is deceiving nobody cuz we knew exactly what was going to happen
3:57:43
there and he takes down the Swain yeah good moves finding an angle I mean the thing with Swain is without your he so
3:57:49
much weaker so it's a good angle to kind of make back what they lost in the fight oh she looking for another angle here as
3:57:55
they're both just diving forward you going to miss on the second time of asking is this is what I've missed Rags
3:58:00
yeah oh my God aiming the value what goes up must come down ladies
3:58:05
and gentlemen and aiming is going to kill the Elise 1 V2 I think hype might
3:58:12
have just trolled po a little bit there um definitely the plan was I'm going to repel out that minion yeah and then the
3:58:19
minion was was arrowed yeah so bit unfortunate bit of a lack of communication definitely po stepping up
3:58:27
a bit too far it feels like him being down XP you're feeling it already 021 although if you judge Things based on
3:58:33
the barrel book plays yeah he's got seven more deaths to go yes um he might be writing that in
3:58:40
all chat as well like Paulo you're doing great but you need to stick to it as we have a look at this replay one
3:58:46
more time is is some value of the Swain we will immediately follow this up with the not so much value of the SW Swain
3:58:52
but if he can get in the middle of these fights it does work out and you look at the repel from po I think he was trying to go to the grub but it was just out of
3:58:59
range so he ends up having to drop down in the middle and Flash away immediately if he could have gone to the grubs he probably would have just gotten out so
3:59:05
really unfortunate there but definitely bad Target s bro this was just showmaker
3:59:11
he wanted some honey frood sometimes you are just not allowed to eat the honey fruit this is you're not allowed to kill
3:59:18
the minions if your Elise needs to get out yeah aiming aiming you as well
3:59:24
just you did him dirty I mean he did him dirty but like Barrel was also coming down he had no
3:59:31
flash I think he was dead regardless um but still it was funny it was very funny all right there's the
3:59:38
Vault breaker Flash oh my God the kitchen sink what did he say to them I don't know I mean to Fair layering the
3:59:45
CC so we can't press R very important but also what did he say yeah I know um
3:59:51
well we'll be uh we'll be digging into that um to see what kind of uh insult showmaker has been throwing around as
3:59:58
we've got a q connecting on the hype oh God the pope from this Lane I'd forgotten just how filthy uh varas karma
4:00:04
is yeah it's pretty obnoxious and the least just isn't really doing anything to help you out here like at least in
4:00:11
this matchup you can if you can all in great if you can't all in you're just kind of sitting there
4:00:17
yeah and you can't all in you definitely cannot all in uh as that is going to be a second feet of strength so DK really
4:00:23
speedr running that one prior to 10 minutes even though it's only 2 seconds prior they will be able to lock that one
4:00:29
down yeah especially since you now need the three kills being a lot slower strength coming in yeah before you'd
4:00:36
sometimes have them before anyone even had the Tier Two Boots which funnily enough is actually the case here def
4:00:42
Plus have the piz okay barl just bought them he's like I'm immediately making the value of those yep getting the value
4:00:49
as all right hex flash over here from Paul is okay Shu decides to go aggressive all out onto Morgan but Po's
4:00:55
tanking the turret side steps the shock blast and po just misread that entirely
4:01:01
sorry side steps generous generous he definitely dodged it I'm not sure he had to step
4:01:07
anywhere some some whiff skill shots from bro there that the concept the idea I like it the exec little he were doing
4:01:14
a good job though of of trying to drag Morgan on a turret yeah but uh just a
4:01:20
shock blast was just like is there a Teemo there we don't see I mean there always is everything's separated by teos
4:01:27
is uh Lucy going to dive forward onto hok as once again it looks like bro just going to be able to get one out of the
4:01:33
three unless Arrow going to be connecting here onto the pantheon demonica sension but they just take down
4:01:39
the Spartan warrior right in front of them no Smite available but DK is still able to grab one of these grubs HBO
4:01:46
diving forward ceased assist into that backline as they're just trying to block it as aiming getting a fair few shots
4:01:53
through flashes out eventually but there goes the karma there goes the Swain and bro with a gorgeous team fight SE would
4:02:00
just played protect the president for aiming there and saved his life but it was still really well played by bro
4:02:06
initial CC on the pantheon not the S this time they wait out the swel they go for the re-engage they they're playing
4:02:12
the comp as they should be and kind of demonstrating why these scores are a bit fake I want to see this again because
4:02:18
the timing seems so perfect I mean it's a good initial play they get the arrow and hype is getting bullied out so often
4:02:25
but his arrows been so good they charm the follow up they get the kill they're like okay we're out Morgan even flashes
4:02:30
he just want to keep showmaker ult channeled and then I want to see this cuz see we see the ult come down and
4:02:35
aiming and like this flash that comes in and blocks the charm at the last second
4:02:41
oh so sick that was crazy like that could have been a lot more dire but yeah ends up saving Z carry still a bad fight
4:02:47
for D plus but uh the rookie top laner knows who pays the bills or gets paid in this
4:02:54
team he's saw the crown like that's that's sitting at the team house like he knows guy he know King is this guy's the
4:03:00
goal king that's the guy you want to impress because he will give you the cool presents if it's your birthday as
4:03:05
Shu now back towards his top side closer has been sort of the huge beneficiary of
4:03:10
everything uh so far in this game 24 CS more than anyone else on the map outside
4:03:17
of said gold King that one4 malignance in hand oh shoot it's such an insane
4:03:22
game by the way for hyp to be 204 and every time we've looked at him he's like
4:03:27
half HP getting bullied by a [Laughter] varus this time not hit by that hail of
4:03:34
arrows feel fantastic he 32 CS behind and that's uh doing more to demonstrate
4:03:41
uh the situation here as of course close to a 4 gold lead in favor of aiming that looks bad but then if you move your eyes
4:03:48
just slightly up towards the mid lane yeah swings and roundabouts yeah it
4:03:54
looks like the uh maybe it wasn't bdd maybe it was swing yeah still trying to
4:03:59
make SW work and I think the point you raised in drop though is really valid that bro can just fire all this CC at a
4:04:05
Target show it's not like showmaker canot ult you kind of have to ult when that happens but then they just pull
4:04:11
away just disengage then you wait out the AL you start fighting again it's why I think it would have been better if
4:04:16
they had Champions oh no we're zooming in h surprise showaker he is very dead
4:04:23
yeah and po going to pick up the kill not exactly ideal but they'll take the
4:04:28
turret yep it is bit of a struggle Street for the Swain um not giving him a
4:04:34
chance to ult not giving him a chance to heal and I think it's why SW into melee Champions is really good like if there was like a
4:04:39
Gallo things like Wukong yeah really I mean even in VI still good but it's
4:04:45
just can't do anything it's yeah it's a feast of f pick you're 0 four you're going to die in one rotation and then
4:04:51
you don't get to do anything or you Ally so you don't die and then they just run away well they're praying for a mid game
4:04:59
that is not with a whole lot of action um I believe as now aiming walking
4:05:05
towards hype he went the edge of Knight first really does not want to uh take any of this cc is pretty free flowing on
4:05:12
the side of bro it's good against like K and it's good against arrows deceptively oh he's oh no yeah she is in a bunch of
4:05:20
trouble but Lucid comes down as well Morgan going to be taken out the arrow sails by majestically and bro just lose
4:05:27
their top laner and closer now also might find himself out of position his teleport awkward position there but does
4:05:34
have to use the AL uses it to get out of the way of the ultimate flying at him from aiming so trades one for one as far as that is concerned and now DK can get
4:05:41
themselves this fiery Dragon this is a great strategy from D+ so what they do is they fight around the four people on
4:05:46
the bot side of the maph and just don't have showmaker there yeah and then showmaker can try
4:05:53
and get the heck back into the game yeah and ultimately you're not relying on this uh slightly weak Swain 181 gold
4:06:01
that was by the way I'm glad we saw that and he's just giggling about as
4:06:06
well he's like v no Al after having a l at least ignite as
4:06:12
well by the way you there we go um always going to look at the positives yeah I mean he's just so
4:06:18
tanky the old comes in from Lucid instantly just bur down this J is not that tanky yet the arrow unfortunately a
4:06:23
little bit late uh rare Miss from hype on that one and they end up getting the dragon specifically because they get
4:06:30
that advantageous Play Ooh Orcs we haven't seen this kch soul in quite some
4:06:35
time I've been trying hard I know we in the replay so yeah couldn't pay attention it's not your fault I was
4:06:41
watching the replay you know um I'm kind of into it I'm I wouldn't mind a Mega Blast cone or two this game you know so
4:06:48
that's what we're going to be doing alz would be so upset I know doing somewhere
4:06:53
um hopefully he can just look at Bryce and feel happy yep might be able to do that as all right the two archers here
4:07:01
in this mid lane it's like I'm watching Brave absolutely fastic this cam Tech Sol is so bad for D+ because you're in a
4:07:08
situation where you're down in Gold but you have these two early dragons and you low R quite hard but I will say as far
4:07:15
as compositions go you do have quite a durable composition Swain and Cante well
4:07:21
with it you also have a decent amount of shielding from the karma healing from the Swain so it's not like the worst
4:07:26
it's like as far as coms go with chch soul it's a decent com to have chch soul but it is definitely still a weak soul
4:07:32
and D+ we definitely hoping for like a hex deck or something that would make their early investment pay off a lot
4:07:38
more and also I mean I think the main thing that they want is for sh to not be 60c s behind as well as 04 it's all bad
4:07:45
news allk the gold lead um the good news is the gold King is doing what he's
4:07:52
supposed to which is having gold so he's got two items now complete I think that's the thing is this bro lineup Clos
4:07:59
and handback I feel like have been such a shining light oh yeah the aggression needs to have the confidence and despite
4:08:04
being a new pairing playing so well together and especially cuz this is something we really play H praise lucid
4:08:10
and showmaker for when they started being a jeers looks really good together a lot of games at D+ one on the back of
4:08:16
these two and now they're going up against the new kids the new is Cante broken enough I guess we're not going to
4:08:22
find out because bro thinks he absolutely is he is so tanky right now um there's a lot of armor shred on bro
4:08:28
to be fair with the Black Cleaver from Jace and there's a little natural armor shred from both Jace and by but I don't
4:08:35
think it's enough no I just think you can let him do his thing and hopefully
4:08:40
you don't you can just kill everyone else and and hope he doesn't kill your team that's what's sort of happening
4:08:46
here having a look at the Gold about 2.5k um it's a good lead for bro and I
4:08:51
feel like their composition will be able to snowball this quite nicely especially with the siege that they have available
4:08:56
Siege is something that we don't talk about as much these days cuz I feel like it's a lot of dive and poke and setup
4:09:01
and stuff like that that we've been seeing but this composition sieges really well Arrow going to be flying through and that interrupts the back on
4:09:09
this Cante and now maybe they can kill him he doesn't find the Q as now looking to get on top of huk who
4:09:15
just says no I'm going to Vault break you po comes in just to make sure that they're going to go down and she will
4:09:22
fall hp's arrows has just been so good um see unfortunately not using the W to block it out but there was so much cc to
4:09:28
come in maybe you could done that you would just got be chased been chased down afterwards H back did mess up the
4:09:34
uh Vault breaker a little bit over the wall regardless some good picks just helping to extend that Goldie for bro
4:09:39
and this should lead to a tower as well yeah be the first but but going to be
4:09:45
pushing in and it looks like the Kasper Cup champions not wanting to let DK
4:09:50
forget about how that one went as Clos are going to help lock that one down 105
4:09:56
now on this Ari he is definitely the scariest on the map right now but huk as
4:10:02
well 303 this VI very scary two items now complete I mean lucid's only got
4:10:07
like a toy sword and a rock in comparison to the Black Cleaver and especially I feel like VI is one of these Champions where when you get fed
4:10:13
like she's still valuable even if she's not when you get fed she becomes kind of obnoxious spamming her q and just not
4:10:19
taking damage uh and Pantheon no one has ever picked Pantheon I think don't worry
4:10:24
guys said I I'm going to scale on the lake that has never been a thing ever no um even before the rework at any
4:10:30
iteration of Pantheon so not ideal um I don't think Luc had a bad game as such but it just you know jungles rely a lot
4:10:37
on Mid and mid uh mid isn't here mid's a little Boom at the moment not mentally you know
4:10:44
still vibing still having a good time just uh little bit of score line damage I would say the score line damage is a a
4:10:50
very nice way of little bit of 60 CS godam it's a fair bit of uh well a
4:10:56
lack of Cs damage I guess but um yeah the mental taking a hit shock blast
4:11:01
going to be avoided there very nicely from DK H looking to take the first chem quad chem Tech chemtech Soul Man on the
4:11:08
cards some big shields you know that's kind of the the tragic thing uh I mean sorry that's the good thing rather about
4:11:14
the tank Jace is that you don't need to hit your shock blast you know it doesn't matter if you it wasn't doing damage anyway yeah they'd be able to do
4:11:20
anything oh look we have a little graphic just if you guys 500 away from being gold King aiming if you weren't
4:11:26
aware by the way CL is very far ahead of show me if this if you if you weren't
4:11:31
able maybe you're in a neck brace and you can't look down Aon that was a scouting Arrow um
4:11:38
the E does that as well but may have not had the charges if you're if you have a NE so maybe the bottom of your screen is
4:11:44
broken like you spilled something got it you can now see to the left that there is a
4:11:50
massive closer and it's just not really getting better I mean I guess it's still 60 uh
4:11:57
as far as CS so yeah let's keep it at 60 should I make eventually if we just keep
4:12:04
going everyone will get full build you know so there you go item advantages aren't real when everyone has their
4:12:10
items and you know you you'll have a a poke varus and a a Pantheon notorious
4:12:16
late game I mean to be fair po varus can still do some work L game we saw him
4:12:21
Slayer Dragon that one time we did um we've also seen you know players like Viper use it in the ultra late game to
4:12:28
like solo win games I it's still good and there's not that many tanky people on bro um so it's not like
4:12:35
the oh we are outon oh this is sneaky this is very I they did see the spider
4:12:41
though and they did see the Cocoon and they saw the ward so I don't think D I think D+ are clued in ladies and gents
4:12:48
as chains of corruption and huk was just standing there ladies and gentlemen he will get stunned up and then poked in
4:12:54
the back and that is lucid to lock that one down no jungler no chance of stopping this Aon unless they all group
4:13:01
up and try and go 4v5 but that will be a big old gamble Arrow going to connect there as it lands
4:13:08
on to Lucid he does get freed is now closer dancing around the fight they take down the cassant to start this one
4:13:14
off can do it that is going to Bean taken and now they can take a very short trip homean surviving for so long aiming
4:13:21
going to lock down the kill and very quickly they take 400 gold from all of them yeah that doesn't feel nearly 200
4:13:28
gold from all uh it doesn't feel nearly as good as it used to with the amount of gold that bro actually get from those kills you know I'm not going to sit here
4:13:34
and say this was bad for D+ um the first pick is obviously initially great and they get the attan they had no right to
4:13:40
do so with this deficit but they're not going to get any value from the B um
4:13:45
well apart from the fact that they didn't get aced immediately afterwards sure but it's not they can do anything with it um so if we actually keep track
4:13:53
of the gold a little bit the Aron Lucid is fine we see see we doing a good job of blocking off but closes damage is God
4:13:59
it's insane and the thing is they get him before the attam buff so got full gold
4:14:05
for him and then they're just picking up extra gold here at sure on the other
4:14:11
side you do see like bit of Gold return from those kills but I think bro are actually pretty happy with all that
4:14:16
panned out 100% and the thing is as much as adakan is ready great to get if you're ahead you know deep no longer
4:14:23
have that as like a comeback oh good side step there as Arrow still going to connect tomok making his way over not
4:14:30
actually overc committing to this one as oh po almost just explodes as into the
4:14:35
backline goes the vi maybe bit too far but there's so much damage my God the Bros just tidy it up Barrel also not
4:14:42
going to be safe one more charge left in that Spirit Rush as you can see Deon going
4:14:48
absolutely ballistic here as they push up once again the inner turret going to be taken down and the inhibitor turret
4:14:56
as well should follow suit DK can they defend it looks like
4:15:02
they're not going to defend this inhibitor not going to be losing the game right now 6,000 gold though and
4:15:08
with this composition that scales a little bit better than their opponents looking real good I love the patience
4:15:13
here you know they're threatening constantly and deep plus like trying to position to help and they just keep throwing skill shots aiming moves back
4:15:20
cuz he thinks he's got the least repel comes through old from handback is beautiful and then Morgan he's just on
4:15:25
top of them yeah he's just driving forwards I just it's so nice to see it's not just that like this bro team are
4:15:32
playing well but the way they play the the shared aggression is something that I feel like this team this organization
4:15:38
has been missing for a while it's the coordination and this is something that bro has able to do in the early stages
4:15:44
of games so often is bro ordination sorry yes um yeah and the and the positivity um and all of that stuff as
4:15:53
DK back out onto the map somewhat as chains of corruption going to connect that's going to grab a cleanse but the
4:16:00
arrow comes in Lucid now looking to switch targets here as they dive towards huk never move it's good and they take
4:16:05
down the jungler as DK they've taken down the jungler before charm out from closer
4:16:11
doesn't really connect he's completely o which is not so great now without an
4:16:16
ultimate available wants to use that next charge does so true damage working very well bro definitely went ready for
4:16:22
a fight there and the aren confident enough to go for the bar on the back of this they will pick up the dragon but it's kch so you know it's a small
4:16:29
consolation prize uh and honestly bro can just take that top tier two probably
4:16:35
get some Vision around Baron reset and it's it's still a good play for D+ don't get me wrong but it's not going to
4:16:42
changed that much in this game yeah and you know they invested a whole bunch of ultimates as well and things like that as hyp is
4:16:49
starting the bar yeah i' say the biggest thing is the fact that they got hype Summoners if they capitalize on that that's pretty big but yeah they just
4:16:55
start up remember this is a blood the uh Ash and staying off the baron and
4:17:01
actually at least does a fair bit of damage to Baron even if she doesn't have like jungle items or anything well they
4:17:07
get the vision of it they're going to stick to it by the looks of things Morgan diving on in as well
4:17:13
this is certainly dangerous as Lucid going to move forward he can get into the pit can he get the steal that's the
4:17:20
question no they just burst him down the allout brings the jungler out of the pit it's down to 400 as he flashes back in
4:17:27
closer goes golden but he's going to get knocked back here Shu can you take down the mid laner the answer is no not quite
4:17:33
and the baron is secured by the pros just the confidence you know you have a player that goes badly you lose your
4:17:38
jungler you bounce back hype's like guys we can just Baron and they do and it works they managed to deal with lo as
4:17:45
well and it's it's once again his team knowing exactly how to play out the encounter we see this play ends up quite
4:17:51
messy hand back kind of peel for Z carry does end up paying for it uh and as you
4:17:56
said this is not a Time M want to be teing in B all this matter but here the patience they know Lu is coming in
4:18:02
they're not scared of him the charm does a great job of mitigating his pressure he drags hamach out the pit and H's like
4:18:08
no I'm securing it Y and aiming could have actually had the most you know single hit damage right with an
4:18:15
empowered q and so flashing back in for that definitely worthwhile here for hok
4:18:20
as bro I mean vision of Empire doing absolutely nothing here for showmaker and they're going to use this Baron bu
4:18:26
buff to push in this bottom Lane mid lane I mean it's still down for another minute and a half and so DK if they
4:18:34
weren't on the ropes before they certainly are now yeah and and this way is just so
4:18:40
useless oh so useless cler is so strong level 16 as well so max rank in the
4:18:45
ultimate means a cool down super short but also just doing a lot of extra damage shock blast you would like to hit
4:18:51
those on aiming to get the spell shield but it's not that Arrow going to be soaked here by the Swain maybe that's a good use that's your job yeah I feel
4:18:59
like it's not it's not even demonic Ascension anymore it's like demonic step ladder like only gets up one one little
4:19:06
bit yeah we're not we're not really ascending and not one of those tall step bladders like no yeah like the ones you
4:19:13
have when you it's it's the one your grand uses to to reach the the jam that's on the top shelf of the cupboard
4:19:19
yeah then unfortunately stumbled yeah well season assist into the backline aiming taken out of the fight as Lucid
4:19:25
soaking damage pretty well and that demonic step ladder is kind of doing things she is going to be able to take
4:19:31
one kill in this fight as po dipes up and then he comes back down they take
4:19:37
down the varis very comfortably in this CC layering one after the other the Bros
4:19:43
will just casually Walt towards a game one victory in this best of three blue
4:19:51
side is strong but man it was a dominant one here in game one and the thing is
4:19:56
despite the score lineing groups after the performance against gen and regardless of how the series goes the
4:20:02
performance now bro are looking like a real terror oh yeah a real threat there was a point during which after the first
4:20:08
week it was like are bro going to make it to the next stage yeah they lost against some of the teams and it look like they might end up up with the group
4:20:15
now you're hoping I mean it's too late now but you're hoping we do not want to face this team you wishing they had gone
4:20:20
out because bro taking names really good performance against D+ couple of hiccups but uh against a team of this caliber is
4:20:29
pretty insane BR taxes definitely getting their money's worth absolutely we saw it flying in of course we do need
4:20:36
more brox for game two as well uh especially because the look on bangi and haan's faces like aani was feeling a
4:20:42
little bit rough about it but bangi was still laughing still happy uh they know this the best of three you know going
4:20:49
into game two you'll have blue side they might be able to turn things around and then game three is kind of a free-for-all it's all about who has the
4:20:54
deeper Pockets so this game an amazing one for bro but they're not out of the woods 100% but I feel
4:21:01
like lck has so much been about the big four mid lane as everyone always talking poser honestly outperformed chovy when
4:21:08
they played gen just I mean it wasn't SW but just outperform chaker that he is looking really good and try to break
4:21:13
into that top four well let's see whether he can do it with a win after this it is going to be a short break for us the space is going to break it down
4:21:20
with a very happy Deon and then we will have game two
4:21:25
[Music]
4:21:33
[Music]
4:21:46
[Music]
4:21:57
not
4:22:18
last and
4:22:33
only SHO
4:22:40
[Music]
4:23:11
I'm for
4:23:43
that edge of KN is so important to deal with is now h on a flank angle they haven't dealt with the wave just
4:23:50
yet this there flanks upon flanks flanks wave is crashing as well did they go
4:23:56
yeah Morgan's making his way around the ulti comes down from closer huk misses the que though as CZ goes in closer is
4:24:02
the one in trouble but he lands the combo and it does so much damage cuz has to flash for it and now docked on on top
4:24:08
of hype dock on maybe the hero for KT has Morgan in the river by himself now H
4:24:15
po picked up by
4:24:22
B what can they find can they get on top of Las Ste remember Rich does not have a
4:24:28
splash angle here on a dooo but sponge is kind of going for a walk on the left side he's so tanky though you again he
4:24:35
going to fight in the front line massive Oriana ultimate but it's just there's no followup he catches a lot but the DP has
4:24:42
in there DRX are too far ahead and utal has put on a show once
4:24:53
again he's got his in the wrong position yeah I'm like everybody except way is having a pretty good time away he
4:24:59
sacrificing himself right so that's why uh yeah I mean all of KT can never at
4:25:04
the same time that would not be KT at all yeah okay
4:25:12
oh even gets the does he die yeah uh because yeah smash just chases him down
4:25:17
has the extra movement speed from the Inspire and it is so D like this is this
4:25:23
should be just bar the EV flow of this fight though you
4:25:29
can see now Morgan moving in spots the teleport might see that this is the time magnastorm this time finally working up
4:25:35
the polymorph is gorgeous H Morgan into the back line he stunned forever but he still has access to that Counter Strike
4:25:42
and he's still going to be
4:25:51
fear against in there four people with the ultimate and now HP can you do it
4:25:57
can you be the Savor can you be the her the flash is so [Music]
4:26:05
good another pushing into the river Still Standing what doesn't kly makes stronger D on the Dr oan so points I
4:26:14
said they wouldn't fight over it they're all going all in kosi knocking up everybody but he's super low and kak in
4:26:20
the back line is totally fine but just got here and now it's a 5v5 but everybody on the see the kick is massive
4:26:27
from Canyon but it might not matter D in that backline not able to quite do enough
4:26:34
damage but pan as well still alive full health but he doesn't have a front line anymore the knockup comes in and pan so
4:26:42
sad for him he gets knocked down
4:26:54

4:28:34
I came to the lck to see the best League of Legends there is to offer and then I got to see a perfect season by G I got
4:28:42
to see HW life Esports win the lck season and then I got to see T1 win Worlds but now we get to see Bria up 1 Z
4:28:52
over The Undefeated D+ Kia I am d bro welcome back to the space joining me is
4:28:57
what did and of course chronicler maker as he is uh on the space right here yeah
4:29:04
I don't know why you were so upbeat uh Deon I sold the pantheon and Swain locked in so I I I figured it was a
4:29:10
freebie I went to get popcorn what's on your forehead what's on your forehead sh he carried right did he not one v9
4:29:17
cassan like did no they they lost they lost crony they they lost the game the
4:29:23
Bros bros [Music] won all right uh what do you mean they
4:29:31
got bro they got bro cranny Potter Let's uh how did this happen here the big thing in the draft swing kind of jump on
4:29:38
up okay so and I think it's really easy but with with any team that tries to take big risks some of them are not
4:29:45
going to work out but to me as rough as the Swain looked all the credit here for
4:29:50
Brion because their team fights have just looked impeccable yeah uh
4:29:55
especially from closer and hype was just amazing the way how they start up the
4:30:00
fight was just perfect uh they had insane engages but at the same time you
4:30:06
have to land the skill shots and uh they have to be in a correct positioning and
4:30:11
I think closer and hype both players are just popping off with their Champions
4:30:16
yeah the the Synergy in Brion was at no point missing even after hype killed his
4:30:22
own support didn't matter all for the bit and particularly with DK the
4:30:27
strongest part of this team consistently has been that mid jungle Duo that 2v2
4:30:32
and huk and closer just dunked on them like it was kind of crazy to see lucid
4:30:38
and showmaker I don't think that they've been this outclassed specifically a 2v2 for the entirey C cup so far yeah and I
4:30:45
think it comes from fearlessness even when things don't look so great which is what happens here in highlight number
4:30:50
two at the oton fight uh you lose your jungler early they still pick the fight
4:30:55
because you got a lot of gold on closer to put damage on uh the recipe plus yeah I mean again uh just look at closer how
4:31:03
he positions himself like even though it's 4v5 he still look for the kills Look for the moment that he could jump
4:31:10
in and I think when and actually he lands on uh charm uh on Sante that's the
4:31:18
moment that they could actually win the game here and I think after that it was just clean up uh from hype right there
4:31:25
yeah particularly post buff this is not actually like if this was pre-buff and it's only 100 gold I think denying that
4:31:32
Aon is also big value for DK but instead they don't really get anything a lot of gold still gets funneled into bro and
4:31:38
the denial by itself doesn't mean that much because the composition doesn't really skill that well and Brion as as
4:31:44
as Deon was kind of still scared actually just played a basically perfect G won the early skirmishes had great
4:31:51
objective control and just set up an impeccable game number one it's actually
4:31:56
really cool to see particularly hype his arrows were crazy I mean I think DK
4:32:01
wanted to try something out because this game actually like didn't matter that much for them but I I don't think that
4:32:08
was really good try out for their new pcks like Swain and Port Karma uh and I
4:32:13
think they gave up too much for Bros side they have like V Synergy on the mid jungle uh and also they have Ash and
4:32:21
Elise which is a really high tier in the Bol Lane right now so I feel like they
4:32:26
just need to ban out some good Peaks and then maybe try out some uh some new Peaks here yeah absolutely and and
4:32:32
that's been one of the greatest parts of this D plus Renaissance it has been how much they've cooked in champ select how
4:32:39
unique the champion pool has been this time they get a little uh burnt there in the kitchen they will go back to the
4:32:45
blue side though comfortable here in lck yeah and most likely DK should be winning on blue blue side has been
4:32:51
incredibly strong the only thing that kind of makes you wonder is that I do think that DK both in their losses that
4:32:57
they've had th far individually because they have gone to free games a lot and in their wins have looked a very fast and lose here with had showmaker going
4:33:04
like 0 and four getting murdered by F again and just giggling and throwing his hands up um but bro have also two gen
4:33:12
so I I I don't really know where we go from here normally you know we talk about drop we talk about the fact that
4:33:17
DK as you said on blue side is going to be able to secure a couple of power picks that this time they weren't able to get access to um but is that enough
4:33:25
against the magic of Bon I don't know yeah that's true like
4:33:31
cuz cuz DK I think are right now the best team in the cup that's how I feel that's yeah but does that mean that they
4:33:37
then guaranteed lose well that was my decision making when when it came to predictions uh as
4:33:44
the only oh hey hey he he don't you try to play this you felt guilty yeah just throwing this one out there bro up one Z
4:33:50
will they close it out here against D plus Kia well that man right there Commander closer looking to do so let's
4:33:57
send it back on over to the casters for game number two oh Deon Carris absolutely reeling after his title has
4:34:04
been stolen away by closer and yes bon in great position they could just two Z
4:34:11
DK right here and what the heck he's a chill guy he is he is definitely a chill
4:34:17
guy and also showmaker as well it's actually so good everything about this is
4:34:23
extraordinary um so we do have a little like a few stats like if you want as much League of Legends as possible there
4:34:29
are a few stats that could make you feel a little bit better um D+ have lost a total of zero games on blue side they've
4:34:37
lost uh prior to this game that they just uh did not manage to find a win on uh they had lost three times on red and
4:34:44
were actually on a less than 50% win rate as far as that is concerned so redside has been a problem they will
4:34:50
have to eventually win on red if they win this game they still have to win
4:34:55
this game so can that 100% win rate remain intact well I'll give you another stat what's that D+ have a 0% win rate
4:35:03
in games against bro in the ltk cup true
4:35:08
who that's heavy-hitting stuff I don't know whether I'm ready for the drive AIT
4:35:13
ather okay let's I'm going to do my best as we start off the B phase the aura
4:35:19
taken away from closer makes a whole lot of sense he's played that the most so far and has looked great on it as they
4:35:25
are really making sure closer is not playing um all of his Champions guys who do you think was the problem last game
4:35:31
yeah I um don't say it just spell out in the pands well uh it's currently
4:35:37
ah I think that's how sha fell in the last few PL would agree they're spelling
4:35:43
it perfectly in my recollection oh what's the last one going to be
4:35:49
here as we're waiting like a Cari just ban aelia she was nerfed at this patch
4:35:54
but that was close as one trick coming into the lck HX leas in that's a worthy one yeah uh and then presumably CL yep
4:36:02
and now D+ so they've spelled sack and you've got ow on the side of D+ did that
4:36:09
spell it out uh for you yeah thank you you're welcome um NY going to be locked in first here for Lucid uh he's a pretty
4:36:16
good NY player but I think this like being face up does give bro a bunch of information see what they're going to
4:36:23
put together and I like what the what the space was talking about when it comes to they they're happy with D+
4:36:30
cooking some of the problems are like if you if you really get it wrong right if you really burn it then it can explode
4:36:36
in the oven and that can cause damage to the oven we'll just have to see how the oven is as double yordles picked up here
4:36:43
y combo one of these yles I feel differently about differently than the
4:36:48
other one I I feel like there it's a a true dichotomy here as far as how Orcs
4:36:54
is feeling about these two yles yeah um I will also say that you know playing zigs into nidle has a decent amount of
4:37:00
sustain um can make your poke a fair bit less effective K is going to come out as well a decent amount of poke from D plus
4:37:08
2 between those two Champions I'm feeling it could be a y angle but it's not going to happen as the poppy is
4:37:14
locked in is extremely face up could also be a poppy heading towards a top
4:37:21
side of the map I guess but that is a Malai the immediate response to this poppy kind of gorgeous I love this
4:37:27
because Twisted advance of course ignores the steadfast presence you can really get the the Malai in there yeah
4:37:33
and the thing is that a lot of support Champions or just engage Champions are shut down by poppy but as you said Malai
4:37:39
really want that isn't but also like you're fing taer and you're playing nly Champions that once set up one engage
4:37:45
you only engage so far as a poppy who's not that good at sort of locking people
4:37:50
down I like if they're against a wall that is the main condition you need which is in a lot of situations they won't be against the wall especially
4:37:56
when there's a poppy in the team n it's going to be Top Lane n they're going to lock jarin and Nivea so that they can do
4:38:04
double walls and they can be walls everywhere Barrel can stun them all over the place doesn't matter I could believe
4:38:09
it um trundle you know there's a lot of construction that can go on on Summoners
4:38:14
Rift I like the lot seen a with a bunch but mostly just CU it provides an extra way of like engaging the setup denying
4:38:21
that one I think pretty important we own a ban coming out um from the side of deus here want to limit those engage
4:38:28
options if you force Bon into a situation where uh pick that doesn't do
4:38:34
well into poppy you would really want to play well set yeah that one away from
4:38:39
showmaker presumably that's one that uh Sher has played so far um he's played you know all sorts of
4:38:47
things like he's played zillian and Zoe before as well um but the set certainly was a victory did look pretty good so
4:38:55
limiting his physical options in the mid lane which is sort of aim of the game right now as the ja to be taken away
4:39:02
from Morgan his Renekton is available you know honestly I feel like
4:39:07
the comp could maybe work for the feel pause to go into the ra I mean it's not
4:39:13
unplayable into the poppy you can like que and then Dash in but I don't like
4:39:18
yeah picking the Renekton it's also a pick away from showmaker cuz they want to have Synergy with the N they need a
4:39:24
physical option for Mid there's not that many as gang plank being
4:39:30
considered likely the shio option does give them some scaling and also adds to their engage right you put the cannon
4:39:36
barrage down as you're not going to be picking that that's a trendir that's a lock in trinia mid into the cor key this
4:39:43
is certainly a match up back when uh trinia was first on played mid lane this
4:39:49
is sort a match up with gon just being able to get an advantage and dive I'm also pretty sure showmaker has played
4:39:55
this in the past I don't know how recently um I'm going to check it out
4:40:01
now I'm going to be completely honest this is the sort of composition you end up with in Solo que um from De plus K
4:40:07
yeah uh okay guess the win rate and guess how many many times he's died oh
4:40:14
um I mean his Al stops him from dying yeah how many games has he played it I'm
4:40:20
not going to tell you that okay let's say has he played it four times uh well
4:40:25
I I said I'm not going to tell you that oh you have to guess percentage and win rate win rate 37 uh-huh deaths nine win
4:40:35
rate 100% death zero oh okay I guess I didn't believe apologies showmaker
4:40:41
um I won't tell you the sample size it's it's one game oh okay well there you go
4:40:46
one good game yeah I mean I feel like the aliser value here is massive aliser
4:40:51
can struggle in a poppy but also just good at disengaging things like the triner um I feel like it's a pretty
4:40:57
straightforward front to back for bro lot of tools to engage a lot of poke lot late game Power and D+ are just like
4:41:05
let's just win Lane you know let's just win lane and then we'll win LAN and yeah
4:41:12
yeah and then maybe we'll see what happens as the game goes later but we'll think about that when we get there and
4:41:18
they're all about Crossing Bridges when they you cannot cross a bridge if you're not at the bridge exactly it's future de
4:41:24
problem exactly and we all know that that they're procrastinators these are pro Gamers and procrastinators at the
4:41:31
same time but that's a Trin mid he's already brought out the zillian the set the Zoey uh he's just a trend setter
4:41:39
this showmaker guy in the mid lane and we'll see how he's going to do can he once again hit that 100% win rate on
4:41:46
that Trend and bring us to a game three we'll have to find out as we jump into the
4:41:56
[Applause]
4:42:04
game all right bro fans you know what to do in the chat if we do not get enough
4:42:09
extra bro tax we may be able to fund this next Victory so highlight those
4:42:15
chats and get them in there y if you want bro to win very important but maybe
4:42:20
you just want more games and honestly that feels like the gigachad attitude and so maybe uh just say brox or say
4:42:27
like DK tax if you just want more games w w maybe that is that crazy is that like not a bro thing to do because I
4:42:33
feel like Bros like the gig Chads are just givers you know they just want to give more to the world you pay the Bro
4:42:39
tax bro decides what happens bro wants more games that's within their rights but yeah right so bro has all of the
4:42:46
decision-making power yes and the Bros may just give us a third game yes they just they decide to be generous okay
4:42:53
although I think right now their draft is looking really good Orcs yeah it is looking very good um I would say uh you
4:43:01
know we normally talk about nidy being a champion also kaisa being a champion where you want set up you want someone
4:43:06
to lead the charge to to provide that CC um if they're standing against to wall
4:43:11
and see is in mega they they have set up yep
4:43:17
otherwise nothing yeah it's rough these are two very very strict conditions we
4:43:24
have to remember as well sh is a great n player in general um was certainly dominating on that one in the uh in
4:43:31
Challenger as you know as we know almost all top laners it's like junglers and saying oh he was a Le H player it's sort
4:43:37
of like saying he's a jungler same really can be said for top has found a lot of success on this Champion as well
4:43:43
Morgan is the reekon guy though y we'll see how he goes right now aiming in
4:43:49
barrel with a lot of control of this bottom Lane and it feels like so much comfort like showmaker is on a crazy
4:43:54
pick Barrel is on a champion that can completely warp games it's aiming Kaiser one of his best champions of all time uh
4:44:01
so and Lucid on a carry in the jungle yeah I'm surprised CLA didn't go like a defensive Summoner cuz one of the adaptations we saw when it was like Trin
4:44:08
vs corki is corki would also go defensive some like exhaust to kind of limit the cuz at level six sometimes you
4:44:16
can just get do by the triny and there's not much you can do and exhaust can really save you there so didn't end up
4:44:22
going for that um obviously ear levels you're kind of okay until he spins on you yeah and spear not going to connect
4:44:28
but uh gets the valkyrie out bunch of Mana man if only someone had some CC just like a a Crum of CC well we'll just
4:44:36
have to see whether Lucid can do his best canyon impression because he's not going to get help from his Lane so he
4:44:41
has to just abuse the enemy jungler and of course maai not the fastest and not the most battle ready earlier on and so
4:44:49
definite possibility and I don't know what you're talking about the setup is there from showmaker if they have their back to him
4:44:55
he can make them go a bit slower okay I will have you know and there'll also be an adorable chicken above their head
4:45:01
yeah that's all you need right yeah yeah well I mean maybe it's not all you need
4:45:06
but it helps we're getting even more conditions n needs to be Mega they need to be against a wall and they need to
4:45:11
have the back tin yeah there we go and the comp has Cc or Lucid Just Hits it you know maybe
4:45:21
that happens it could happen yeah not likely well there's a wall as hype is in
4:45:27
a little bit of trouble here hok was coming over for a potential dive aiming is low yeah hype resisted the urge to
4:45:33
just immediately Satchel away and get to I wouldn't be speaking from
4:45:39
experience no never happened to to a player like Daniel Orcs Harrison as showmaker used
4:45:46
that spinning strike the wrong direction and is now possibly going never mind he's just not going to do anything
4:45:52
presses powerful walking yeah that is some war never would have thought that that would be the true counter to that
4:45:58
uh that little gank attempt but huk the lumbering tree the ants are not known for their speed as Barrel's not known
4:46:04
for his decision making as he is now going to also do the same thing he's flashing Po's flashing um he
4:46:12
traded Barrel's one oneing um the buckler Shield does absolutely nothing
4:46:17
hype's going to move on over the ignite goes down void seeker comes through Barrel's
4:46:22
dead you wouldn't get it and Barrel's dead you wouldn't get it you would you wouldn't get it okay
4:46:29
can you decipher it me this guy's a two- time world champion okay you just you wouldn't get it okay no it's my bad you
4:46:35
have to trust in the process okay he just he gave aiming a free Lane am I
4:46:40
right he [Laughter] even I want a slow motion replay cuz we
4:46:49
need to get to the bottom of it God I wish we had it we need the voice coms I need know what he said before he said
4:46:56
aiming to watch this all right here's the replay here's
4:47:03
a replay okay break it down for me Ox really on the same page you can see
4:47:09
Barrel goes in and a channels his back yeah um well he's just trying to he's like
4:47:15
you need to push the wave here's how we're going to let you push the wave uhhuh he unlocked hex
4:47:23
spash sorted I guess yeah um it was a Tempo
4:47:28
play I think I I think I get it as much as you do now um it was a Tempo play okay he's
4:47:35
just he's playing he's playing to get his ad carry a faster reset so they can play for grubs got it
4:47:41
um well there is some Vision Barrel throwing bucklers spear narrowly missing
4:47:47
there as the hextech Minefield is going to try and block the entrance Barrel going to get flashed on by Morgan hea
4:47:53
pulverized and Barrel's in the blender and will be taken down can they get more is the question though is Shu really
4:47:59
good Nar Morgan in trouble they're diving in Shu actually not activating the mega nard just yet as the wallup
4:48:05
connects onto hambach they do manage to get one of these grubs the showmaker is
4:48:10
going istic the ultimates available and now hype in the back of this pit really
4:48:15
going to trouble struggle but he does have that Satchel in place and undying rage comes down triple for the trendir
4:48:23
this is what Barrel was looking for I guess uh in that play earlier on as
4:48:29
aiming wants to kill closer closer wants his plane to drive faster as barrel uh
4:48:35
doesn't get the heroic charge but he does get the buckler cuz that one's targeted aiming not interest in what
4:48:41
Barrel's doing once again and I don't blame him I got it okay so Barrel wanted to create space for his team right so he
4:48:48
burn his flash but he needs him to know his flash is down got it so because his flash is down Morgan engages on him they
4:48:53
use every bit of CC on him as he's flashless and that frees up showmaker to
4:48:59
take over the fight see this is the thing this is the thing you're going to think it's crazy if you're not on the
4:49:04
same level I uh I I understand as sh finds a great angle here and this is
4:49:09
where trend thrives like could you imagine a better trir angle than
4:49:15
everyone's incredibly low and you haven't pressed R yet yes I will also say in terms of the amount of CC you
4:49:21
need to use on a level four poppy all of it it's not about that probably not you
4:49:28
know cuz they use the stun from Morgan the combo from po then they use the
4:49:34
you're detracting from the magic yeah but it's just it's Mind Games you know
4:49:39
and it's success it's it it works it works well now we've got a killing spree trir situation yeah that's a problem um
4:49:47
not sure who's going to deal with him in the S Side Lane well we'll uh we'll have to find out a little bit later we're all about bridges that are actually
4:49:52
approached um being the things that we're focusing on as po taking a bit of damage here hok clearing out a control
4:49:58
Ward as he also gets a free trip towards his turret and dances away from the
4:50:03
brambles hok's like wait don't go away I want to kill you and he says no I prefer that not to happen I hate those sort of
4:50:08
gangs that junglers do where they know they're not kill you you know they're not going to kill you but they just come in and chunk you out and be annoying n
4:50:16
is so when n comes in lane and just AOS you a few times the red buff grinds my gears yeah well it's uh it's currently
4:50:22
grinding closes gears and he has those cuz he has a plane there are gears uh
4:50:28
yeah uh that's ground is Cannon some ground gears um someone who doesn't have
4:50:34
ground gears is Barrel who's chilling out here towards the top side of the map um see whether he goes in aggressively
4:50:40
once more sha just eats his q and is going to be able to grab himself a plate
4:50:46
yeah Clos is at least able to clear the W pretty quickly for now um and mitigate pressure coming out this is a wacky
4:50:53
series I don't know what's like imagine if we get to game three um and what's going to happen there how do they top
4:51:00
this I'm not ready for it yet that's for future user work out similar to how oh yeah the bridg is thing yeah yeah it all
4:51:06
comes around doesn't it well she trying to avoid these bouncing bombs y little switch up to
4:51:14
have the the N poppy du lane and then just like aiming solo Farm more yles as
4:51:20
hype is going to take a bit of damage here that pulverized was weird not sure what that was about but the Satchel is
4:51:25
gorgeous is going to disengage defens of satchel a lot of value uh yeah so some
4:51:32
interesting Lane assignment try to get some solo XP for aiming but he's still kind of about even to Hype hype G the hex te alternator first huh not
4:51:39
something we commonly see it's a shadow flame Rush Oh my God Dash Cannon
4:51:46
zigs could you imagine battle zigs well here's the thing right you know I got we
4:51:52
saw aiming go Blackfire torch zigs and I incorrectly called it death fire grasp
4:51:57
they look similar wao death fire grasp would be sick you'd always be in range for that as Z exactly and if if you were
4:52:02
playing death fire grasp it would probably the mod ER it build at a hex te alternator you got to that's true but you also should have a dash Cannon if
4:52:08
you're going to use the um the yeah the death fire grass a distance with a
4:52:14
rocket belt death grass them Satchel them into and death fire grass them before the Rockets land so you can maximize the damage from the amp of the
4:52:20
death fire grasp oh God that would be gorgeous let's focus on this fight potentially down towards the bottom side as Barrel probably going to be denied
4:52:27
this little engage moment this is awkward though because now the tree is smashed into a wall the double knock up
4:52:32
from the ulti here short Channel just to keep them in place is aiming Killer Instinct and it's going to be the
4:52:38
buckler wielder that takes them down and now Polo trying to play defense will be out to pull three and get away but that
4:52:44
is still the pick successful for DK as Lucid getting a bit of his own medicine here as hype makes his life a bit
4:52:51
frustrating and it's showmaker versus Morgan here towards the top side wow that is an old match up Renekton versus
4:52:57
trendir this reminds me of solo Q in 2013 yeah yeah big throwback you know uh
4:53:04
has been a while since we've seen that sort of thing but uh not been a while since we've seen a little bit of over aggression coming out from bro there
4:53:11
trying to make the play happen counter gangs there from D+ aiming there to clean up uh you can tell very quickly
4:53:17
they realize this is a bad idea the ult from hak's lot to kind of save the play
4:53:22
but unfortunately he's not able to get out doesn't have Flash and one of the big things here is
4:53:28
that aiming doesn't get the kill I actually think that if aiming gets a lot of kills in this early game he will be
4:53:33
really really scary to deal with but it's Barrel kill it's Barrel's kill so we understand that that is he's trying
4:53:39
to fix his KDA a little a little bit Yeah well he does you know Barrel just wants to be involved he wants to be all
4:53:45
the kills all the deaths and right now he is half of the deaths and a quarter of the kills so honestly not a great
4:53:52
effort thus far hey there's five people right for support he's doing a hey true true best
4:53:57
yeah uh but I think uh showmaker is the one with a big Target on his back right
4:54:02
now not actually ahead by that much um even though he does have a killing spre worth of kills closer is 101 also has a
4:54:08
lot of farm sh trying to at Bay right now um but we'll see whether closer can
4:54:14
be one of the players that manages to escape the the Cory curse we have seen a few people do it um and more recently
4:54:21
than not uh he has been finding some wins but it's uh it was it was a tough
4:54:27
Champion to make work in the early phase of the lck cup yeah hyp got his lud
4:54:33
completed good amount of poke he'd go the tier for the extra Mana early as well kind of why he can afford to go hex
4:54:39
gold before lost chap oh could be he's okay I mean barel Barrel yeah yeah these
4:54:44
are some decent spikes though Triforce coming through L is coming through um lot of one it spikes across the board
4:54:51
setting up around dragon is a mountain I think we had this last game where it was infernal mountain and then chem Tech um
4:54:57
so like are you saying that it might happen again again well it could be
4:55:03
first tur blood going over to Morgan as well as we manag to get a feet of strength it happens again oh gorgeous
4:55:10
thing is not consistent I know it's beautiful and closing out taking a bit of damage here as we do have the stri
4:55:15
breaker done for showmaker able to get in there uh spin around an extra time sh going to look to try and defend this
4:55:22
keep those Feats of Strength competitive and you know once again D plus can have a composition that's that's decent with
4:55:29
CCH you have the healing from Lucid oh o there's the wallup the N pushes him back as oh no doesn't hit the wall and hype's
4:55:35
able to flash still keep his verdict going to get them out of there and Barrel not taking as much as bro would have liked from that Mega
4:55:43
Inferno bomb now that's on cool down now huk is very low DK could get something done up here showmaker is just pushing
4:55:50
this is um yeah this is what Trin does guys he uh sits in s Side Lane and he he
4:55:55
go hit turret that's his job and uh bro going to have to figure out ways to match him I think to be fair Morgan is
4:56:01
strong enough that he shouldn't just be able to dive him anytime soon so just has to be there and wave clear which
4:56:06
obviously means he's not there for the fight but I think he can live that also she'll make a notp so you don't have to worry too much about that and that
4:56:13
really is one of the limiting factors for uh D+ is when you get to team fights
4:56:18
late game is showmaker going to be there well I'm wagering a probably not on that
4:56:26
one yeah um and I also don't know whether that's the worst decision for D+ to make as well just have to see whether
4:56:32
they have enough wave clear to uh keep their turrets alive if that does indeed happen I mean they have a zig one of the
4:56:38
things with zigs as well when you have like a a split Pusher you just ult a wave yeah and you have so much wave clear that like yes showmaker is going
4:56:45
to be a threatened s Side Lane but zigs is one of the best champions of just eliminating that threat and Cha should
4:56:52
probably be just you know zombie pushing um as this game continues currently level 11 as well so a bit more duration
4:56:59
on that undying rage is going to be pretty important if he does ever actually you know contribute to a team
4:57:05
fight um doesn't have teleport which helps with the uh the whole I'm not going to be there um scenario at least
4:57:13
he's honest about it yeah and Morgan's just kind of fighting the wave and not him yeah and
4:57:20
the wave doesn't do too much to showmaker either so he is extending his gold lead um that he does have by trying
4:57:25
to catch up to close here but what a chaotic early game it has kind of slowed down a fair bit yeah both teams like weighing each other up um I think bro
4:57:33
pretty happy with just leading into the late game with this one yep and I think it's a little bit like the chem Tech
4:57:39
hangover you know like the the Dragon Goes Down everyone's amped up they're like ready to hex tech people the
4:57:44
flower's right there oh no why wouldn't you take it that's be your whole team
4:57:49
seen a lot of this places to be I guess well we're looking to kill a turret CL are notoriously not a romantic guy he
4:57:56
doesn't care about the flowers yeah and this is going to be uh F strength as well for bro as they do just overload
4:58:01
the bottom side of the map they are going to be able to take this one down and so that is some upgraded shoes that they put together for themselves as
4:58:07
closer is oh yeah he's dead um thrown into the wall and mashed into a pulp
4:58:14
that is going to be the kill they decide that they will let the Lord live for now and meanwhile Clos is dead uh two
4:58:21
conditions mear an extra wall and and deos are making making those conditions
4:58:26
work yeah they really are they're finding the angles you know they got hype spash with it now they get closer with it I think closer had to flash out
4:58:33
from the poppy there uh but held it was thinking he could wait it out yeah so was there an extra kill that happened at
4:58:39
some point on the map or did I just lose my mind for a moment uh hok's going to come on over and stop showmaker from
4:58:45
taking this and he's going to get the good old Teo thumbs up showmaker does like to put down uh and the answer to my question
4:58:52
was no um I'm just insane as slice and dice going to be declined there as why
4:58:58
was Barrel there why I think you can just say why was Barrel true very true but that was just
4:59:06
it was it was comical in uh in the timing house going to come on through there to clear out the rest of the wave as theity for goes yeah so Clos was dead
4:59:15
because he was the one that just died and I commentated it so um my brain is suffering just a little yeah he needed a
4:59:20
flash there I think is is my if he wanted to be in his nice yep nice nice he's like if you
4:59:30
kill him it's a free win that's what he said and show yeah he's like top Demolition and
4:59:38
GG uh showmaker is having a really good day by the looks of things heing he's
4:59:43
really really having a good time just got like beaten up on Swain and then it's just like yeah time to play trir
4:59:50
I'm having a good time go back and just build quick blades oh man wait I think CL yeah had to flash that's the replay
4:59:57
but it's so scary now when you're playing into the theori quick blade trir he doesn't have an e cool down he spins
5:00:03
a lot yeah he's Beyblade trir man imagine if AP trir was still a
5:00:10
and quick blades was in the game disgusting yeah voy boy would have had he would have been the best top laner in
5:00:15
the universe me as if he wasn't already yeah I was about to say I'm sorry he's the
5:00:21
kid uh we know that um bro going to be starting off this Dragon this Dragon means about zero uh as showmaker is in
5:00:28
the M mid lane uh letting them know that they care about zero about it as Mega
5:00:34
Inferno bomb comes down that's not going to kill this one as Barrel charges the ulti doesn't actually throw it through
5:00:40
and big ones are starting to rain down sh does have mega prepared as now the ulti comes down but Barrel he's going to
5:00:48
walk aiming walk a lot of walk being a good strategy here as Morgan trying to
5:00:54
be that front line showmaker able to just slash his way out spinning Le and DK will disengage yeah bro heavily
5:01:01
commit to the chem Tech dragon and then just give up two mid towers for it which is such a poor play especially
5:01:06
considering the composition you're playing into has a about a kaisa's length of range and basically that's it
5:01:13
so like sieging for this de team is actually really hard and they can get Towers in the S Side Lane easily with the 131 or just the 41 but getting mid
5:01:21
Tower is such a battle into zig's Corky yeah I feel like was actually something that would really prevent de from from
5:01:27
pushing the pace of the game forwards but bro would just kind of give him a double not even a freeb a double freeb
5:01:34
man I'm do you know what I'm sad about what I'm sad about now is that we can't have showmaker playing in game three
5:01:42
because he's just having such a good time yeah and doesn't it make you happy when show is happy I know it sounds bias
5:01:48
but showmaker is such an Entertainer yeah and he really needs to be feeling it to do his best work so we as LK fans
5:01:56
are just blessed if uh shower is having a good day yep it's true CL are going to
5:02:01
complete the two item Spike though on the Cory but it's really feeling like an early week's Corky uh situation here in
5:02:08
this game despite the the fact that he has been farming quite well it's kind of just been like farming and not really
5:02:14
achieving very much but fair not much has happened for a while with bro yeah
5:02:19
and the Gap is completely closed right was about 20 CS behind people being slacking on the Bro tax that's for sure
5:02:25
I think that might be it I haven't like I'm looking at the chat right now and there is no purple wow I see nothing wow
5:02:33
um there's someone talking about odd one's Noo-noo which honestly bed I feel like some people think it's like you
5:02:39
know know taxes in real life where you pay it once a year and then you done that's not how it works guys no that's not hows not with bro not with bro not
5:02:46
with the okay saving spank bro is like when there's like a dictator a tyan it's like no more taxes more taxes more taxes
5:02:52
they're they're levying as all right it's another wall up and pulls back closer oh god oh it's just lunch in a
5:02:59
plane as aiming is going to be able to supercharge his way out of that and you can't even kill the wave there's one
5:03:05
melee minion just enough they're able to take it down just Mega engaging is all you need that's just the strategy uh
5:03:12
every single kill basically that defos have had has been set up by bro apart from that team fight sorry set up by C
5:03:19
apart from that team fight where show maker got three she amount of like e forward transform and just wall up them
5:03:26
you think they every time he does that and it works but uh yeah it's just it's just panning out it's working oh big
5:03:31
spear yeah uh they can't kill showmaker I know that and huk has got to work on
5:03:40
this Aon oh it's the just start Aon time of the game oh
5:03:47
yeah not that's the strategy guys make triny a team fight uh-huh well I mean
5:03:52
they are in the lane that showmaker is in um so that will help show maker team fight as sh is going to teleport in he
5:03:58
has mean for another half a second as keep's verdict says goodbye cow and HBU in so much trouble uh sh is getting cced
5:04:06
a little bit he's got undying rage but now he can even just reset and go home if he'd like to Lucid is pouncing
5:04:13
forward over the wall there as well I think that might be a little bit never mind it's not over aggressive because he can just withdraw goes back home Barrel
5:04:20
is dancing forward gets himself a beautiful steadfast presence to lock them in place and now closer um I mean
5:04:27
he'll kill Barrel but Barrel will set up the Killer Instinct for aiming and there is the Ace for D+ oh the third game it
5:04:36
is looking absolutely gorgeous D Plus just they they just leave the attan
5:04:41
there and bro can't resist starting it up they feel locked in they've lost too many turrets they're scared of the 131
5:04:47
the one the 41 they're like we have to we just have to attan and they fall right into Barrel's trap he set when he
5:04:53
died in lane at the start of the game he saw this all coming yeah he did he knew it was in the te leaves or something
5:05:00
shiu just jumps in alss and then here uh the Al and Barrel pretty good moving the
5:05:05
alas to all support his handb back Flash and then they kind of just slowly approach them again this team is lacking
5:05:11
CC and they don't have the mega so they really just but what do they do if showmaker is just hacking them apart
5:05:19
well I mean that's the thing they just walk at them and then just just attack them yeah it's that simple it's they're
5:05:25
using the death CC very very well yes very insightful you know I don't think
5:05:31
barl realize he have the buff this is just him he would have done it without the buff 100% 100% um it's only
5:05:38
encouragement uh for Barrel as all right aiming going to be starting off this uh
5:05:44
chem Tech dragon and will'll be able to take that one down with lucid's help there is nothing that bro can do about
5:05:49
that you can see it's looking like a bike jump as far as this gold graph is concerned I me a pretty lethal bike oh
5:05:56
yeah no you are it's it's almost a quarterpipe um you would be coming back down the other way however serious speed
5:06:02
to get up nothing true it's maybe a motorbike jump okay that's that's fair yeah as there's a
5:06:10
really cool new game where you're a motorbike uh with a gun um it's coming out on switch soon I'm really excited about it but that's a bit of an aside
5:06:17
you are the mik I think it's both I'm not entirely I didn't watch all of the trailer but I'm still excited about it uh aiming is just killing hum um the
5:06:24
turret might keep him alive for now as the unbreakable will is a lie it's looking a bit breakable until
5:06:30
we get into game two of course gig Chads don't you worry yeah um sorry into the game three this whole series is just
5:06:38
mindblowing but it's been my favorite like I'm I feel so blessed you know I've got to cast geni versus bro and DK
5:06:46
versus bro it's been a ride it's been the best ride yeah I mean bro just up in
5:06:52
the ATI right take it to the game three I don't think it's interesting if they if they play a game with they're already
5:06:58
10 ahead they have to take it down to one each they're Fair they're generous
5:07:03
oh look at this Morgan going back to base he's going to buy some new shoes and they're pretty well upgraded
5:07:10
just don't know whether these uh the Feats of Strength or the yeah the feet of strength that Morgan now has is going
5:07:16
to be enough to stop this because look showmaker like just there is nothing
5:07:22
stopping him apart from his jungler from just taking anything that he wants Lucid just speared red buff and stole it yeah
5:07:29
from from showmaker I think he just wanted to he's a jungle you know like
5:07:34
it's it's hard wi I mean I'm pretty sure I I he some warning things on I really hope showmaker is that guy in chat like
5:07:40
in the game that's like no no no don't help me no no no don't I need to see if I can solo it I can solo it I can solo
5:07:46
it guys no no go away no go away I'm solo it no guys all right well that is
5:07:53
keep his verdict that's going to get rid of hok that is going to make sure that this Baron is not long for the world now Barrel is keeping them busy showmaker is
5:08:00
spotted by a sapling and now just flashes in to everything undying rage is
5:08:07
going to be used here he will have the que but he's still dead closer able to survive this one as well as Shu wanting
5:08:13
to hop around this Minefield oh no the Grump The Flash Forward and there's a take down from Lucid to get some Revenge
5:08:20
aiming with the Killer Instinct will take down the lord it's a double kill there shu is done with this game it is
5:08:25
way too silly and Monty Python they told us all about things being too silly sh knows exactly how that feels as he looks
5:08:33
to take down hype on the fountain while the rest of his team finally gets their
5:08:38
act together and sends us to a game three there is no series that I want three games in more than this one and
5:08:45
the Giga Chads will give it to us with DK there as well helping out with their
5:08:52
pretty textbook win with their trender Mir mid this Chef here making his way
5:08:58
out on out of the stage what a genius yeah face call little bit rough you know little over done it didn't blow up the
5:09:04
oven though is what we what we learned second course a lot better um yeah I mean I kind of knew it was over as soon
5:09:10
as barl did that thing where he went in level three and just died I I knew it was over then he just it's just Aura
5:09:17
right you can't compete with that you can't understand it they don't good luck gogar is what I'm saying who's like trying to figure out what the best
5:09:24
feedback is they don't need CC they just need Vibes [Laughter]
5:09:29
that's the CC was what like barrels moves were that game that was
5:09:36
the CC they just confused them right yeah yeah pushes like Barrel gets to
5:09:43
manipulate them into the positions that he wants them in um hype did a lot of damage M much as ziggs is want to do but
5:09:50
uh she's n absolutely fantastic he did he he was Mega and they were against a wall several times several times that's
5:09:57
that's the condition it's a very strange strange
5:10:02
game I feel like this wasn't the best one to be an analyst but it was
5:10:07
definitely the best game to be a viewer it's making me question everything yeah and thankfully if we're here we're also
5:10:14
viewing so it's a benefit to us too time for us to go to a short break when we get back to space is going to figure that game out good luck and uh then
5:10:20
we're going to have game number three oh baby

5:17:03
the D+ chefs went straight back to the kitchen and cooked up yet another one where like Swain n uhuh I'm going to
5:17:10
make you pick Corky but more importantly we're going to pick Tren deir for showmaker welcome back to the space I
5:17:16
think I'm still D bro I think I'm still D bro I am Dr bro yes D bro here
5:17:21
alongside W did and Chronicle maker he's uh feeling good after that one better
5:17:28
yeah my my this my if you can't read it this is shu is is autograph uh that's on
5:17:34
my head uh I've been told permanently I hope that's not true uh and a they had a much better game this time around I uh
5:17:42
I'm actually I think that this series both from the costers and just from the viewers perspective is just giving Peak
5:17:50
I don't know what exactly I don't know if it's League of Legends even necessarily but it is I know what we're
5:17:55
witnessing is great I mean at this point you know I'm not sure if DK is actually
5:18:00
uh playing for fun or yeah they are it's the way that they playing serious you know take it serious they need to like
5:18:08
have some fun so like how does that work for DK how can you know what your
5:18:13
opponent is doing if your opponent doesn't know what they are doing that's true that's true I think it's very very
5:18:18
tough to predict uh the guys on the cast did their best to predict what Barrell did which led to this fight it's our
5:18:25
first highlight here at the grubs remember no flash on Barrel I mean basically they have tons of CCS but they
5:18:32
used everything on poppy so that's why trir was so free to hit every Target in the CC so I mean this was the team fight
5:18:41
that when you have no CC on trendir this is what happens basically yeah and Swain
5:18:47
and trir are very similar in many ways they feel uncapable if they fall behind they don't do anything trir at least has
5:18:55
the possibility to scale eventually once he gets his items but when they get ahead uh they do become a bit of a
5:19:01
nuisance and that Swain game was really stressful he did Kill like that that
5:19:07
Swain game that really hurt I think that was was showmaker was you know he was trying to put him a big F he was trying
5:19:12
to have a good time so he earned a little vacation right he deserves it he
5:19:18
deserves some time off without TP by the way oh TP it's fine it's fine as soon as
5:19:24
someone joins my Lane I can leave I can leave I don't need to be here I also have a ghost as well to speed up oh it's
5:19:32
so nice I have free kills no one can match me who cares walk walk who cares
5:19:37
about the rotation it's another a tur gun who cares what the team fight man that Swain seems like a distant memory I
5:19:44
mean they actually deserves it because they already got the four wins and they're they already locked in for the
5:19:50
playoffs as well so why not vacation this is just what you dream of
5:19:56
when you're a trendir player you know just having a good time and guess what it's not just turrets it's objectives as
5:20:03
well go walk ah a Dre doesn't it just fill you
5:20:10
with joy yes it's a dream and popcorns as well paid by Riot
5:20:18
free popcorn thanks to Jon thank G well uh definitely as we got to see
5:20:25
inside the mind and thought process of world championship winning junglers we
5:20:30
here at the lck like to present you some Cinema as well which is why we popped out the popcorn uh again barl doing
5:20:39
things that action Stars wish that they could do as well yeah it's actually not
5:20:44
very commonly known but barl does all his own stunts uh there's no stuntman involved this is all him this is all
5:20:51
two-time world champion one of the most successful supports in the world made it to fre World Finals in a row
5:20:59
yeah I mean what did he mean by this
5:21:10
this is so good actually water at it water at it the
5:21:16
best part is we have a game free and I don't know what's going to happen I don't know either uh it feels like the
5:21:22
thing that when I think about closer throughout this lck cup he's been very very impressive except on the Corky I
5:21:28
don't know why they picked it uh is the Aurora and that is the one thing the one ingredient that D+ has not allowed the
5:21:35
Bros to cook with I'm hoping that maybe they do let them cook with that one uh but I'm not sure if you got to pick any
5:21:42
Champion here with did that gets thrown into a draft that'll be fun to build around who you thinking about here I
5:21:48
mean there's a meme about showmaker and cnra is that cnra is his ex-girlfriend
5:21:54
you know cuz he actually left Syra for a
5:21:59
long time right and cnra kind of popped off with bdd yeah and it and it's his
5:22:05
favorite Champion so maybe it's time to get back with that relationship I would
5:22:11
love it you can't let bdd out Chine you you already took the Zoe give us the cnra I mean uh Beni and pumu over on the
5:22:20
side of D+ have unleashed the champion pools for this squad on the opposite
5:22:26
side the Bros looking to go two and three and defeat their Rivals as they
5:22:32
did in the kespa cup one more time here in the lck cup will they be able to do it let's find out as we send it back
5:22:38
back on over to the casters for the final game Atlas and dox I I really enjoyed the six shears that were there
5:22:45
on that sign I did not enjoy the relationship advice of get back with your ex's that is not
5:22:52
the advice any good friend would give just give yeah get back with your ex though dude you was so happy right we're
5:22:58
friends with those guys yeah oh man okay I mean thankfully we're happy in our
5:23:04
relationships ORS yeah um because if we weren't the advice be getting would be
5:23:11
not good maybe this is why right all the LZ crew are in long-term relationships right they haven't had to give out good
5:23:17
advice yeah so they're out of practice when it comes to to good advice and uh that certainly could be true here we are
5:23:23
into game three ladies and gentlemen OK Savings Bank Brion are now on the blue side with a slight Advantage there they
5:23:29
do uh manag to ban away a bunch of things coordinate this first pick like
5:23:35
they would want to one free ban here for D plus after this final ban comes in for
5:23:41
ok Savings Bank pron and Sh going to get a lot of the focus out of these first couple of ANS Morgan wanting to hard
5:23:47
carry this one is the Lilia going to be removed yeah I think especially I feel
5:23:53
like jungle as a pool that started to get really pinched later in the draft in Fearless just feels like the pool of as
5:23:59
J as you want to play but to be fair I feel like the jungers you see this game like P Pantheon which is often ban
5:24:06
there's still options available um um yeah the raon band coming out bit of an interesting one definitely something po
5:24:12
does like to play the Aurora is up yeah I think you just take it first pick I would agree uh especially because you
5:24:19
can Flex it in theory and best are also up this is Lord Morgan's favorite
5:24:24
champion at the moment man if they got best at Aurora it'd be insane so I'm assuming D Plus have the plans to take
5:24:29
away the Aurora from him I think Aurelia is probably the choice especially now that she's fresh off the Nerf bat um
5:24:36
certainly a good idea Sani just being missing today she has hasn't shown up once so Sani Camille uh-huh um I don't
5:24:45
know whether that's one that's going to get picked away from you uh because there are lots of okay's
5:24:51
just locked in we saw Z on it yesterday um sorry uh yeah Z on it yesterday I get
5:24:56
confused because I still associate Z with T1 and they played earlier today but it was yesterday on hle that he did
5:25:01
play it uh Lucid what are we going to be picking I think Aurora probably should happen then you can provide pens for
5:25:07
people you know like you can really put them in a uh comfortably not an actual
5:25:13
Bo thresh was played in our previous series hasn't picked up here yet that's is real I'm
5:25:19
not uh not I mean it's a good pick for aiming not super jazzed on the pick in general I feel like it's not been yeah
5:25:26
kind of a little bit rough recently uh but you know I feel like the Aurora is still there they go for the ra they
5:25:31
really want to secure a pick Apollo early on MF is one I I probably feel even worse about than Ezreal yeah how
5:25:38
it's been going that was like a hold my beer situation because I like I saw the Camille Ezreal and I was like wow I'm
5:25:45
underwhelmed um but then the real MF came in and so my level of welmed has
5:25:50
gone even further down and now it's a Braum and we're not questioning Barrel so my wedness is not going to
5:25:58
move so lock in his job is to stand there and block their uh no it's
5:26:04
not don't Define Barrel how dare yeah that's the thing is you can W flash
5:26:11
r on bra true it's just like raan and if you Max Q you can then do a boatload of
5:26:17
damage afterwards am I right yeah yeah oh wow you could really hear the
5:26:24
pain in or voice um the B away the Kindred try to remove jungl can stack up with the bom but to be honest like Z
5:26:32
still available uh Wukong is still available soani is still available and
5:26:38
so y yeah so y would be a neat combination it would be relatively neat
5:26:43
they would be missing a bit of magic damage they have true damage CHL every 3
5:26:48
seconds remember true you against that do you know what D plus are going to do they're going to pick
5:26:53
Zyra cuz why else would you ban the brand yeah they could actually I think it's a decent angle for it but you would
5:27:00
you lack a bit of engage to be fair is the only concern because there's no zigs no Kaiser honestly I feel like the com
5:27:06
would have worked better gone uh Leona and set why did I say Kaiser kais is not relevant here but there's a Sani ban
5:27:11
because if you if you had you can just Al stop the MF and it's really good with asual so but you know hand's 2020 uh
5:27:18
yeah Wukong and zenza both just there War's up uh and that's a big deal War has been very high priority here in the
5:27:24
lck thus far yeah he's in Arcane so everyone wants all right that's a knock turn well
5:27:31
they do like I I think that Wukong is probably yeah he's pretty good you know and if you're not aware it's making the
5:27:38
brand seem really confusing to me right now yeah just cuz I feel like Zyra is
5:27:43
just kind of better we saw bran played into Zena so maybe they were thinking well go Zena and then they just decided
5:27:49
not to anyway yeah uh okay somehow Aurora has just gten through to this
5:27:55
rotation true uh yeah right so they're going to lock
5:28:01
the they had to they had to ban brand right yeah they had to ban brand um I
5:28:07
think forever that brand is going to be in my brain and I like and this is the
5:28:13
thing because I'm just not at the intellectual level that uh that Barrel is and cuz Vladimir was up ah yes so how
5:28:23
like you can't play Aurora into Vladimir I've I've never seen it and remember last game they first banned first
5:28:29
rotation banned the Le in um okay it's lbl it's there is available what's funny
5:28:35
is showmaker looks so happy with the Vlad and and then the bong comes in he's like serious yeah yeah not even happy
5:28:42
about it Lee s's a fun one though for huk he is so good on this Champion we've been singing his Praises for quite some
5:28:47
time this draft makes little to no sense for me uh on D Plus's side not from what
5:28:53
it has turned into now like this you know the the pick composition the way that they can really make sure that they
5:29:01
kill someone and then like have a lot of Mobility around fights but the just the opportunities that they passed up I
5:29:07
think think I think you just you're using your brain a little bit too much that Max right I never this is two
5:29:13
compositions it's a Vibe check okay lots of skill expression true Champions where you can just you know look to outplay
5:29:19
your opponent it's just it's just hands itff now that's what the teams are looking at right looking for a bit of
5:29:25
hands stiff it Vibes this is what the series has come to and I'm here for it and honestly LeBlanc is the closest
5:29:31
thing to Vladimir because in the law there are a couple and spend a lot of time together you saw in the Cinematic
5:29:37
they have a lot of like Communications and stuff you know they're both uh you know similar Vibes and so I guess you
5:29:43
just yeah um that was a lot of friend words uh for showmaker there but I need
5:29:49
to do my very best to concentrate we need to do our best to get our brains into the level so that we can comprehend
5:29:56
this game everyone at home and here at Lark I hope that we can pull our energy
5:30:02
so that we can become smarter as a unit to be worthy of this game let's get into it
5:30:21
all right I'm starting to think that there's only D plus geia fans uh in l park right now they are so loud we are
5:30:28
on that side to be fair and they are also undefeated here in the lck cup you know sounds louder when they're
5:30:34
closer true I um if I had a nickel for every
5:30:40
time I said that a certain team was louder because I was on their side it would be a lot of nickels yeah I could
5:30:46
afford like I don't know lots of things uh a sandwich an egg like a boiled eggs
5:30:54
an egg sandwich an egg sandwich probably that's I could even afford to buy the
5:30:59
bread and the jam and like peanut butter and make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich at home with the amount of
5:31:05
nickels that I have I was about to say when you said said the bread in the jam I'm like why are you putting Jam in your
5:31:11
egg sandwiches what is wrong with you I couldn't afford the egg as well that
5:31:16
would be too much got to pick a Choose You know the monstrosity that came to mind when you said that have you ever
5:31:22
done that challenge with your friends where like you you have a selection of stuff to make sandwiches with and then they're like just put everything in it
5:31:29
no I did that once on a on a camp and it was it was disgusting that sounds dis
5:31:35
yeah there was creamed corn and the problem in ear is we often have veite I know you've got Mite in uh in in Britain
5:31:42
as well and it's just yeah that's not it um it was an incident anyway sh is here
5:31:48
in the mid lane because of course there is a lane swap going on uh we have the real MF towards the top side of the map
5:31:56
and closer is having a pretty good time here in this mid lane yeah Morgan just trying to get some XP but in dangerous
5:32:01
against eel drom notorious for having a lot of power on that level one with a Mystic shot and the Winter's bite yep
5:32:08
not sure if he has actually picked up any XP yet but Po's going down okay so he's got a little bit Po's got a decent
5:32:14
amount open to stve up the v h dive uh to the poti four they might be going for
5:32:21
this without the Wukong though this is very risky yeah this is a like a hook shot dive attempt and Polo is lying in
5:32:28
waight will finally show himself before any uh okay barrel stands behind the
5:32:34
minion beside the minion sorry rare bar they will they will get yeah
5:32:40
Rare Barrel disengage moment you know exactly and they do manage to get the plate and get themselves out but po
5:32:45
staving off disaster yeah I mean a good move from po there so covers his top laner gets the farm gets
5:32:53
XP pretty well and sha doing LeBlanc things this
5:32:58
is uh a champion that we know him very well for that was a zoning uh strike
5:33:03
from po there yep um this particular LeBlanc skin I always always just assume is his world skin by the way because he
5:33:10
uses it every single time and it just feels in the same Vibe as the DK World skins it's close a flash yeah remember
5:33:16
uh has ignite he has ignite yeah wait is this also the electrocute buff patch no
5:33:22
that's oh God I'm not looking forward to that as hype takes a turret shot and she was level three so pretty
5:33:29
comfortable there is a lot of vision here in this brush as all right let's see whether
5:33:35
lucid's going to be okay as the gy Wukong don't mind this
5:33:41
one and hype now just continuing to farm so things pretty even across the board
5:33:48
top Lan is anemic as usual that's how it goes I love how we get this really hype match up against ambessa both of them
5:33:56
just you know lot of dashes going going hm Y no yeah no it's just not happening
5:34:02
uh barrel tanks to f a lot of damage yeah oh God that's even more damage Pro
5:34:09
it and that's two more Mystic shots and he's dead and they'll take two plates for their trouble as well as Morgan
5:34:16
dashing around trying to get what he can 16 CS to the 10 of his Lane opposition yep if you're wondering why everyone
5:34:22
plays Cante all the time that's why cuz you can't do that to Cante yeah you can do it to Essa though
5:34:28
yeah not as fun in the swaps if swaps were a thing think how broken ambass would be I mean we've seen it even when
5:34:34
swaps were a thing she's still broken oh yeah oh but imagine if they weren't it would
5:34:41
be uh she'd be ner pretty immediately already has been since uh the first time we saw DK versus uh bro this year at the
5:34:49
kesper cup that was of course a series that Bros were able to win they did lose
5:34:54
a game in said series though as a 3-1 Victory they lost a game here as well exactly it's all coming together so we
5:35:01
know that they should win this game and if there was another game although there isn't because it's is the best of three
5:35:06
they should win that too is aiming once again back to facing off against Morgan this time we've transferred our
5:35:13
lanes and uh yeah the lane swap sadness continues for our top laners yeah not
5:35:18
getting any Rec here uh Grub's spawning up soon the thing is De have the bot
5:35:23
Lane on the top side so I mean that's free for them hak really needs to make his way down towards the boss side and
5:35:28
look to take this Dragon uh just trade and return unless he wants to try and maybe steal a grub but it seems very
5:35:33
risky feel right now though DK are feeling pretty good about it I feel like you look at any of these drafts that have Wukong and you're like if the early
5:35:40
game is kind of just not a whole lot of action then you're pretty happy as po
5:35:46
yeah he's not going to be uh making draker's life any different than what it was current up here she doesn't have TP
5:35:54
so's already managed to get one of the grubs so yeah uh just gets himself out of
5:36:00
there big rotation big investment that means that sh gets a whole lot of time yeah there's no TPS to respond to this
5:36:10
aiming Arcane shift yeah I think de's pretty happy with how this pans out they don't commit too heavily towards the top
5:36:15
side they get a grub they deny like the creature strength stacking and they just give you some alone time getting some XP
5:36:22
getting some Farm maybe a plate yeah probably going to help Morgan shove this one out so that he can answer
5:36:27
the push towards the bottom side as you can see Clos are actually down there trying to match and hex ultimatum is up
5:36:33
here for sh so once again we have DK with a composition that one ons really well actually um LeBlanc in a s Side
5:36:40
Lane is something that has worked very well in the past yeah I will say I feel like bro's
5:36:46
composition is okay into it it's not as good but yep you definitely hold your only side Lanes compared to some com are
5:36:52
pretty strong yeah like a Cory or something uh yeah bro will eventually
5:36:57
get their hands on this dragon and they also get the most of the grubs as well so if they're able to actually put up a good fight for the
5:37:03
next pack then 5 to one is actually a whole lot of pushing power so like you were saying saying both teams wanting to work in side Lanes could be a point of
5:37:11
contention as lucid's over the wall and hype going to flash immediately gets the Cyclone out of
5:37:18
lucid got the flash at a showmaker I I think pretty big you know I mean obviously it's ablong so not the the uh
5:37:25
most punishing cool down to be without but does it just feels like he he waited for like a split second until t uh plus
5:37:32
fully committed and then flashed yeah so good moves that angle as Morgan just
5:37:38
continuing to do his thing this is uh Shu potentially in trouble so hextech ultimatum has got to
5:37:45
be used very very well if he is going to survive let's see how this one's going to go he just doesn't get us doesn't
5:37:51
going to click the button yep well executed good kick from hamack to set it up we see some scrapping going on in the
5:37:58
top side Morgan's half HP Lucid is coming with no ult he could tune this look at aiming
5:38:03
Mana this is playable for Morgan yep see whether he can actually find the angle here can he press are that's the question as Winter's bite says probably
5:38:10
not although Barrel is in trouble calculated aiming gets that turret stacked up and even Luci it having a
5:38:16
taste to Morgan sitting pretty I think de can be just happy they didn't lose anyone dangerously close Morgan great
5:38:23
moves there waits as soon as Barrel gets aggro SS onto him to lock him up a
5:38:29
dangerously close encounter there didn't have the right setup I feel didn't have the Al from Lucid don't have Al from
5:38:35
barrel and aiming very low on Mana was a dangerous one to go for yeah and I feel like DK don't want to be scrapping too
5:38:40
much right now I think bro have a composition that does do very very well in the early stages DK want a couple of
5:38:45
items but let's have a look at sh not being able to play the game I think sh was waiting for like the stun to come out from H which is a bit more
5:38:52
telegraphed H back just walks up and kicks him and this one yeah just great Al on a
5:38:57
barrel catches him when he has aggro I didn't even see the animation for the public execution there really nicely
5:39:03
played for Morgan yeah and to not hit Lucid was huge oh it's just easy for the lord it's
5:39:13
easy D that's exactly how I expected him to react to that as well I'm so glad that Morgan is just can
5:39:21
damage well uh dashing around and uh we were talking about this guy as being
5:39:27
really far behind and struggling in the early game he's 15 CS up yeah he's chilling
5:39:32
absolutely as literally demonstrated yeah in his player cam yep just having a
5:39:38
sip of his water no worries yeah looks like robot Lane a bit under pressure we should just be able to clear this out
5:39:44
quickly uh aiming Barrel definitely would have appreciated more time in this 2v2 match up to punish it and uh that
5:39:51
has not really been given to them uh we do have grubs coming up in 20 seconds time that should be the next point of contention I think both of these teams
5:39:57
really wanting to get a few grubs under their belt taking some damage po as well win's
5:40:03
V stacking up has to crash down I think really where this match up takes off of the MF is once you you get that first item blood thirster it just becomes so
5:40:09
hard for aiming to walk up you just shake off all his poke and obviously aiming gets strong in like two item
5:40:14
Spike and stuff but that blood thst to spike is kind of just obnoxious for getting like lame priority uh do you see H starting up the
5:40:21
grubs yeah we see Morgan already moving up Shu has no TP again so yeah and they
5:40:28
are they pinging onto him he's actually going to stick around and it looks like they're not going to be denying any of
5:40:34
them so bro as we were talking about before those five grubs on the
5:40:39
cards aiming and Barrel still in position but I think if you're going to give it up give it up and they're going
5:40:45
to move back over towards this turret the wave going missing but oh the Make It Rain enough damage to take down that
5:40:52
Cannon feels absolutely fantastic look bot Lane nothing was lost Morgan had a great timing to roam up was there just
5:40:58
in case walks back doesn't have to be in TP Top Lane you know couple minions die and that's about it just really well
5:41:03
executed by bro covering uh their bases there and it's it's the ideal rotation you
5:41:09
want when you contest an objective where like you move everyone to it but you have like your s laner like just move into cover mid if needed so taking all
5:41:16
the boxes uh that five grubs already have that first dragon man so okay I've got an analogy
5:41:25
for you I'll uh see whether you think that it's right or whether it's stupid I feel like bro are kind of like a hybrid
5:41:32
car but the petrol engine ain't great you know and they were using the
5:41:38
petrol engine in game two y wasn't all that good but they have to so they can
5:41:43
charge so they can charge the electric engine and that thing that thing like I
5:41:49
mean it's ironic in this game but it might have been Kia that built it you know yeah I mean what I would say what I
5:41:55
would think is that they just have a regular engine but it's powered by the brox and some people were slacking last
5:42:02
game that's true so that could be that that actually sounds like it makes more sense mine was is very convoluted I'm
5:42:08
looking at you know if you're on that chat you haven't paid your brox things start to go par shape you got no one else to blame yep um you know what to do
5:42:16
chat by the way as all right Polo's coming down showmaker this uh could be a rough one as he's just running away from
5:42:23
the turret and he's fine uh the turret maybe not as fine as Barrel is moving over they're sweeping out the vision
5:42:30
full information given over to Bro here as Shu almost with his teleport back up but Morgan has his and that's going to
5:42:37
cause some troubles barel comes down and misses the winter bite yeah uh blood
5:42:42
just St picked up for hype so this is kind of what we see as you have a bit of struggle uh oh TP coming in from closer
5:42:50
he's just picked up the malignance yeah and this Dragon should belong to bro they have had such a monopoly on these
5:42:57
objectives so far this game so that will be the feat of strength going over there way two games in a row right deep plus
5:43:04
get the first two dragons they get CHX Soul they win rate soul and now we get the highest win rate Soul bro get F two
5:43:11
dragons they get the highest win rate soul that is your bro tax at work ladies and gentlemen yep can't spe
5:43:18
it it actually affects the RNG within the game it's coded that way it
5:43:25
is um that's what connecting your league account to Twitch
5:43:30
does and much more as aiming in hype uh facing up against one another you can
5:43:35
see that obnoxious uh blood you were talking about uh doing some work but you can see aiming still able to farm pretty
5:43:41
comfortably as closer this is will just take the Feats of Strength exactly right he uh will be able to utilize the
5:43:49
ultimate to get himself away but showmaker was not interested in that at all and so he's going to retain his uh
5:43:56
CS Advantage but not quite the gold advantage and it feels like bro have played the map so much better than DK so
5:44:01
far this game yeah we need DK to kind of come alive here where is Barrel's Great
5:44:06
Adventure you know true I think one of the problems is they kind of relying on showmaker make pressure or like lucid
5:44:13
and and shiu being the ones to get brao I know Barrel will try it but Braum not the best at being the one to create
5:44:19
pressure and I feel like it's just he's not Unleashed you know it's not a champ that I would be like yes let's get
5:44:24
barrel and bro yeah it doesn't feel good when it's leashed Barrel yeah you don't want leashed Barrel Unleashed Barrel is
5:44:30
the is the best barrel and he might be able to force it on this Brum we've seen that attempted in the past but not with
5:44:37
very much success yeah aiming on Ezreal though this is certainly a champion that he can hard carry on pretty close to
5:44:43
that two item Spike show a hitting level 11 is a big deal as well oh man I just saw no one had t two boots on bro they
5:44:49
get the feat of strength three oh immediately getting that value yeah you love to see
5:44:55
it yeah I mean this is the problem is that you hit a Q on PO it's actually relevant you hit one on hype it's just not no uh just immediately gets the uh
5:45:03
healing back and then the shield and then he's he's just more than fine huk is
5:45:10
waiting for what we may not ever know probably Barrel probably killing this
5:45:15
Ward yeah as Barrel is not going to get hit we get the zoom thanks strong look
5:45:21
at like the the creation of drama where it otherwise wouldn't be there from our observers I have to say it's
5:45:29
extraordinary because there's been one kill this game ladies and gentlemen it has not exactly been riveting stu oh
5:45:35
which which out account is it I didn't and oh I is it ruinous they did buff the chance
5:45:42
of ruinous turning up that's true so and maybe off screen the players have been hitting each
5:45:48
other cuz it wasn't on screen I tell you that yeah I want to hold my breath on
5:45:54
you know run out I do really like the amount of emotion that The Observers put into just a small Zoom y of like shiu is
5:46:02
here by himself on the map as Lucid has started this off but hok's the one to uh
5:46:09
continue it barl can stand beside the monkey as it goes in but don't know about this one
5:46:16
four members towards this uh Rift Herald top laners do have TP yeah like Morgan's
5:46:23
pulling the tricker first Shi just isn't he is he is not true barage comes in
5:46:29
that is huk with Smite and so that will secure it AI he is doing his very best
5:46:34
showmakers trir impression as aiming will stand his ground for now does have Barrel there with a door that's
5:46:41
successful immediately shell goes down shu is looking to lock down this turret will be able to do so so success on that
5:46:49
front but it looks like this outer turret in mid is also going to go over H could be in trouble as barrels diving
5:46:54
forward finds the winter fight hug just uh yeah yeah we saf guard she actually TP there to move in they wanted to
5:47:00
punish the overextension for the mid Tower but unfortunately not able to do anything it was a good move from bro and
5:47:06
importantly made the Le sin be the one to uh Ride The Herald definitely the
5:47:12
preferred choice I would say yeah and um there's one thing that's really standing out to me and that is DK think that they
5:47:19
win in the late game you know we've all had those games where it's like don't worry we win late says the the viager in
5:47:25
the mid lane just don't die says the nasis in the Top Lane I'm not going to lie I say that every game where I'm down
5:47:30
play zigs every game well true even when I'm not playing zigs I just always you get the other one too
5:47:38
yeah what the heck pick it up but I I just always say don't worry we out skill we out skill it's not just about the
5:47:44
Champions it's like we just like they'll have cassid in re and soul for some reason they have both and I'm like no no no we out skill we out skill we have we
5:47:50
have bigger brains our IQ skills will yeah you just got to you know just hype
5:47:55
yourselves up well you can also do things in the early to mid game to put yourself in a better position to win
5:48:01
ladies and gentlemen um that's the bro that is the Bro way and they are certainly set up for success here five
5:48:07
grubs getting to work on this top side with cler just by himself taking this turret down DK it's a bit of Milling
5:48:14
about uh outside of this where showmaker is Dashing on top and hok's dead the chains connect
5:48:22
Barrel I was going to say why but that is the one word you're not allowed to use it's just kill if he's using his ult
5:48:28
and his flash you think he doesn't deserve the kill I don't I don't think that he doesn't deserve the kill good um
5:48:35
yeah so that means he going to get drag going to stop that cloud Soul stacking uh pretty nice I stop that you mean
5:48:42
they're going to start it that's true as Morgan is fighting Shu okay and winning
5:48:48
for now but the dragon is just going to go down aiming takes a combo from closer and that's 50% of his health bar can you
5:48:53
believe that Run's getting buff next PATH oh some of those tweets were
5:48:58
absolutely hilarious um the uh yeah I I can't believe it actually as it turns
5:49:04
out okay um let's have a look at this one more time this was finally DK making a
5:49:11
proactive move H back I just don't think the Raptors are worth it look your whole blue side jungle is up you just taken
5:49:17
anything there and he also could have not flashed because the whole reason that uh show makeer flash flashes yeah
5:49:24
yeah yeah he's still it's okay yeah he'll learn I feel like sometimes I see a
5:49:29
Flash and I'm like you're just trying you trying to show that like I'm really trying it's like just save it yeah just
5:49:36
you don't well Flash and Le in notoriously not very high value so it's fine yeah yeah yeah yeah what could you
5:49:41
do with a Flash and Le in no idea I certainly couldn't make it work as a
5:49:46
hype and will just move back towards his mid lane and you know double up aiming pry damage there yeah aiming pretty big
5:49:53
spike two items with the manamune fully stacked yep still probably not going to be able to do any damage to Hype but uh
5:49:59
we got double Trinity forces as well uh for sh and Lucid so that's certainly good news triple overall though yeah
5:50:06
that is a lot the it's a double eclipses I mean you look at Morgan hand items ver
5:50:11
ooh Flash the barrel respect is it where it needs to be yeah engage B
5:50:17
yeah as Clos it back to the Top Lane he's going to shove that one out and what are we looking for as far as our
5:50:23
next objective it looks like aan is what's on the minds of these players another Winters bite no flash for that
5:50:29
one uh for poo unfortunately yeah so it's uh I I just verified it's the vicious adakan oh okay and it must have
5:50:37
been Clos the intent rakan is to uh instill more action cuz the buff you
5:50:44
know how like yeah you could fight without and if you die you're not really punished for it so you know despite it
5:50:49
being what I feel is a relatively action-packed game I don't know there's been a kill every 10 minutes yeah you
5:50:55
know like that is that is pretty action pack yeah it's been pretty HCK which is why I'm I'm confused why it's a varous
5:51:00
out of can but clearly you know it's not enough uh they want more blood so little bit excessive it is noxious you know
5:51:07
they're very I'm looking forward to when they buff it again because obviously it's at the wrong spot this is a ruinous angle yeah yeah for sure agreed yeah
5:51:15
people that struggle to pick up sarcasm would struggle with our broadcast I think they really would um first taking
5:51:22
everything completely wow you'd have some opinions wouldn't you yeah oh it's kind of
5:51:28
fascinating I want to hear from someone like that now as huk going to be clearing out this Ward and bro grouped
5:51:34
up outside of Morgan for this uh this arakan situation here
5:51:40
trop barrage there's nothing at all and this is this is what we've been waiting
5:51:46
for a moment where showmaker can sort of dance around the edges of these fights or at least the edges of his enemy team
5:51:52
because there's no real fights happening um and really cause some damage two items almost complete when that shadow
5:52:00
flame is done he is going to be really hitting hard I feel like this is on me cuz I I sold this game as oh wait oh in
5:52:07
he goes there's the Cyclone angle another knock up as they get onto hype in the backline but he survives for so
5:52:13
long she turns up and they do manage to take him down it's a double kill as finally the Camille does something in
5:52:20
this game three and the rest of bro have to scatter the arakan going to be taken
5:52:26
down and deep plus wow they were lying dormant for so long and finally the bear
5:52:32
after hibernation wakes up and bites their head off Le it finds the angle gets a great knock up there and hype
5:52:39
does his best to survive but does go down and let's I want to watch what Barrel did in that fight I'm fascinated
5:52:45
I cannot wait oh cuz I was busy looking at the monkey and I didn't see what the true carry was doing yeah and block
5:52:51
closes damage yeah actually lands a Mystic shot back yeah he's getting the
5:52:58
value and then she just slides in picks up two kills guys I've been in the game this whole time trust me that was
5:53:06
actually a sick fight um Lucid really finding the angle and there is that shadow flame that we were talking about
5:53:11
it only gets worse from here for the gig Chads I'm sensing a severe lack of brox in that chat if you want to create a
5:53:19
turnaround there must have been a now is the time there must have been a lull in the brox yeah uh that's my only
5:53:24
explanation for that situation yep I'm waiting for Deon says to really put the call into action uh because we need to
5:53:30
see it as po his way out will successfully do so so and a half on this
5:53:37
B the thing as well with d Plus have arakan is there's so many Towers them to take but also that comp is very trixy
5:53:43
right there's a lot of Champions were just already hard to kill and now you don't really benefit for killing them
5:53:49
yeah and they can uh yeah just walk up to this out of turret in mid lane and what are you supposed to do about it the answer is go away maybe just give it up
5:53:58
as we almost have yeah all of these alts back up and available once again as Sher loves the situation as well as closer
5:54:05
throws down the Alti they're try to get them out of here but closer is's just going to die for his trouble Lucid takes a vacation he's going to head back to
5:54:11
base and DK still fighting huk now the kick going to get the kick out on Shu
5:54:17
who says all right well I'll go home and DK showmaker and Barrel holding on the buff for another minute but uh they take
5:54:24
down the out of turret they get a decent amount of damage onto the inner and they kill two and they should be able to pick
5:54:29
up this dragon with two dead on the side of bro well it'll be one second it's looking pretty cloudy isn't it it is the
5:54:37
quad Cloud the dream we need the game to last long enough Dragon option yeah so
5:54:42
gets decent amount of damage on OPP it's a good interrupt from po reads where Luci it is Clos against the Big Al is
5:54:48
immediately punished and jumped on uh and you know it's it's high value from the ultimate in return but yeah the
5:54:54
bullet time was really good he just not trading that well because of the buff and the the H the interrupt the uh
5:55:00
the hook shot sorry the kick that interrupt the hook shot was good still feeling too little too late
5:55:06
as hok uh hits the void where his Bramble back used to
5:55:13
be and I wonder what the state of this Top Lane matchup is going to be now St Gage picked up for both of
5:55:20
them after the initial items eclipse and Trinity Force but it feels like Camille with the true damage with the ability to
5:55:27
do so much work in these side Lanes feel like the scaling is possibly still in her favor is that how it works with uh
5:55:33
Camille versus ambessa I don't really know the match up that well don't know the match up that well either I'll be honest um I feel like true damage kind
5:55:41
of says late gamees yeah but the thing with amb best is you get so much percentage pen of your all and so much
5:55:47
healing true and she just broken and there's the release St situation is Polo he's going
5:55:54
for it okay the rest of bro making their way over Lucid with the Cyclone is trying to do something here as hex
5:56:00
ultimatum will push them around the fight Lucid staying alive for so long but huk he's able to take him down in the end and Barrel is lying on the floor
5:56:07
as well only three members left as aiming will finally turn up public execution onto the Camille and aiming
5:56:15
you can possibly just kill all of them as Sher gets into the back line deon's losing his mind but it's still a pretty
5:56:21
good trade in all honesty yeah I don't think you can complain about the situ oh closer Shu oh true shoer rage that was
5:56:29
his teammate yeah doesn't do much damage when it's on your own team very chaotic
5:56:35
fights I feel like like we're getting in this situation break it down for me a let's do it it's they engage on Lucid
5:56:41
who who isolated on this flank and do a pretty good job of just kind of exploding him as the rest of the team
5:56:46
moves in they're kind of just moving in to Clos his old Barrel gets kicked into the bullet time and goes down again just
5:56:52
just super chaotic here but hamach is doing everything he can great Mega cone there as well from H yeah and then
5:56:59
Morgan try to catch sh but that Shield is just massive show makers to kill you jungler just for fun um you did do that
5:57:07
but overall favorable fight for bro and they're finding an angle it's good to see life back in them whoever paid their
5:57:13
bro attx there exactly and I'm seeing it there are definitely some uh some some brox
5:57:20
enjoyers and aiming doing a lot of damage see it's highlighting but look at the bottom barl
5:57:27
had about 1,500 more damage than po I think could you do that if you don't put the extra points into your que I'll uh
5:57:33
I'll give you the answer the answer is no could not do that as all right who's face checking it's Barrel as aiming now
5:57:41
going to find some aggression showmaker as well just pushing them away from this Baron it's only been up for 3 minutes
5:57:46
haven't really seen too much Focus around it but uh she pushing in a side lane and
5:57:52
we've got two minutes left until the dragon okay big spikes for brother got rabadons for closer and infinity edge
5:57:59
for hype so that's big and hype really does not care about uh his full uh Pizza
5:58:07
of strength yeah what's the point cuz his feet are pretty weak right you know what they gave Casio piia a buff because
5:58:12
he doesn't benefit from Pizza of strength where is the MF buff cuz you just never builds
5:58:18
boots well I yeah I don't know whether it's the same same situation but maybe they should consider it you know even
5:58:24
when magical Footwear because he's that opposed to paying money for any sort of feet equipment yeah feed equipment yeah
5:58:31
I like that uh all right hum checking the brush gets a control Ward down is moving real quick as barrel stands
5:58:38
beside aiming as a good support does aiming makes it out of there they are
5:58:43
playing some good defense here on DK's side not letting them get in to get Vision on this Baron but the amount of
5:58:49
stalling that's happening will mean that we'll have some crossmap situations right it will be sole Point available
5:58:54
for both teams and baron buff up so some Swift decision- making will be required
5:58:59
Y and by Swift swift decision making is something that's not been required so far this particular game very slow it's
5:59:06
a cloud Source it needs to be swift decision making know do you want to be swift or do you want to have Baron yeah
5:59:13
H probably Baron yeah if it was Soul yeah that' be different as Lucid waits
5:59:19
for the ward to go down and then kills it that is the state of this game right now that epitomized what's been
5:59:24
happening in this game yeah Ward go down enemy kill Ward walk
5:59:30
away I can only imagine how much gold has been spent on control WS in this game Oh by the supports I mean you look
5:59:36
at the items it's just it's like a zeks and a Kindle jet the classic finish your
5:59:42
first item and a Kindle gem full build baby yeah however much gold you've had in this game it's like you ain't buying
5:59:48
you ain't buying any more items incredibly Barrel has actually started to go towards the second item yeah barl has actually disabled his uh second his
5:59:57
other item slots just so that he can have more processing power y uh I say as
6:00:02
he buys a whole bunch of random stuff so all of his items okay this is uh just a
6:00:08
free dragon uh-huh well triple cloud dragon sometimes in action is action
6:00:16
guys um what about when it isn't it it wasn't this is not an example of that um
6:00:21
but sometimes you know it is you should give that pitch to Riot for the
6:00:27
ruiners every game ruiners I honestly think that it should just be a coin flip like just just make it like the dragons
6:00:34
yeah I think every you know maybe sometimes like red red buff and blue buff don't spawn when they normally use
6:00:40
sometimes it's only on the side oh true every sometimes everything's like a kindred Mark sometimes Baron spawns in
6:00:45
the dragon pit Dragon spawns in the baron pit just you know anything can happen just just make it more I like you
6:00:51
know my favorite coin flips where the Scuttle crab originally when when it would spawn on one side be super
6:00:56
valuable and also uh with Kindred when it's like Oh either have a mark Or I don't cuz I lost the coin flip it's more
6:01:02
coin flipping everything should be in fact I think minion wave shouldn't be consistent it's like one wave
6:01:09
is sometimes you just get a double wave and there's no wave in mid sometimes there like four cannons
6:01:16
two m c why not oh that would be fantastic it'
6:01:21
make the game a bit more spicy you know we got to we got to we really have to
6:01:26
get into foon's DMs I reckon MADD had really appreciate oh he'd love it he'd love it he would absolutely oh man we're
6:01:33
so smart and we're given so much time because there's nothing happening in this game the amount of brainstorming
6:01:38
that we're getting done here oh it's so good tell I think a lot more would happen if suddenly like three waves show
6:01:45
up and made I'm just waiting like 11 Cannon minions just marching towards you
6:01:50
I wonder if I'll be out of freeze this di oh and there's like a a. 1% chance that like a super minion spawns so like
6:01:56
sometimes wave one this is sometimes you going be really lucky it's like Le it's a Goa game in the game level one there
6:02:03
just a super minion and you just can't defend think I mean I don't think people would
6:02:10
be happy about it but man I would be entertained as Barrel is by himself that is able to stand beside a minion that in
6:02:17
our theoretical League of Legends could have been a super minion it could have been we're now heading back towards this
6:02:23
Dragon pit not up for another minute 2 and a half minutes sorry as uh bro still want to try and start a fight I think
6:02:29
they're getting ancy yeah we can see this 131 though from D plus beautifully working long top we are we are hurting
6:02:37
just keep running hurting you have three Cloud dragons just just keep wait walking all right there's the flash
6:02:43
Magnus storm is lucid's the target the ulti goes down but the Cyclone's there closa has to flash get out of the way and he's so incredibly low and that's
6:02:49
lucid's clone she was going to find closa and then lose him but does have hextech ultimatum and even though this
6:02:55
is what bro were looking for it is not working for them whatsoever Lucid goes in then he's out again it's the baiten
6:03:01
switch the smoke and mirrors and the bullet time is not hype's best time showmaker is just I don't care about
6:03:08
this game at all he's just going to try and win as hook shot goes nowhere but doesn't even really matter the answer is
6:03:13
yes says Morgan as Barrel getting taken down so low the kick out baming but it just takes him to safety and now Morgan
6:03:19
with all the dashes barrel with no fear at all when he probably should have some and now Lucid flashing forward looking
6:03:26
for hype but hype is just killing everyone just just kind kind of trying
6:03:32
to win the game yeah exactly right traker is doing the best my God aiming
6:03:37
does it he takes down the 8 carry but that is one Nexus turret that showmaker is able to take and if we have a look at
6:03:44
the money I don't know what the the gold was before the fight but I think probably still good for DK that was just
6:03:51
so I mean this whole time showmakers like guys just pushing top he doesn't have TP but I think even if he did I he
6:03:57
just doesn't care yeah he's above this right and I mean even she was thinking like maybe I just let him live so that I
6:04:03
can take an inhibitor turret yeah he was thinking about it but there is actually a wave deeper uh past them but in the end joins the fight very Scrappy de's
6:04:11
kind of caught between okay well we don't want them to recall we want to fight but we also don't just want to die
6:04:17
but then they're kind of like Barrel must have said something like no no no we're dying yeah we're in we're all in
6:04:23
and he's like showmaker end yeah aiming had some slick moves here the Arcane shift there so the kick went the the
6:04:29
direction uh really well played got a lot of Mystic shots down here Lucid goes in on hyp and a get the damage down and
6:04:36
then in the end the fact that it's a 1 V3 situation Arcane shift just went on cool down flash is over hits the q w a
6:04:43
god slick slick with it really slick well Vision now available here as Lucid
6:04:49
gets a bit of a peak into the baron and we are back into the action once again has barrels over the wall trop baraj
6:04:55
connects onto closer he wants to have a higher health bar than that as now Hypes in trouble hex tech ultimate him oh no
6:05:00
he's in the blender and he is not coming out aing aiming does get picked off as well so no no more lady carries in this
6:05:07
battle it's all about Shu and showaker for the damage on DK's side Morgan as well can he survive he's got so much
6:05:12
healing closer is in so much trouble though and he's relied upon so much to get all the work done for the Bros and
6:05:18
the hook shot will stun up Morgan the Lord surviving for so long Shu almost dead and poo an afterthought but he'll
6:05:26
go down the Flash Forward and there it is the surprise Teo is sarcasm here for
6:05:32
showmaker he is not surprised about the outcome of that fight is DK they look to
6:05:37
take down the last remaining Nexus turret and uh they look to remain undefeated here taking down their rivals
6:05:44
in the Casper cup it was still an arduous Series game one was a rough one
6:05:49
there is a back door bonus so this turret takes a fair bit but finally the minion wave turns up and DK they will
6:05:55
remain undefeated here in the lck cup it feels like that game pretty slow
6:06:02
and steady and then D plus just decided it's time it's time to make things happen the1 was having a lot of pressure
6:06:09
and bro just didn't have a way to respond to it forced to fight forced to contest these objectives forced to stop Baron and D+ were just kind of vibing
6:06:17
this VI and you could see they were just completely fine with how things were
6:06:22
playing out this feels to me like a like a situation where it's like the Mighty
6:06:28
Ducks you know they get a new coach and the coach tries to make them do something that's not really them that
6:06:33
was game one yeah game two they were like no uh we we just want to do this one
6:06:39
ourselves they sent him out and they just vibed and they did that for the rest of the series and came out with a
6:06:45
victory I do want to talk about bro a little bit though because I think that Bros game one was phenomenal League of
6:06:51
Legends game two you know like that weird hybrid car analogy it just wasn't
6:06:57
really it we didn't really see it from them this game very very slow we saw some of the the Bro moments but not
6:07:04
quite enough and so what we need to take away from this is that you are not investing
6:07:10
enough Channel points into bro everyone just went you know Channel points game one and they forgot about it they closed
6:07:16
closed chat didn't pay the Bro tax after that and you can't really be doing that like if you are a true bro fan you
6:07:22
should be sitting at zero at the end of a series like this y all of them bro every single game bro lose a series I
6:07:29
lose my channel points that's how it goes that is how it goes that is how it goes Honestly though I actually think that's what happened is that after game
6:07:35
one they were all Chanel points G I know Valdez definitely bit the dust on that one no Channel points left for the BRX
6:07:41
trying to scramble them together they're looking in like the in in some coat in the in the wardrobe it has Channel
6:07:47
points in the pocket yeah no no it doesn't that's not how it works cuz it's electronic it's not even in like the
6:07:53
hallway drawer that your dad normally puts the change into just couldn't find it it was already rated yeah and uh I I
6:08:00
I was I was honored to cast this series though this was a whole lot of fun little bit less action here in game
6:08:06
number three but the rest of it it is just pure entertainment for both of these teams just a hard game to play MF
6:08:13
in I'm not going to lie and show it and Sh I feel like really was such a tandem Duo yeah where like every single time
6:08:20
they're approaching from roughly the same distance different angles you know one of them leads the other one follows
6:08:26
and they're just such a threat on the backline it's so hard to play cuz they're both you can't you can't engage
6:08:31
on them they're mobile you don't have that much reliable engage and they they just shave off the edges of every fight
6:08:38
right and so bro always coral and like otherwise that happens right just gets in and this was bros hard engage attempt
6:08:47
it just makes the fight feel small you know you have such a limited space you can work with if you step outside that space he dead as closer did uh this was
6:08:55
when it got a little bit funky but still fun and fresh yeah and this Arcane shift
6:09:01
like you were talking about keeping aiming alive is Ezreal always a treat to watch and was once again and this you
6:09:06
might be looking at you're like oh bro's winning unless you look at the mini map in which case you're like what there's a
6:09:13
there's a guy down there now we're going to have a listen as D+ yeah they find hype and bro
6:09:20
managed to get the exchange like H played that so clean finds the kick flash onto aiming executes the Ezreal
6:09:26
difficult Target to lock down but the ensuing fight DK were able to make work as Barrel went down to like 100 health
6:09:32
and still managed to get out and he's still going forward oh the man has no regard for his own
6:09:40
life and look at that hands off keyboard he's like man that was close showmaker says hello oh my
6:09:49
goodness this is the scariest version of showmaker one we have this season truly truly truly and you know they managed to
6:09:55
do it they managed to go undefeated team to do it undefeated huge achievement and and I think it's representative of their
6:10:01
Play It's been it has been fun it's been good vibes it's been showmaker having a great time but the play has really
6:10:07
been toast a lot of the time you know game one but most of the time and the
6:10:12
picks have been Insanity like showmaker is one on set zillian Zoey trendir so
6:10:19
many different things I think this guy's like really living The Fearless dream I think maybe that's where brok struggled
6:10:26
a bit I feel like the MF wasn't really working that well in this game just with the threats that D+ have but I feel like
6:10:31
we've already seen D+ be our best team and best of three faers we're going to be going at the best of five fearless
6:10:37
and I think that is only going to make them stronger yeah imagine where showmaker goes when he's finished with
6:10:43
the trir game and the set game you know like I don't know there's uh I I I I
6:10:48
don't know and I'm very much looking forward to finding out also looking forward to finding out who picks up player of the match um I imagine it
6:10:56
might be the guy that you know was in side lanes for two games in a row unless it's sh that collects it and I think
6:11:03
this is more for the n lock in and actually heard some booze from the audience there maybe some of them
6:11:08
disagreeing with this choice I imagine it was a difficult one to make I think they the the chance ah okay thank
6:11:15
goodness cuz I I it felt like it wasn't really uh an uplifted maneuver because I
6:11:20
personally thought the showmaker was sort of the main character for this series I think I vote for him uh ultimately for Shu because I think the
6:11:28
Nar game you really set that one up he did the The Hop Crush wallup four times like a charm but then also the Camille
6:11:34
game like he when he did join the fights he was doing a lot in those as well fin angles certainly was but now it is time
6:11:39
to hear from sh so let's throw it over to Dear for the translation thank you very much guys
6:11:46
this is dear for the P interview translation joined by Shu on the side of
6:11:53
the what a support from the F you get to finish the group battle
6:12:00
with an undefeated 5-0 score this is your first P how do you feel
6:12:07
no I haven't been getting any p and I really wanted to make sure that
6:12:12
I get one today being able to get P makes me very
6:12:20
happy but I also feel like I didn't perform as well as to deserve the P so I
6:12:26
want to make sure to do even better next time you must have been so disappointed
6:12:33
for not getting P yeah I was a little
6:12:39
disappointed yeah today okay savings Brion showed their potential but with a
6:12:46
reverse sweep you Avent yourself for the kesa cup how satisfying was
6:12:52
that yeah I was so upset after that CA cup and I've always made myself and
6:12:59
reminded myself that we would have to get a Revenge so I'm so happy that we're able to achieve that
6:13:09
your in game you really showed how good at at
6:13:14
the macro management you are so how do you manage to sort of play out those Sidelines
6:13:21
really well honestly for you to be successful at
6:13:28
pushing sidelanes I think you just really need to have a good team and plus
6:13:34
a good ad so I think that's what really allowed me to be successful
6:13:40
today so with all the Lan
6:13:46
swap you know we hear that Top Lane is not fun that you get Dove all the time
6:13:52
you have to do a 3v one or 4v1 so what are your thoughts on this you know yeah all the patches that
6:13:59
actually have come out do lead to these sort of results with all the the top
6:14:11
Dives I really hope that in the future they're able to adjust the game so that
6:14:18
I can start playing some top Champions that still a lot of damage and actually have influence in the
6:14:26
game and yeah you guys have been able to show a lot of unique picks
6:14:32
so with the Playoffs being being a best of five format can we expect even more
6:14:38
unique picks than diverse think so it's it's all due to
6:14:45
the Fearless draft yeah I feel like I do have some
6:14:51
maybe one to two more cards up my sleeve
6:14:56
that I haven't been able to show yet in preparation for the playoffs can
6:15:04
can we here asue okay can I go ahead
6:15:18
now fans are shouting you can do
6:15:27
it all the fans joined in to give him moral
6:15:32
support congratulations again and that's the end of the interview with you and back to the space thank
6:15:43
you thank you very much dear aaya and to support sh we will do it together one
6:15:48
two [Music] three congrats you and the rest of D
6:15:53
plus Kia in just in case you couldn't tell I'm all out of points the brox is a little bit too much you getting the job
6:16:00
done as well as D+ in a very fun fashion where we started the day thinking man
6:16:06
they're having so much fun everything seems wrapped up if they take it seriously they end up getting the victory here and in style the biggest
6:16:14
difference between a comedy and a tragedy is the ending and for DK specifically so many of these moments
6:16:20
feel reminiscent of how they played over the last couple of years but they just keep winning yeah right like we have a
6:16:27
DK that used to do that's that bot Lane play they did that against T1 I think it
6:16:34
was play of in summer and they just outre they lost the game I mean it just it was just done especially this game I
6:16:39
think uh bro had really great moment until like 18 minutes they got all objectives in the map but somehow I
6:16:47
think they kind of fell off we're going to see it but I think we need to too P first yeah uh let's get to it so Shu
6:16:54
getting the victory here in the P but you could have gone multiple different ways one 2 3 four there for showmaker
6:17:02
one of the jungle for Lucid here by you guys I feel like the Shu one was the we
6:17:07
while we were brainstorming sh was like oh yeah that makes a lot of sense it it really does I'm just shocked that there's no Barrel votes yeah you know
6:17:15
like as with as with any his poppy man it really it still was me wondering if
6:17:20
that isn't why I still don't really fully comprehend what was going on there uh I think showmaker is no-brainer elbow
6:17:26
for the champion pool plus the fact that he uh did have the Swain game but we generally kind of gloss over losing
6:17:32
games I went for L because I thought he had great games in all re uh and I feel wuk in particular really fit with both
6:17:39
what he's been doing and how DK played out this uh this series and I have been known to be a bit of a lucid Fanboy a
6:17:46
little bit Yeah the Korean fans now know it even better now yeah thanks G Lucid fan booy all right uh what did you have
6:17:53
here I mean you are Lucid fan and I am a big fan of showmaker and welcome to his
6:17:58
pool he has so many girlfriends right now I mean so sad that uh ra didn't get
6:18:05
an invitation for showmakers pool vacation but yeah I mean one day one me
6:18:12
girlfriends he played Swain and trendir one day you know I mean well D this is bad
6:18:17
advice we' been over this actually but anyways I it's so sad that we cannot see
6:18:23
Syra in his pool one day what all right thank you
6:18:29
Z we got that one there look I'm sure I'm telling you now that's going to be like half the comments oh yeah please
6:18:35
don't let me down that better be all the comments All right what did we get on the Korean side undefeated record maker
6:18:42
of course that showmaker again just Flex in the pool as you got to stay away from
6:18:47
that one all right and first Lucid now sh where are D+ finding all of these rookies Pony's on to something this
6:18:54
they've just been pumping out Talent here yeah and they've been shipping off half of them to other regions by the way
6:19:00
you guys I don't know let's bring that up I don't know if the camera is high enough quality to see
6:19:08
the for all the talent all right here's our last one from cloud Templar uh I'm your hu you're my shiu you're the best
6:19:17
so basically his real name is Hu Cloud Templar and now Su is the best top laner
6:19:23
so he's kind of connecting it you know yeah yeah yeah Cloud Templar just again always looking forward to what he puts
6:19:29
for the P let's take a look at uh this unique style of play by plus trusting
6:19:35
their composition because they gave up not just one not just two but five grubs
6:19:41
two towers and a ton of things here at 17 minutes whereas D+ you know they're like okay yeah we're we're fine yeah I
6:19:47
think their only rotation was really great they got old objective that they wanted I thought maybe DK could look for
6:19:54
the trades but I think the high Tempo from bro was just on point so that's why they couldn't get it but uh until one
6:20:01
point I think uh bro if didn't make a mistake on that one point they could
6:20:08
actually Snowball the game really well yeah the one of the reasons why I think uh I I didn't consider sh as much as I
6:20:15
probably should have is because his early laning phase was actually a bit rough because of the constant rotations
6:20:21
DPL did a really good job of keeping him out of the one of Mesa because it is one of those matchups where Mesa early pommels you but then you're Camille late
6:20:28
game there are very few champions in the game that can match you so as a result DK was able to keep up in Gold
6:20:33
relatively well um but uh maybe we can roll the clip because this is where Deon unfortunately
6:20:39
also started to feel the Heartbreak I lost my mind um because this right here
6:20:45
the C highlight as well there's your own blue side jungle is up and this is what guarantees denial of Soul point and this
6:20:53
is kind of where it feels like you know then they get the first Drake and that's where bro kind of lost grip of the match
6:20:58
I mean just right before the third Drake you know uh as a DK side you're kind of feeling forced to go to the Drake cuz as
6:21:05
you mentioned is a sole point right so that was huge Advantage for the bro side
6:21:10
but that one little mistake leing getting caught kind of fell off after that so yeah because then you're behind
6:21:17
Tempo which then led to the next fight that we had at the Drake and again just
6:21:22
great stuff earlier by Barrel to burn the flash from the rail knowwhere to go and uh they engage right away yeah uh it
6:21:29
was really great engage by Cu uh Lucid once again it was really great engage
6:21:35
right on uh to the face on Misfortune but at the same time I was wondering why
6:21:40
they were just walking up the Drake pit because there was no Drake it was 1 minute 30 seconds just before it spawns
6:21:48
so I don't see the reason why they have to walk on the river side I I it's still
6:21:53
it it is completely baffling to me that Brion are currently they're one and four
6:21:59
yeah and they beat gen G20 yes and like
6:22:04
they they weren't even out of this game there were moments where it felt like they could still make it happen I do think that compositionally once Camille
6:22:11
gets over the hump we saw that the fights became n unplayable but this this point I'm telling you every single DK
6:22:17
fan I know I felt it on the inside in my heart a sinking feeling because I've seen them do these things and they have
6:22:25
not always worked out so many times right so many times like oh yeah it's fine showmaker can end doesn't have L
6:22:31
pain um not and he doesn't and he has no
6:22:36
TP by the way he's running a guy yeah still pushing okay but then
6:22:43
crucially Shu arrives here but he actually has to use his ultimate and then they could have just
6:22:48
left they could have left it at that but no it's DK I got we got to maybe maybe I
6:22:54
can end maybe guys guys okay keep fting keep fting keep fighting maybe maybe
6:22:59
Auto attacks maybe maybe not uh yeah I'm going to keep going go in going going
6:23:05
guys we went in showmaker you're ending right
6:23:12
showmaker uh showmaker base breaker unfortunately took a little bit longer than I think he was
6:23:17
planning uh and this ends up working out nonetheless but this is the type of moments that you look towards if you're
6:23:24
a DK fan and you go against other teams I don't think we get away with this I
6:23:29
mean aiming getting the kill there at the end also pretty pretty uh nice little parting gift but but either way
6:23:35
D+ get the victory they do it the fun way they close the door on a perfect lck
6:23:40
cup group stage as it's 5 to zero they are the number one seed in the playoffs
6:23:47
along with geneng G and KT rster DRX has locked up third place for the playing
6:23:53
stage and Nong shim's fate still yet to be oh not not Nong shim uh bnk thex's
6:23:59
fate still left to be decided it's very simple tiebreakers aside you win you're
6:24:05
in for bnk FX you lose you're out and uh the team that's going to be watching
6:24:11
that most closely will be the DN Automotive freaks they will be the ones on The Chopping Block if the victory
6:24:17
goes the way of bnk it's been a fantastic day here at the lck we appreciate all of you from around the
6:24:24
