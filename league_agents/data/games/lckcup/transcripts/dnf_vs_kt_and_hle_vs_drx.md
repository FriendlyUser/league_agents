[Applause] [Music] say Mano which means happy Lunar New
31:08
Year a time for you at home to try to get your resolutions back on track and a
31:13
time here for the lck cup week three group battle teams to make their dreams
31:20
come true welcome to the space everyone Deon alongside wiid and wolf happy Lunar New Year y'all good job Deon thank you
31:27
that was good Korean yeah was it good Korean so in Korean like when you say it it means like to get new Fortune that's
31:32
the bul uh that you say so we'll see what teams uh can get their bu uh in this upcoming Final week of the group
31:39
battle cuz a lot is on the line you know we're we're really going to find out who's going straight to playoffs who's
31:44
going plays and who's getting eliminated it's not uh group versus group anymore it's more like you have to fight each
31:50
others you know for for the teammate so it's going to be really rough but at the same time you have to do it otherwise
31:57
you're going to play only five games for LSK cup and you're out yeah you don't get to play until April five games mate
32:04
it' be very very scary let's take a look at the standings again group Elder has won the group battle as D+ sits on top
32:13
the only undefeated team in the lck on the opposite side for group Baron the big battle is going to be on the bottom
32:19
side of those standings as bro DN Freaks and bnk FX all trying to find their way
32:27
into playing yeah I mean this is we're really getting down to the final final standings here
32:33
and talking about standings good job weed um on an eight out of 10 we all did a little bit better this week I would
32:40
say yeah for sure and I think uh the difference point was because of the HL
32:47
and versus DK right uh I I already said that DK is going to win walls this year so yeah oh my God Prince nine out of 10
32:55
only Pro pick that's a prediction yeah he was he was on point with the
33:01
predictions now as we took a look at the standings earlier here's how things will shake up in terms of the current
33:08
standings and where they're going to go with group Elder already winning the group battle first through 3D will make
33:14
it straight to the playoffs where fourth and fifth will go into playin now on group Baron first through fourth will
33:20
make it to play-ins and the fifth team will be eliminated and again will not play until the lck regular season kicks
33:27
off in April so going to be a uh a a a tough tough road there for them yeah you
33:33
might thought group out there is just chilling for now but you have to get higher seed because I mean even though
33:38
it's PLS like you got to show a lot of different strategy you're going to play a fist draft in B3 and B5 so it's going
33:45
to be rough so here's kind of where the standings ultimately get decided you can see it's matches one um that's Series
33:52
wins then games then head-to-head uh and then the game time now it is possible
33:57
that we'll have tiebreakers if we do they'll be on Sunday so on Sunday we have match 25 so Sunday is only
34:03
scheduled to have one day or one match that day but I think given the standings there's a pretty good chance there will
34:08
be some teams that actually do end up having to either tie break for that fifth or final spot or potentially even
34:14
teams that have to tie break for standings yeah I'm expecting at least two games of tiebreaker cuz it's going
34:20
to be really interesting in who knows Sunday only has one series set up but it might be just a normal day of lck for us
34:27
5 to six matches potentially here are the group standings for the winning group so far with group Elder D plus Kia
34:33
has already locked up playoffs with Gen DRX and KT fighting for those top three
34:38
the final two out of the top three slots as well really interesting for geni they're not locked in yet because if KT
34:45
wins their match 20-0 and they lose their final match to Bro two- or it's actually not them who's facing off
34:50
against bro it's T1 they're facing but if they lose to t120 like they lost to bro um then
34:56
they'll be at 3-2 with a plus two score line as well now on the opposite side for group Baron it's more about the
35:02
teams on the bottom where bro dnf and bnk FX trying to find their way on up
35:09
bnk FX easiest match of them all on paper against Nong Jim and the Bros have
35:14
the hardest Road against D plus Kia here with did yeah but bro won against ji right and it's again uh lck cup you can
35:22
never expect something like a DK undefeated win in lck cup no I don't
35:28
think that's possible and also let's say it just goes that uh we expected like
35:33
let's say DK win against uh bro then bfx is high chance they get a win against
35:39
dong shim so it's going to be really interesting to see that y all right now with all of those things broken down by
35:44
group here's the full graphic in terms of play in standings and this is how it
35:50
will be uh decided as you could see D+ gen and T1 all sitting on top a top high
35:57
for second there but again the baron group teams cannot Place higher than I
36:03
guess it would be fifth because they are on the losing side so basically to to
36:09
simplify this this is all teams combined into one standings essentially so you're
36:14
competing within your group but also against teams on the other group to determine what that seed is going to be when we get to the playin and playoffs
36:21
so your record every game does matter a lot here so really important to see
36:26
what's going to happen really excited to see what's happen the most important match of all of course is that bnk match up because if they lose then we already
36:33
know who's eliminated yeah and for T1 and Hana life they're battling up against KT and DRX for the top spots for
36:41
the playin so everywhere up and down this week all the matches matter let's take a look at the patch notes because
36:48
we're undergoing 25. S12 love love the new patch naming
36:53
system by the way we got some changes here Feats of Strength and oton I mean we already talked about it first blood
36:59
is too much and they changed it to three kills and now atakan kind of got nerfed
37:04
you cannot really risk it with alakan otherwise you're going to give up a lot of Golds to enemy team and also gives
37:10
them a chance to bounce back so I think there's a lot to think about uh in terms
37:15
of uh rotation and strategy yeah the Roses got nerfed a little bit um but
37:21
specifically in terms of that withdrawal the false life the gold that you get from killing the players who res is
37:27
double so those kind suicide missions we've seen kind of bombing for inhibitor turret for example the risk of that is
37:33
so much higher also securing Aon then getting wiped is going to be at a much higher cost than it used to be so here's
37:39
some interesting changes that we have to Champions um for me the one that's most interesting actually is the Yumi changes
37:45
cuz Yi's AP ratios are going way up like when the devs were talking about they like yeah she's kind of not in a good
37:51
place we're going to buff for a little bit but you start looking at those numbers the passive AP ratio um I think
37:57
you is definitely viable especially in Fearless draft yeah and also I really want to point out the smolder as well in
38:03
L they already played this patch last week so a G2 play Moulder and they gave up old objectives like akaka Nasher
38:10
Elder but it didn't matter at all they just had fat smolder on caps and they
38:16
won against it so I think it's going to be uh popping off in lck cup as well
38:21
yeah we've got to see some Victor as well be a priority pick it gets nerfed and Mel still uh not enabled yet here in
38:28
LC so the big smolder change is the iie of course so it's an ie change kind of
38:33
because it affects molder now on this que um but some of the big changes we have here are the tank shred so some
38:39
cost increases to kind of make this a little bit more fair but still I mean the numbers here for armor pen for both
38:45
Lord Doms and Mortal reminder are pretty huge 5 extra per so you're going to have a lot better of a time getting through
38:51
those tanks it's been something that ad Carry has been complaining about I think in Pro and outside of pro so those some big changes un's a getting buffed as
38:58
well cuz people weren't really picking it in the early game I mean personally I think I feel like 80 carries are already
39:03
broken at this patch because you're already getting shredded you know so I mean maybe it's going to be too much but
39:10
I really like to see that as yeah well we'll see I mean Mages went down on the bottom side of the map it was something that teams were practicing you see the
39:17
ad carry pool being focused heavily in a lot of these drafts we'll see if it continues here with some of those
39:22
changes uh despite some of those changes we've had some standout players in the bottom side of the map and across all of
39:29
the roles here are the player of the matches based on the roles and how many times I've been able to do it shout outs
39:34
to bdd UK Cal owner and Lucid foru no where is support man it's R it's R
39:42
bringing me back like P's man like where is support uh I'm really happy to see UK
39:47
getting credit though um representing DRX in this list uh team that went 3-1
39:52
so far in the group battle I think a record that people weren't expecting you can see top just not having the impct
39:58
this season it's more focused on the mid and jungle right now mid jungle Synergy really important moving into this year
40:03
you have better mid jungle man it's easier yeah that's what it is kingan able to get it done there for Nong shim
40:09
and representing all the tops and speaking of those pom some of them went to some of these players these Stand Out
40:15
plays from the substitutes that have had the opportunity to step on in lazy feel obviously the earliest one for DRX hype
40:22
and Bulls switching some time smash has had his opportunity as well uh and pan
40:27
had the opportunity to get in who stood out to you from some of the substitutes in the lck cup to me it's the two 8
40:32
carries hype and smash right smash having an incredible record for player who's so new um and hype also making
40:38
such an impact in Bros wins um over bull who did take those two unfortunate losses I think La feel is hype in his
40:44
own right you know he's a Vietnamese player here playing in the lck cup but I have been very impressed with hype and smash they've been very consistent it's
40:51
part of why I'm leaning towards T1 uh in that upcoming geni match as well yeah uh and also I'm curious that if team is
40:58
going to bring up the substitutes in B5 like especially because uh it can happen
41:03
in fees like a real sports like after like game three if the champion pools are gone then you can actually bring in
41:10
the player and you can change the mood the environment itself so I think it's going to be like one of point that if
41:16
team has great substitude then you can bring in a new new environment new air yeah one of the coolest Parts about lck
41:23
cup the lower risk uh Stakes for teams to bring players on in and getting to see that in week two has been very very
41:30
awesome something we've seen throughout the lck cup a change in how we dive the turrets because of what has happened to
41:36
turrets in that 25. s1.1 patch where uh you're getting hit
41:42
by the turret a lot harder and it doesn't cool off as long yeah so they hit harder and the heat duration is 2
41:48
seconds longer so often times that 2 seconds if you mess up the dive initially might be enough time for the
41:54
defender under the turret to actually clear the wave out or or you know get their skills back so that's a big problem and the turret juggle of the
42:01
aggro is so important if you mess it up just one extra turret shot the enemy top laner in most cases is likely going to
42:07
get a kill back at least yeah and I think strategy kind of got changed like when you compare the dive situation uh I
42:15
think before uh your support was always on top to protect your top laner right but nowadays after that change I don't
42:22
think many supports are actually moving towards Top Lane to to help his Top Lane because you can actually outplay them
42:29
one versus three cuz turret is really stronger so I think that's one of the
42:34
strategy change uh from this turret change but also they really kind of Be
42:40
Clever about the dive as well you can actually just dive once and then after 5
42:45
Seconds you could redive cuz they got nothing you could see it on the replay as well ja use all the Summoner spells
42:52
and you could actually redive after that yeah it seems like Dives are a little bit more coordin ated and uh a new thing
42:59
that teams have to figure out which is something that felt so so solved in the last year's patch and speaking of
43:04
solving things it's time everyone what oh doing the pose oh no so
43:14
yeah part of the show for me every time I'm on the why cuz I don't know what
43:19
you're going to throw at me next and you've been throwing lore questions out recently and that's not my forte because
43:25
we're in noxis it's season of so yes we are Wolf's looking around to
43:30
try trying to see if there's there's any help on the wall uh any hints we we've
43:36
got yet another moderate lore question but has to do with way more gameplay now
43:41
we do have a pro player on our desk and I asked him what his favorite site was
43:46
for stats and he said games of Legends so this is pulled directly from games of Legends what did is played 219
43:52
professional matches as a pro player how many times did he play a champion from
43:57
noxus was it A3 B10 or c16 219 games um
44:05
I'm going to go 16 I feel like there's a lot of noxus Champions I mean although he's a support player though there's not
44:11
many nox support though but but listen listen you need to know that I I play so many weird support because I was I'm
44:17
going b i I was in eucs right okay he's making me go B I'm yeah right but you know what like all I remember from my
44:23
career is that Tom kenin Brown and alar so I don't remember our Champions cuz my
44:30
brain is full of tank Champions now I'm 10 okay I'm going to go with a cuz I'm
44:37
I'm kind of defensive so the final answers final answers Yeah final answer a well dude's right he played a lot of
44:43
Tom but the true answer is actually a he's played One champion from noxus wait
44:51
really you could have played Swain you could have played Elise you could have played uh bo who am I missing uh Sion
44:58
you only played re three times wait really at the supports I thought he
45:04
played C support like four times or something that's why I retired I guess only play oh my God this player man the
45:11
champion PO is okay I like how at least you made it somewhat Ro more gameplay related like there was a bit of a
45:17
crossover there chat did you get it right let us know chat if you got it right only three times out of 219 games
45:24
that's actually wild I mean I think if my my fans would get it cuz they they know all right time to move on it's time
45:30
to move to players that know what Champions they've played because they play them to take the gold it's the Udi
45:36
Bank gold King again last year's rainning gold King was aiming but this
45:41
time it's another bot laner it's head hunter hype of bro he gets himself the
45:47
gold king after the victory over geni yeah that's huge I didn't expect hype to
45:53
get the gold King but I guess that is actually from the geni game I guess yeah
45:59
I mean he ended up playing uh the kaisa and getting over 10 kills if I remember correctly so I think that's a big part
46:05
of it um and this goes back to the discussion we were having about this guy earlier in the show about how he's just
46:10
made such a big impact in Bros wi so when he set up for Success he's really aggressive and uh he turns a small gold
46:17
lead into a massive one 17,000 gold per game on average so
46:22
pretty impressive uh for the Bro player you don't see bro players getting the these Awards too often but hype man he's
46:28
changing the narrative wait we got two Gold Kings in like ad carries only right
46:33
yes I told you ad carries are broken okay all right all right the W did's ad8 carry Slanders going too too far let's
46:40
take a look at the schedule for this final week of the group battle as it all kicks off today with the DN freaks up
46:47
against KT then Han life Esports against DRX then on Saturday it's a huge huge
46:53
day T1 versus gen G and Brion taking on undefeated D plus Kia and then on Sunday
46:59
it's the tiebreakers which is that empty space there on the bottom plus the very very important match up between bnk FX
47:06
and Nong shim you guys selected what as your important one uh Saturday yeah sat
47:12
Saturday for sure like T1 geni is super hype I actually officially predicted T1 I thought it was going to be in the
47:18
majority just given Jeni's current form and T1 having a little bit more flexibility um but it's actually me you
47:24
and and Deon the only people who predicted that were on this desk right now yeah that is true but also you have
47:30
to think about the DK versus bro as well uh as I mentioned I don't think undefeated team can like possibility is
47:38
really low in lck cup a lot of things happening and also Bros got the mood as
47:44
well so I feel like bro can actually win against DK I I I did predict bro but
47:49
wolf brought up a very good point I went 5 for the baron group who destroyed in
47:55
the group battle also you need to remember that like Deon actually like didn't pick up bro and bro got the huge
48:02
win last week right and now he's going to RN bro because he's trying to be a
48:07
fake bro pan for now yeah he's got his green shirt on and everything he's cosplaying what's going on Deon no way
48:15
uh I think I think it's going to be a good week of matches though for real um that that Saturday we have seen some
48:21
upsets some disappointed casters you know no no bro levers over there not in
48:26
the arena chronicler a known bro atie over there see he
48:33
knows um yeah I I think it's going to be a good week of matches I think the exciting storyline for B and K that we
48:39
have at the very end of the week as well is really awesome because that really decides a lot of those tie Breakers so we save kind of the best for last let's
48:46
close here with the final thoughts on our first match of the day uh the DN Automotive freaks up against KT uh
48:52
flashes for D Freaks and looking for consistency for KT what jumps out at you as the key Point here I I think for DM
49:01
freaks that I was really high on them after week one I think they have really good game plans their drafts have been a
49:06
little bit eclectic but it's the early to mid game where they've had some really good strategies that could push them over the line here if they're going
49:12
to win this series it has to be clean early mid yeah and also dnf looks really great but at the same time KT looks a
49:19
little bit off cuz bdd is trying his best but other teammates I'm not sure so
49:24
they have to really step up if they want really want to get this all right huge huge matches throughout the week and it
49:29
all kicks off with this first one the DN freaks up against KT rollster coming to
49:35
you lck cup week number three final match at start right now
49:46
[Applause] [Music]
50:00
[Music]
50:15
[Music]
50:26
w [Music]
50:55
I
51:02
K KT hello and welcome to the lck cup we
51:10
are back here for 2025 I am curse Valdez and with me is chronicler the Caster
51:16
cursor and we're here for a great first match and maybe a great second match as well depending on how youal plays and uh
51:24
it's you know it's down to the wire here at the lck Cup group Elder has secured their spot as the number one group and
51:30
everybody on the side of group Baron is trying to avoid that 10th Place spot this is what feels like a must-win for
51:37
dnf in particular KT their ranking not great but they're still decently Ahad of
51:42
know ship and more importantly they're in the winning group group Elder has secured the win with their 13 wins so
51:49
they're just living the good life there's no way for them to get eliminated whereas for DN freaks if they
51:56
lose here today and bnk gets I want to say semi upset against D shim because I
52:02
feel like both those teams have already struggled but it's within realm of possibility that bnk gets that win it
52:08
could spell the demise as indeed a very high stake match up here because what KT
52:15
can get is an opportunity to get a round to secure which means you are in the double elimination part of the bracket
52:21
yeah you want to avoid play-ins I I I think in general but um you know in
52:27
their current spot they can't quite do that so as you mentioned you want to be in that round two you want to play in
52:32
the best of fives you want to have kind of an easier chance um and if not then
52:38
bro secures the play in round one so bro will be making it into playin uh if that
52:44
does happen so will be pretty interesting a lot of uh stakes from many different teams here as the perfect
52:50
player Emperor bdd receives high praises by all in the last match can he do it
52:56
again today against the returning Bulldog I'd say almost definitely yes
53:01
yes and I'm happy Bulldog is back uh pan lost against chovi so obviously yeah
53:07
can't believe I can't believe he would do that that's I mean chovi of all players never happens to anyone ever uh
53:14
but jokes aside I think seeing Bulldog back is definitely a good going up against BD though neither of these teams
53:21
have had all five players look good at the same time but 4kt the players that
53:27
have which are K uh bdd and cuz they have looked insane and that's what I think is for
53:34
many people the reason to predict cuz I'm pretty sure was uh like 60 70% favor for KT is just that mid jungle Duo
53:40
that's where all the P are and that's where KT is at their strongest yeah on the side of the DM freaks you know
53:47
Berserker had his days we seen Bulldog sometimes popping off I think that doooo
53:53
as always is sometimes good but but unfortunately he's been more so not so
53:59
great a little bit less consistent this year so far hoping he can get back on the bandwagon with the team really want
54:05
to because 2023 2022 dooo was incredible and we just haven't really seen that
54:11
form thus far as a love Kirby so they combined HZ and bdd and
54:17
they which is how you say Kirby in Korean kobby that's amazing I'm never
54:23
that's that's going to be you're going to get sick of that telling you in advance uh Kirby for Life the Kirby Duo
54:29
cuz and bdd uh that sign said they'll they'll get it done for the team and
54:35
they they they probably will they will because even though bulldog and poik I
54:41
don't poik has been up and down because his piosik that's just what he's always done Bulldog somewhat similar even when
54:47
these two players are playing well I don't think mid jungle 2v2 is ever their strength I think if you look at a
54:52
combination like most notably at the current meta show and Lucid comes to mind but even pan and chovi back when
54:59
they were playing together it's the 2v2 that can make many of these matches feel unplayable in particular with how more
55:04
important objectives are than they were previously you really need to be sharp in those skirmishes as a bull mom always
55:13
happy to support happy that I imagine her son is also back in the roster and that's what Dian freaks is going to have
55:19
to show her today because I trust Berserker in life I think that they've been playing pretty well Berserker in particular but just an 80 carrier alone
55:26
is not really going to do it versus a mid jungle deal that has been on absolute fire so you might be curious
55:33
what this this is this says uh you know bdd better than food or or or you know
55:42
basically they'll take bdd overe eating and I think that if you are a KT fan as
55:49
you can tell by the fan signs they're kind of all in you know they're like well our bottom Lane it's not very good
55:56
it's kind of sucking right now actually um our our top is you know sometimes good if he plays Renekton bdd please
56:03
carry us and he did alongside of cuz there was that game where they were both like deathless and then everybody else
56:09
had like five deaths and they won on Ari and Wukong it just kind of feels like there
56:14
is some heavy carrying going on for KT one can only hope at some point we get DRX versus KT and then it's whoever
56:21
which mid laner can carry the hardest cuz ukel has also been trying his very dark DRX is 3 in one at the moment by
56:28
the way so they're higher up you mean UK is three and one 3 in one yeah which is
56:34
kind of mind-blowing in and of itself and for dock Dum shouldn't come as a surprise I think perfect is continuing
56:40
with the struggles that we saw him in summer last year but wey is unfortunately uh I think a big surprise
56:47
in a negative fashion and there is plenty of time to correct course support is one of those roles where if you're a
56:53
little bit too eager you will just die like 10 times we've SE with manyas many engag champs especially compared Barrel
57:01
just any match really but given how huk and hyp have been performing although to
57:07
be fair huk also has that sub way as escapades uh we need to see him step up because if dockum and way can't match
57:14
the power of berserker and life I think cous and bdd are going to have a hard time carrying this one this talking about the draft we are
57:21
here on the new patch will be interesting to see if we see anything uh new the air ban and the Yon ban those
57:27
are targeted against bdd but yon is very good the Alo ban as well the scarner and
57:32
the kist I mean it is what it is right that's that's just kind of the meta at the moment yeah triple bdd bands the man
57:40
has a pretty big champion pool we'll see if he's willing to bring out some of his
57:46
other iconic Champions uh not Corky hopefully but things like Zoey come to
57:53
mind it was exceptional at that has also loved to play vager and there is a lot of dive style compositions going on DN
58:00
freaks in particular like it because Berserker has gravitated so heavily towards the kaisa so a late rotation
58:06
vagar pick I think can actually do a lot of heavy lifting here now B builds have been the topic of mania conversation but
58:13
his gameplay generally is where it needs to be in particular he has been recently Sani is open that is one of cuz's
58:21
absolute favorit would go Bell with the ambessa as well not going for DJ first pick though which has been extremely
58:28
high priority here perfect instead going for the more aggressive setup and this
58:33
what make sense from a utility point of view and then probably going to Pivot towards the Sani here on the third rotation as Shani is a combo that has
58:40
been very popular for a long time pretty am to CC and engage potential yeah and you already know that the vi is going
58:46
over to Pik we've been saw him on camera nodding yes pick me the vi you know seems very obvious as this will be TOA
58:54
VI if they do lock this one in a a very strong combo it doesn't quite have the
58:59
range of REI but the combo burst potential of toi is just insane so
59:07
obviously a very strong duo in its own right and what are they going to pick along side of this do pick top at this
59:14
point in time try to match the ambessa with a rumble or a Jace which seems to be the next two couple of tier list
59:20
picks they will go for the rumble does mean the top side is pretty magic damage heavy here for the the INF
59:27
freaks but nothing to worry about too much tiia not quite as lethal
59:32
particularly at six as the ARA AR combo as you point out also doesn't have as much backline
59:39
dive I I do think panthan right now is in a really strong spot picking him into
59:45
tiia though can definitely be somewhat of risk and the Tia also feels amazing into the Essa right that's something
59:51
you're always going to be happy about like VI with the rumble as well Wonder what the bands are going to be here I
59:58
wouldn't mind a ra ban here for KT because most likely
1:00:03
you're looking to pick up Brum here on four they're already going very heavy for a more aggressive composition again
1:00:10
I think the chances that they lock in kaisar basically 100% have to see what else is going to
1:00:18
get banned away or maybe Ezreal comes to mind as well cuz he can just kind of negate a lot of laning
1:00:23
pressure Ari makes sense yeah just uh
1:00:28
it's just five bdd banss yeah you give them an opportunity to ban out bdd even more uh I I think they're going to take
1:00:35
that and run with it question is what would be ban number five or do you take
1:00:42
away the Braum at this point I'm like looking at
1:00:49
what like Swain vagar comes to mind again anything that is heavy a playing
1:00:55
it in though there is good setup already with that pantheion I mean thetically you can
1:01:03
even Flex it oh okay boy love that that's so cool I mean
1:01:10
they already have so much lockd down and now you've got a point and click another one on top of the
1:01:17
pantheon and it's just Corky it's just Corky Berserker yeah somewhere showmaker
1:01:23
is salivating seeing that TF is is back and it makes sense as you point out the
1:01:29
Merks value is going to feel great but if you buy a lot of Merks then the rest of the ad damage is going to hit even
1:01:36
harder rakan do like it with the F do like it with the rumble but rakan Corky
1:01:41
as a lane is not something that I'm feeling great about there is going to be an incredible amount of lockdown
1:01:47
available here way could be looking towards the poppy here has that I think varying
1:01:54
performances I remember a lot of moments from him and a lot of moments that were maybe nut this is really going all in on
1:02:01
trying to punish the lane will leave you with not as much engage potential but
1:02:08
given the relatively short range for most people on the en freaks I do think that the Rada is going to get a lot of
1:02:15
value and again you are going to absolutely Pummel a 2v2 here with that Ash Rada combo so
1:02:21
it might force a swap out from thean freaks we'll see if they can preempt that but that mid jungle Duo I know that
1:02:28
t VI is pretty solid but into Pantheon and TF that's that's going to
1:02:34
be a a tough one whoever gets ahe early as well is going to have insane pressure in the side Lanes with the double
1:02:40
globals for KT and then even with that toia Bulldog can quickly roam to sides as well yeah you got Ash Arrow as well
1:02:47
to kind of hop in there if you've got something Brewing on the other side of the map if the ash is in the middle and
1:02:55
it it it's it's going to be a pretty fun one I I don't think we've seen this aggressive of a duo with the TF and the
1:03:02
pantheon you know I was thinking about the the draft and I'm saying okay you're Banning out five Champions against bdd
1:03:08
but we already talked about how deep his champion pool is he's like okay cool story he wasted all these bands and now
1:03:13
we're going to get TF Pantheon yeah and I think you're sad about that at all yeah and Bessa as well
1:03:20
one of the strongest champion at the moment we'll see if Dean freaks can fight back against his mid jungle 2v2
1:03:25
that is the question as it looks like we are ready to hop onto the rift for game number one let's do
1:03:31
[Music]
1:03:47
it here we go game number one and the Le level ones have always been something
1:03:54
that the teams have on for especially the team that has TF and Pantheon uh and Ash you're going to be
1:04:01
looking to get this going and so oo yeah I wonder what build bdd is going to go for as well it's gone
1:04:08
for electrocute which is about to be buffed on the next patch cuz there are a
1:04:14
ton of different styles you can go on the TF you can go for more utility oriented builds can go for just straight
1:04:19
up burst burst is going to feel good want to try and go heavy on the AP as well you have so much 80 damage yeah so
1:04:26
that mid jungle 2v2 particularly with the changes to tiia which at this point
1:04:32
are already a while back but generally unless it's on bdd specifically you will
1:04:38
have a hard time 100 to zeroing someone within that combo and T or uh the
1:04:43
pantheon really isn't that great of a Target because of his e if you throw too much upfront damage into him when he has
1:04:50
the opportunity to go for an e if you don't hit like a flash Q or something catch him off guard actually getting enough Dam take down cuz is going to be
1:04:57
quite tough as we do have cuz starting in the in the jungle and yeah thean
1:05:02
freaks choosing to just handshake this Lane I don't think is going to feel very good they do know that cuz is on the red
1:05:09
at the moment that is spotted so we see pososi immediately crossing over but that's not going to change the situation
1:05:16
about how rough this bot Lane match up is and they're also on the weak side of the map
1:05:22
yeah so they just elect as you mentioned [Music]
1:05:27
to it's it's not even really a handshape because what they get instead is just a pretty basic okay nice going to get that
1:05:34
how many of the little guys are they going to get looks like 42 gold wins to Berserker and Noel three for cuz yeah so
1:05:41
he is kind of in an awkward spot this going to feel good at least nicely done there by Berserker and life
1:05:48
Berserker as a result also hits level two but it's you know it's a it's a
1:05:53
small win still stuck in this Lane yeah handshake comes in life you know he can
1:06:00
heal a little bit but he's still level raon or level raan level one raan pots
1:06:06
are already gone yeah the pots ticking there you can see there's one uh going
1:06:12
on the other side and now what you get is Dudu in a one V one against perfect who's playing ambessa and really doesn't
1:06:19
care because he's Zamba the electrocute damage you see does a little bit there
1:06:26
going to be doing a bit more on the next patch but bdd is still feeling pretty
1:06:31
good about that lane Here Comes Pantheon cuz level three Guardian is available
1:06:37
life I imagine is the target here cuz his passive stacked as well so we'll have the empowered OS on W he comes in
1:06:44
they're still going to go for it the knockup goes in on the C he's tanking the turret he's definitely going down the first Blood goes to corki and they
1:06:52
do take down the raan and you know with our new warfare
1:06:57
feeds of strength it's not going to mean that okay dnf just win because they got the kill 1 second ahead it's just going
1:07:04
to be one for one as we work towards getting the first three kills and now Berserker is in a rough spot don't think
1:07:10
that he is at threat of dying also level four already has the red buff available so thean freaks take that I'd say really
1:07:18
nicely done there by life to go for the W to ensure that CZ doesn't just get out
1:07:24
and now they're looking for C dive perfect is relatively low this is a big wave and there was no one to help him he
1:07:30
knows but I does have his flash he's trying to Dash and dash there's the flash to get
1:07:37
away very nicely handled by Perfect the pressure still going to work you know it
1:07:43
denies him a big wave up on the top side and at the same time though it is
1:07:49
going to mean that life still level two has to kind of run back to his Lane and try to hit that very important level
1:07:54
three yeah two levels down is life so that Ro
1:08:01
doesn't work out outside of denying the wave don't get the kill as we take
1:08:07
another look here yeah Guardians up the heals used preemptively and then cuz going in with the w there
1:08:14
uh they do have the damage to take down life but I do think that it was pretty optimistic from the beginning especially
1:08:20
cuz he wasn't level four extra level in your que maybe you get the opportunity to get that damage out and then fly out
1:08:26
definitely think he should have as he did held his flash though because if he flashes I'm pretty sure Berserker still
1:08:31
gets him after he takes the initial two turret shots does mean that the kills
1:08:36
are Trad eely but do note we have another swap coming in as the grubs are
1:08:41
coming up shortly and yeah this feels so much better the Warfare going to free kills yeah it makes sense I'm happy that
1:08:50
it only took a single patch cuz this does feel like there is actually Stakes there's a bit of back and forth like
1:08:56
there is with the rest of the Feats yeah uh we still have first Tower
1:09:02
I I don't think you can really do a thing where you've got like first three towers yeah but it kind of means that
1:09:09
sometimes if you win the grub fights and you get like a rift Aral then you can get the first Tower so there's still that kind of
1:09:15
snowballing in that but yeah I'm not really sure there's a good change for
1:09:21
that like I said you're not going to make it like first three towers that would just kind of be ridiculous
1:09:26
and take forever so at the moment feels pretty good and as you mentioned they
1:09:33
did elect to go for the Swap and here's bulldog and the stun does come in even
1:09:38
though the knockup is there as how do you get away from this you just got to try to flash as okay Destiny going to be
1:09:44
used in the Top Lane he's got a yellow card out here a bit of extra damage on aosi who will flash away just by the
1:09:51
threat of the TF big thing here is that PDD in one Fell Swoop gets the flash out
1:09:57
of bulldog invalidates them to go and contest the grubs even with just that
1:10:03
and then also tp's top gets the flash from piosik and this is exactly what we're talking about the 2v2 for both of
1:10:11
these two teams is lethal but for KT both have setup you can either gold card or you can start with the w whereas for
1:10:18
DN freaks Bulldog by himself can't really do too much does get taken down
1:10:24
low and unable uh does get the shove in but BD was able to catch most of that
1:10:30
wave anyway so he's not going to be too bothered and that the grubs going fully importantly tikt meaning that they are
1:10:36
now one in free for those objectives as well yeah remember you were talking about the Sid Lane and how you could put
1:10:42
on some pressure well KT already has three grubs they have immense pressure
1:10:47
uh with this composition they could look to take six grubs even if they have to give a dragon over or even a turret over
1:10:54
you can say okay well now we've got six and now we can really try to make some big pushes happen in a side lane do see
1:11:01
the Roa being worked towards here for bdd so maybe a little bit of uh you know
1:11:08
just a a backup plan in case he is the main target that is looking to get blown up yeah I don't mind Roa but I do feel
1:11:15
like going for electrocute with Roa you know I think until Spellbook still had a a good amount of potential
1:11:22
value there so right now Drake is being taken that's two
1:11:28
objectives coming through here for KT everything looking good so far yeah kind
1:11:34
of getting everything perfect does not have his flash though and he's certainly being challenged by Dudu as the a are
1:11:41
coming in but it's not quite enough to take down ambessa as she is just built
1:11:47
different and is a new Champion um so she's just going to run away and doesn't
1:11:55
even have to flash couldn't anyway obviously Dudu is putting on a lot of pressure there and perfect doesn't have
1:12:01
his TP either so it's going to make it pretty awkward potentially up on the top side but again perfect is ambessa can
1:12:09
piosik make something of this as here comes the ulton in the damage should be enough but dudo taking a ton of damage
1:12:16
himself Bulldog as well making his way up even life was here for the potential fourman dive if they needed it but they
1:12:22
will get the kill yeah this time around perfect does go down and you you can't
1:12:28
really fold him obviously the earlier trade and him being low is his fault as oh we dropping in h yeah I mean this is
1:12:35
just Pantheon this is just cuz until bdd lands his Destiny but D already next to
1:12:41
the turret going to hit life actually pretty big deal KT invests two Global
1:12:46
ultimates there both of these are on a long cool down panels like I think close to 2 minutes uh I think even longer
1:12:53
initially and so happened there is Berserker shoves in bot wave D and freaks not only get off the top side
1:13:01
gank then get out with their lives but K also invest a lot bot wave isn't being
1:13:07
catched uh or caught up until the point where perfect actually makes it back to that lane so KT definitely not able to
1:13:14
get the most out of the play there and it feels like DN freaks actually been able to retake Tempo pretty nicely
1:13:21
here we'll see if they can actually turn it into an objective as well that's obviously going to be the big test as the grubs are coming up in about 50
1:13:30
seconds yeah I mean you talked about all cool Downs uh bulldog and Kosik should
1:13:35
have theirs first I do wonder if they'll get theirs I think the vi definitely will the wall a little bit less crucial
1:13:43
as long as uh Bulldog's just hanging around the mid lane so just fine for now they've also got that TP on Dudu and
1:13:50
might just end up being a grub trade here unless KT really wants to just kind of run at in and try to make a play for
1:13:56
it maybe at least get one of the grubs to steal it away yeah what was cute
1:14:01
there as well was that as cuz was coming in he actually had the ranada bail out on him so just a little bit extra power
1:14:08
there in his initial plays yeah just kind of face checking it uh not wanting to jump over the Rocks was
1:14:16
Cuzo BD doesn't flash that he dies W was primed as well and that's now no sums on
1:14:22
the mid laner for KT and the vision control is amazing here for the DN
1:14:27
freaks as well we'll see if KT feel confident enough to try and contest they
1:14:32
really want to get to the grubs do have pry in top way moving up but I think this is
1:14:39
not really the setup that you're looking for bdd now has R done I think also finished his boots just now Swifty's at
1:14:47
the ready I think B Lucidity boots at first and was like no I need to be faster got to go fast we do see cuz
1:14:55
nearby but the setup here much better for the DM freaks cuz would love to just kind of stroll in and smite one away and
1:15:04
now the rest of the team coming in but there is the knockback cuz getting pretty low but now the crunch coming in
1:15:09
from kttp behind this one that's Rumble and they committed big time to this this
1:15:14
Pantheon is just so dead you're not getting away as the bail out he is not able to do anything duck left alone on
1:15:20
the bottom side of the fight as rocks are flying bdd as well to get knocked up but I don't think he
1:15:27
cares I'm not sure they have enough damage between these two especially with the ash nearby but still it's a big win
1:15:33
for the side of the DN freaks as they've got push on top side as well win the
1:15:39
Skirmish get the grubs all they give up is some plates toward the B side of the
1:15:44
map but with the assist Dudu is still going to come out very far ahead gets the top wave crash as well and and KT
1:15:50
cuz I don't know what that was uh just gets knocked back doesn't uses e for the initial burst of damage so he's
1:15:56
basically already extremely low might be on cool down because he does use it so
1:16:02
uh the disaster has already happened here but then crucially his e doesn't actually account
1:16:08
which makes sense cuz I didn't know where dudo was until it was already too late for dudo coming in so he just roasts him and then at this point uh
1:16:16
obviously you're not going to invest the teleport so you're just kind of trying desperately to get anything out of it lot of members get out with their
1:16:23
lives but the freaks in these team fights so far looking a lot better we
1:16:28
gave cuz a lot of Praise but the panan play does far does feel like it leav something to be desired yeah also we've
1:16:35
seen so many players just kind of not respect not having Vision in the banana brush uh over there by the rift pit as
1:16:43
Destiny is going to come in I think he tried to use a wall and that's just going to be cancelled Bulldog will just
1:16:49
be executed this is what we expected out of this Duo press your buttons and get kills but
1:16:56
as you mentioned still maybe just one kill still a thing still good might if
1:17:02
they get the dragon here that would actually be huge we'll see looks like KT might try to go I don't think they can
1:17:09
get the turret plates are about to drop if perfect can stall even a little bit
1:17:14
here and they are able to get the third objective they're going to be feeling
1:17:19
good they lost Warfare though B turret goes down and here comes
1:17:25
an arrow from Duck just trying to help out the dragon goes down I think they got it they got the pat yeah so now
1:17:31
perfect I mean yeah he might go down here he is still ambessa he's dashing he's diving out of the way and dnf are
1:17:38
just left scratching their heads at the design as that's that is pretty hard to
1:17:44
do that they're still going to be able to push him away and get the turret but it feels like a consolation prize at
1:17:50
this point dnf still in the lead but they're down a couple of of leading gold
1:17:56
I should say they're they're down a couple of dragons they're down the Feats of Strength now so it will be interesting to see how this game does
1:18:01
play out from a relatively even position now it's a back and forth ales imagine
1:18:07
that yeah we haven't had that many of those so I I'm I for one welcome it what
1:18:13
I really really like there is again just a very clear Showcase of the power of these double globals Bulldog just up too
1:18:20
far in the lane even though he is able to get rid of bdd is always going to go down the moment that he gets CC doesn't
1:18:27
have his Archangel Shield nor his Merk Treads uh is building towards those as we can see and those Merk TRS are
1:18:32
actually as mentioned going to get a ton of value for KT or for uh for the DN freaks rather because both against the
1:18:40
arrow but against the pantheon and against the gold card it's all going to feel quite strong the fact that bdd gets
1:18:45
the kill is huge though because he is the sole AP Source looks to be building towards a shadow flame
1:18:53
next after to see what he ends up going could also still be a Zas which allows
1:18:59
him to go for plays that are a lot more aggressive yeah perfect did his job there in the top side play able to stall
1:19:05
clear the wave and then get out with his life which allowed his team to get the boots upgrade and the sandals
1:19:12
particularly the swifties swifties are crazy good so bdd going to be very happy with that like there are yeah I think by
1:19:19
far the best upgraded boot because the same reason why cloudo was op could just walk just just walk just walk just run I
1:19:26
mean at that point you're just kind of running perfect going in on this one not knowing the imminent danger that he is
1:19:31
in as the vial does come down does Dodge a bit of that but he's still going to be
1:19:37
taken down now Bulldog is in a pretty rough spot but here comes life and actually going to force the flash Away
1:19:43
by because they're not able to convert on the other side of the map as Berserker solo farming you got doooo
1:19:50
solo farming in the bottom Lane and that's been a lot of the story you know keep you going for these big plays and
1:19:57
not exactly working out and dnf picking up the scraps Elsewhere on the map yeah every time that they go for these
1:20:02
ultimates and they don't get a kill it's it's a really big investment uh the counter kill does end up working out as
1:20:09
perfect fortunately going in there using those dashes that could have been the Difference Maker doesn't tank too much
1:20:15
of the equalizer but it's still enough I think actually got the old off there to
1:20:20
not get hit but he already took way too much damage so didn't end up mattering too much unfortunately for him and then
1:20:26
we had cousin bdd go in but not quite having the damage as it looks like bdd
1:20:31
opting to go for the Lich Bane instead does make sense a lot of squishies on the enemy team and the movement speed
1:20:37
together with the swifties and ghost is going to go kind of crazy but he's not playing CH goth
1:20:43
chronicler no no you were showing me a build it was it it looked fun right I we get to see it at some point yeah uh
1:20:50
movement speed chog uh it's it's I mean he's got ghost flat you know got the
1:20:56
movement speed yeah uh all he needed was shelus really instead instead of I mean that that was the build in the past you
1:21:02
know like Shel is into like rapid fire Cannon and and lichbane and you're just
1:21:07
kind of flying around zooming there's that lpan finished so two items right
1:21:13
now on bdd he's actually doing decent damage TF isn't the most you know damage
1:21:19
heavy AP Source in the game obviously but at least as you mentioned he got a bit fed and he was able to at least sore
1:21:25
up that lacking it's good burst for his mostly which this comp is going to rely on burst anyway although we do have doam
1:21:32
also going for just straight up crit Ash with the wild arrows dragons are going to be a really
1:21:39
big deal though we haven't talked about this yet but it's hex stack Drake KT does have two and I actually think that that is where their best way into a win
1:21:47
for this game is because the skirmishes thus far have not been going their way I think that D and freaks have an incredible 5v5 composition and borrowing
1:21:55
any really big ultimates from we or KT's preferred method finding someone inside blowing them up the 5v5 should be
1:22:02
favored towards the INF freaks now mer done for free people both poik bulldog
1:22:08
and then light as well all have them available Berserker has also been looking good on corki which might
1:22:14
perhaps be the most impressive thing out of anything that we've witnessed so far imagine making corki look good uh I
1:22:21
think it was ruler right yes dened the penta on his Cory ruler notoriously not
1:22:28
that great otherwise against the DM freaks
1:22:34
yeah and the DM freaks are like wa that's pretty good maybe we should play that the takeway is yeah good back up
1:22:41
that corki pryo it's got a 7% win rate but you know we can fix him it's fine
1:22:46
heas was showing me in between uh before the series began the 7% corki win rate
1:22:53
one and 12 one and 12 and the one win is ji ruler the next closest is looking for
1:22:59
the pick but I don't think they're going to get it yeah that's more of like a just just
1:23:05
going to press R to see where they are Zone control yeah yeah zoning Al from the TF and with Rift Heralds DM freaks
1:23:14
are very much in control of the map right now KT The Equalizer is kind of oh
1:23:20
wow it did a lot more than I was expecting du to kind of taken up the turret though Here Comes Bulldog uh just blocking the rift
1:23:27
Heralds that's totally fine it wasn't getting another charge anyway but really the main take away from this is the
1:23:33
pressure and the fact that they should off of the back of this be able to get the dragon but they're not going for it
1:23:39
just yet KT really want this Dragon right like even if you're at a gold deficit if you ever in Opportunity where
1:23:45
hex soul is only a single Drake away you always going to be feeling good that's also equalizer used to no kill so I
1:23:53
actually think KT have the right idea can they execute though as piosik is in the pit and KT they're going to have to
1:24:00
pick a Target I mean it might just come down in a Smite fight like here comes dud he's pretty Fett he doesn't have
1:24:05
equalizer but he can roast everybody that's the engage from life and he gets knocked back as well duck does nothing
1:24:12
as they try to go for Bulldog but he's able to stay alive and dou will go the pantheon as well that is a free Drake
1:24:18
given over to the DM freaks plus a bonus couple of kills and dog Dum is the one
1:24:24
remember that can't go down first has to stay alive for this composition to have
1:24:30
the necessary damage and with him going down there really isn't enough bdd
1:24:36
doesn't join the fight until later on and you can see KT know that they have to go for this Drake but it's the setup
1:24:42
here life actually doing a wonderful job goes in finds the chain CC and then even
1:24:49
with the B it doesn't change anything because no one on DN freaks is even close to dying bulock looked like he
1:24:56
might but he's still with his Archangel Shield that's now verious Aon as well and I think DM freaks are about to bring
1:25:02
us to a game one Victory here because that is soulle point Deni that's Aon right yeah I know that
1:25:09
it's 200 gold now but wa yeah yeah it just means you can't really be
1:25:16
as as crazy yeah absolutely insane as a lot of teams have been I I think that
1:25:24
you know so you can use it to put on pressure you can still dive as long as it's a big cleaner and you know kind of
1:25:30
utilize it to pick up the baron but they didn't quite syn up the timers for doing that perfectly I don't
1:25:38
think they're going to care too much you know securing the objective 100% is much more important than getting perfect
1:25:43
timing on that um it's really about the SK difference over time like every
1:25:49
single team fight has gone the way of Dian Freaks and yeah there were a couple of picks that went to the TF and
1:25:54
Pantheon but they're not scaling out of control uh because is zero and three
1:26:00
duck just got Charmed and died without using his flash he got bailed out at least which didn't do anything and then
1:26:07
they just didn't really have the damage or the wherewithal to to fight that one as okay nice arrow is going to hit into
1:26:13
Berserker just going to go for the cleanse it just that's it it's just cleanse at least it hit him you know and
1:26:20
now they're going for cuz once again the combo does come in but that is Pantheon going to bait out the ranata
1:26:26
ultimate so # worth yeah I don't even give up any of their Buffs Dudu is still
1:26:33
happily pushing little wall to come in nice Flash from wayy as okay bdd even going
1:26:40
to flash in against the wall in the top of the map as we're going deep for this one at least the bailout barely comes
1:26:47
out at the end but he's not able to survive and of course with the revive coming in from the Aon dnf able to just
1:26:54
just go ahead and do this and uh yeah every every Tower is
1:27:00
falling everything is falling to the side of the DN freaks who are very far ahead at this point in
1:27:06
time and piosik and life are the big difference makers in this one it's the continuous engage of those two I was a
1:27:14
bit skeptical about this Recon the post laning phase they were completely fine
1:27:19
and it's that one two of Koshi diving in raan following up that has been a really
1:27:25
really big issue for KT and here as well bdd revive comes through wasn't really
1:27:31
going to be a big difference maker anyway and now even his gold lead is dwindling but we kind of knew the moment
1:27:38
that Aon was taken and even before the like I think the moment that I saw that Drake fight yeah the Drake fight was
1:27:44
the that was the de that was some highlight to territory I've ever seen ites yeah a little Noe to the space um I
1:27:52
am curious if Ash will ever be able to do anything you talked about the crit
1:27:57
build on the Ash and it it just feels like you know we talked a lot about TF and Pantheon versus uh tiia and V and
1:28:06
whoever gets ahead just feels so comfortable and good because you've got Leah to extend at least with her wall
1:28:12
we've seen that Bulldog multiple times he's not trying to wall people off he's just Walling to get close to where VI is
1:28:17
engaging so when VI is going deep he's able to go deep as well and then you just you're able to go insane mode
1:28:24
because nobody can get away from you bdd is also on the same level even though
1:28:29
like literally same experience as well B is actually slightly ahead of him even though bdd was the one with Roa just not
1:28:35
really coming together I think cuz his Pantheon play also not the most inspiring that we've
1:28:41
seen and now it's going to take a miracle and what I really like from DM
1:28:47
freaks the one way that I think you give KT a Sure Fire way back into this game is anyone overextending inside because
1:28:54
with the arrow and with the double Global that is still a way that you can do it oh cuz not again as the combo
1:29:00
comes in you talked about it this time it will go onto the pantheon and there's just no Escape as bit of damage is going
1:29:06
into Dudu but he's got sonas completed duck do desperate to do something in
1:29:11
this game but he'll be denied doing anything as Dudu even gets the kill onto him as he escapes at the same time just
1:29:19
the burn damage getting it done this game is done in dusted chronicler
1:29:25
I The Killing doodle would not have changed anything but I I still hope that it would happen just so K he would have
1:29:31
something the duct fans would have been a little bit happier maybe yeah well bdd at least got
1:29:36
the TP out so that's something yeah bdd unfortunately you
1:29:42
know how we talked before about he was in his promos and it was working out he is again in his promos but not not in a
1:29:48
good way as at this point KT so far behind that the freaks can go for any
1:29:53
engage make it work due to a really nice stopwatch there the rest of the team ready to bail them out the heal used
1:29:58
raan arriving in the nick of time and nothing that ready can be done
1:30:04
there for okt yeah it was a very close game until it wasn't uh you know we
1:30:10
talked about the compson at length and it really just comes down to whoever gets far enough ahead can just absolutely just Sledgehammer the other
1:30:18
team over and over and DN freaks have made that very clear to every that is
1:30:24
watching especially after that Drake fight they're like well now we just get to pum me over the head and there's not
1:30:29
really anything you get to do yeah there was what like two ultimate uh or two instances where
1:30:36
both bdd and cuz would use their not get anything like that's one of the things with global ultimates if they don't work
1:30:42
out and you're kind of even it just feels horrible because again if if you get into a 5v5 if you're DN Freaks and
1:30:49
relatively as we have seen I think their comp it's such a straightforward front to back you great engage great followup
1:30:55
a lot of AE damage as well with it's a Leah and the rumble and then we never really got to see an opportunity for KT
1:31:02
to try and you know turn that lead into anything else cuz the lead never really
1:31:08
materialized okay they're going in on the dooo they quickly realize their mistake as everybody tries to just run
1:31:14
away and they're all being burned down by The Equalizer which was excellently placed this should just be a straight up
1:31:21
Ace unless BD uh survive somehow doesn't matter the Nexus will fall Asos po
1:31:28
trying to extend into position for life to make the jump actually does do so and
1:31:34
bdd Will Survive uh but he won't be happy about it he's got a one-onone score line the rest of the team don't
1:31:40
look at those kdas as the DM freaks absolutely Crush KT in game one Yos
1:31:47
getting a little bit of highlight there his Vai combined with life and Berserker
1:31:52
looking good on again we keep going back to it because still might be the most impressive thing out of what we've seen
1:31:59
here today what we witnessed in the first games the INF freaks do not get
1:32:04
caught off guard by these globals you know Bulldog died what like once in the bottom Lane uh but then absorbed a ton
1:32:10
of other ganks as well and in the 5v5 it's the jungle support that look so on
1:32:16
point and you know the to the combination of Rada and panum was never
1:32:23
already going to work out but I'm just going back to that draft and I'm thinking what if we was on an engage Champion what if he could play with the
1:32:30
pantheon and what instead of trying to go for Lane which again didn't work out like bot Lane dive didn't work I think
1:32:36
cous on panion just wasn't really it I was excited to see it but it didn't really blow me away and this is just
1:32:44
yeah perfect also this pryo pick on the ambessa not able to get anything done
1:32:50
yeah I mean that's almost as much as as Recon um it it's it was rough for him I
1:32:57
mean his laning phase was just getting Dove over and over but yeah the ambessa not able to do anything it's on the that
1:33:03
if that happens if you get four men Dove multiple times your team should be getting stuff on the other end of the map and it just didn't happen didn't
1:33:10
happen and the DN freaks were able to crush them in game one we'll take a break and have the space we'll be right

1:39:48
the DN Automotive Freaks Come Out Swinging one Z over
1:39:53
after their draft wasn't able to come together welcome back to the space Deone alongside wadid and wolf and gentlemen
1:40:01
after a tumultuous start for corki it is now two that's right two and 12 two in a
1:40:09
row and the first win was against dnf
1:40:14
that's right it was ruler against Berserker Berserker says Ah I'm going to play that and he finds himself winning
1:40:20
in this one I so let's talk about this draft um we don't we don't do that many draft uh focuses here on the desk
1:40:26
anymore but I do want to talk about how KT rollster hyper indexed away from any sort of late game scaling and Power in
1:40:33
team fights and went into this super easy to execute combo where you basically two Global ults lock somebody
1:40:40
down and kill them and Snowball the game you get a vision control from this you snowball sides the rumble gets pushed
1:40:45
out it becomes easy to play you have the ash to the Cory as well so you should be able to get Lane advantages there right
1:40:51
but KT Bots the bottom Lane dive so that wi conon fell apart and then some of their Pantheon TF engages really just
1:40:58
didn't hit the mark there was some weird timings and KT was just constantly behind in Tempo this entire game this is
1:41:04
complet completely wrong because like oh my gosh listen the NF ban five bands on
1:41:09
mid lane right and then they they kind of played out their best Champs like
1:41:15
ambessa on the top and Ash on the Bol Lane but your ambassa is trying to escape your ulti with your ulti and also
1:41:21
your Ash ranada is not winning the ball Lane really hard and also your Pantheon with his UL he didn't get anything you
1:41:27
know so I think this is just completely wrong from the KT side like I we really cannot blame bdd uh for not carrying
1:41:35
this off because he already got five bands yeah and it felt like early on it was pretty difficult for KT to get
1:41:42
anything going when they Dove on the bottom side of the map uh the red buff went to Berserker didn't quite work out
1:41:49
there the Cs was equal for Berserker on cork against Ash like you said and now we did has a telestration for us to
1:41:56
break down yet another early game uh misc from KT yeah I mean uh you really
1:42:03
want to fight these GRS as a KT side right but they went for the top wave here and I think that was the issue
1:42:10
because you can see bdd having no ultimates no sums at all and also your Pantheon has nothing right so they
1:42:17
should have just give up this top wave and just go all around to midwave and group as four so they could actually
1:42:24
have a chance because look at their comp they have TF they have Ash and they have Pantheon which means that you can
1:42:30
actually lock down one target really easily but now uh instead of that just see what happens right now is like dnf
1:42:37
just grouped as four and then they just split KT completely and you can just roll the clip
1:42:43
here yeah I mean they shouldn't just go for the that top WB you know I think that was the issue like CU and bdd tried
1:42:51
to just walk in through the mid lane and then they they they just Tred to walk in S2 like this is just completely
1:42:58
wrong uh Choice by KT here I mean CL gets isolated obviously by the uh Tia
1:43:04
and doesn't have his e to actually block the damage has it here in a moment so uses it to try to mitigate some of this
1:43:10
from piosik on the engage but he's already so low and KT didn't have either those critical ultimates right the
1:43:16
pantheon or the TF still wanted to fight this they already have a three bleed the problem with making calls like this in a
1:43:22
game uh when you're really trying to snowball and if you fall behind at any point you lose control is that the risk
1:43:27
is so high and if you fail as they did it feels like the game is just out of your hands all you can do is look for
1:43:32
side picks which they failed later on and this moment is so critical because it gives a huge lead to the DM freaks
1:43:39
who then are able to take that Vision away make that combo so much less reliable I mean I mentioned so many
1:43:45
times that like you have to pre-plan the fights right they already knew that they have no Pantheon and TF ulti that means
1:43:51
they have to talk about how they want to enter the grops and this was not the situation that they they pre-plan for
1:43:58
the fight 219 games y'all that doesn't happen by accident make sure you're taking notes here when wiid is drawing
1:44:04
on the screen now this one needs no drawing this is how you're supposed to play out a composition like this a great
1:44:10
great flank by Dudu and the DN freaks cook KT and close their dreams of a game one win so here's the point that I was
1:44:17
thinking that maybe they should just give up the Drake the KT because they already got the two stacks on Drake and
1:44:23
they have uh some kind of free gos on the top side they could just get the first turret and just go for the another
1:44:30
gold but they instead of that they just choose to fight here and I thought this is kind of impossible to win that fight
1:44:36
yeah I think KT felt like okay this game is super DED we're we're two 3,000 gold behind they're probably calculating like
1:44:41
this isn't going to work we have to rush this Dragon because dud Do's bottom Lane and so maybe we can get this done fast
1:44:47
up but they don't have enough damage to rush the Drake down which gives enough time for that flank to come through from Dudu he doesn't have ultimate either so
1:44:53
I can see some of the ideas here for KT like oh maybe doesn't have but it's a really nice combo here set up from Life
1:44:58
the the rumble damage is immense so dudo even without his ultimate just does so much in this fight but remember there
1:45:05
was no ultimate for bdd once again so many of these really important fights he's not there he's stuck in the mid lane and it's divide and conquer once
1:45:12
again coming through from Dean freaks they were able to turn that fight on the dime if the ash was further ahead if
1:45:17
they had more damage if they could Rush that Dragon down I think it's a reasonable choice but they just felt priced into it because if they don't get
1:45:22
that soulle point to threaten further fights like there's just no way back into the game it was a lose lose situation yeah and going back to just
1:45:28
the very first game I think we saw DN Freaks and specifically Bulldog on TOA where you called him out saying hey
1:45:34
build the wall the right way ride the wall the right way it feels like he did that multiple times in this series and
1:45:40
now the DN freaks after seeing KT uh not have an answer for all these Midland
1:45:45
bands are up one0 and one game away from potentially securing their spot into the
1:45:51
PLS will they be able to do it let's find out as we send it back on over to the casters for game number
1:45:57
two thank you spacers for that wonderful breakdown love the telestration saying how it was totally
1:46:05
wrong for KT in that game number one and you know what it it was it was and both
1:46:10
both our analysts highlighted very well that it's a very risky comp you don't get enough picks you don't get enough of
1:46:16
a snowball you kind of just lose and that's exactly what we had to cast in that first game yeah I'm not sure what
1:46:23
Shinji is trying to tell KT here but I'm sure it's it's pertinent and important
1:46:29
and they need advice they need help because that was a rough game number one
1:46:34
and we also see what happens when one of the two pillars of KT falls apart cuz had a really rough game and that that
1:46:41
that was just kind of it didn't do well in a couple of early skirmishes everything fell apart very
1:46:47
very quickly I would guess perfect is going to be looking for a Renekton
1:46:53
here in this second game Cante I don't think should make it through the draft but maybe DN freaks is going to leave
1:46:59
that one open try and counter of someone else is yeah we were we were setting up for a B1 Renekton that's that's how
1:47:06
we're feeling right now vas yeah could also be Cante if it
1:47:12
doesn't get banned but let's see uh what they do go
1:47:18
for on the last uh roll of bans you had to ban scarner on righted side I was curious they were going to do with their
1:47:23
bands dnf because yeah five mid lane bands against bdd but you can't do that
1:47:29
scarner and four mid lane B what about kalista it's fine that could be an angle
1:47:35
you know if cassan doesn't get banned here and then dnf are like well you know
1:47:40
we're just going to leave kalista open cuz we need to ban out bdd then at least you're going to get trade okay you want
1:47:45
to play Cante or Anon we can get Cante if you pick youron we get Cante and
1:47:51
kalista so they're going to ban Cante here so they yeah they have to pick
1:47:57
kalistar or they're going to feel very heavily obliged to is Dean freaks just going to pick
1:48:04
away the reenex here cuz I think again it's being very clearly telegraphed po Also Rises monumentally in stock tiia is
1:48:13
no longer available but otherwise would be really good as well dudo is just going to go towards his Jacks one of the
1:48:19
Champions that particularly when given an early lead can really do well wouldn't mind a sigani pick up here had
1:48:25
a really rough paning game him going back to comfort would be no shock the only risk of that is that a possible nly
1:48:32
might come out to ruin your day CU we have not liked Misfortune one bit but he also hated corki and Berserker has just
1:48:39
been good doesn't really matter what Champions he's playing I think he's had a stellar return to the LSK thus
1:48:47
far which you know if you if you a 2021 Challengers Watcher you would this you
1:48:53
understand on a deeper level yeah uh there's not so many this all along
1:48:59
chronicler and just as cool as chronicler okay calm down vas uh NY
1:49:04
going to come out here so NY and yon going to be the choices here y was
1:49:10
banned in game one that was one of the Bley BS um but n this time you could say
1:49:16
is comfort as well for cuz I I wouldn't necessarily say it's aani level but has
1:49:22
certainly played a lot of games of n himself o piosik that's a ga throw I've ever seen
1:49:29
one does mean that you are going to be pretty heavy towards the ad Spectrum top
1:49:35
side of the map also might necessitate a few BS here from KT things like the Ari deblanc will come to mind in incredibly
1:49:43
strong in the 2v2 and I know that you know I talked about piosik bulldog
1:49:48
versus BD and cuz but even though piosik and bu bug didn't syn up quite as much
1:49:54
we still saw them particularly in team fights have a big impact as there as the absolute no-brainer Renekton ban that
1:50:01
one should not Shock anyone perfect things that you can go towards into the
1:50:06
Jacks gragas is the one that definitely is best but I don't know if he has an AP Gras in his
1:50:14
lineup yeah he's certainly going to be tested here and I don't know if that's
1:50:19
really good news for the side of KT rollster now they do they haveon and Italy for BD cuz they've got you know
1:50:26
their carries on stuff they can carry with the poy also taken away huh so you
1:50:33
could have picked that one yourself Prett pretty happily I might add into kalista yon and nle I think you
1:50:42
would have been very happy with that but I guess I didn't want to okay and then you yeah I I would have much preferred
1:50:48
to just pick them themselves feel like poppy is so insanely strong going to be Theona for
1:50:54
life life had a wonderful game number one Brom is still open here does uh get a good amount of value
1:51:02
here I think Braum does make sense he has not been looking too hot though Gras
1:51:08
Braum slam it doesn't seem bad it is a very nice front line when
1:51:14
you're going to have to deal with a lot of lock down with ja and Leona and MF
1:51:19
firing over the top they take away the Leona to deny you know a potential counter into the MF there's the gragas
1:51:27
so we're going to learn a little bit about Perfect's gragas a little bit more and thinking about
1:51:33
re for wayy that would put him on engage which I do think they need a little bit
1:51:40
of reliable engage with this kind of composition so I I don't mind it at all no the Braum does feel amazing to MF and
1:51:47
Leona and you're playing in to a pretty heavy melee composition but we're never going to be mad when especially when the
1:51:53
other pick is already shown giving your team a lot more reliable engag also we'll have to see what per Perfect's
1:52:00
going to go here I think the AP gragas is definitely the most solid asz the AR
1:52:05
Ben did not come through that it was the aali and the LeBlanc so Bulldog going for that final one not too shocking and
1:52:13
this is one of those scenarios where I look at the individual matchups on the KT side and I feel pretty good right
1:52:19
like uh in terms of laning strength you have already strong bot Lane you have the counter match up in top but then
1:52:25
they look at the comp as a whole and I think the burden of execution is actually pretty high between yon it's
1:52:31
really easy not of an impact Gras C the fact that K is playing n and then you
1:52:36
look at the D and freaks compound B Blaze itself really strong trv2 yet again this time with an incredible
1:52:44
amount of Mobility big AOE team fight ultimat lot of CC this kind of all comes
1:52:49
together here and we'll have to see if gaty can bring us to game number three Valas because I think the DN freaks particularly with how good that team
1:52:55
fights looked in that first game are going to be feeling pretty happy with this Reds side draft I think especially
1:53:01
I I'm agreeing with you on this one chronicler especially because so much of your engage power for KT comes from that
1:53:07
bottom lane from the Kalisa and the ra and duck Dom and S have been the weakest link uh together actually down in the
1:53:14
bottom side um so I don't know they're they're going to have to be clean in
1:53:19
this game and to be honest they haven't proven to be very clean so far so we'll see if they can do it or if this 2v2 in
1:53:27
the mid jungle can somehow carry once again with bdd and cuz otherwise KT
1:53:32
might be in some danger as you mentioned the DM freaks have been much cleaner tonight and they have a comp which with
1:53:39
they can do it once again so let's jump into game number two right now
1:53:49
[Music]
1:53:57
[Music] I'm KDA gragas I still can't believe
1:54:04
that's a real skin why why not what because it's funny it's absurd makes
1:54:10
sense to me I think he fits right in it's like cheese dip Zack you know it
1:54:16
exists yeah that makes sense cuz he's gooey
1:54:23
right and gragas is wearing a crop top so I I think it fits perfectly
1:54:30
actually it's a great combo sure uh perfect going for the
1:54:36
yeah perfect going for the tank build here as mentioned I do think that you
1:54:42
give up a lot when it comes to your actual threat in s side linee you can negate Lanes still very easily but with
1:54:48
the AP build you legitimately win side Lanes against Jack throughout most of the game
1:54:55
particular when you get access to a combo when you get your first L chapter back and I think with the tank build effects eventually going to get to the
1:55:01
point where you can't really match the Jacks anymore we'll see maybe he's going to go grasp into AP the one upside is
1:55:07
that if you are playing into a lane swap like perfect is here you're going to be feeling a lot better about your
1:55:13
situation I think he wants to try and get some XP but unfortunately for him this is warded O early e as well I'm not
1:55:21
going to be feeling good about that one and is going to try and get as much experience as he can Dudu has it a
1:55:27
little bit easier because he is Ja as perfect just just a little bit of XP
1:55:34
please guys come on as I say that Dudu has actually taken a considerable amount
1:55:40
of damage and we might be looking at a slow stack wave into nly dive here now
1:55:45
that is still Jack so I don't really think that they can do that and C seems to agree as he is dipping and I'm
1:55:52
towards the top side of the map yeah I mean naly as we know going to be very
1:55:58
fast on the farm is ahead of piosik kind of leaves that onus on piosik to
1:56:03
potentially set up some more plays you don't want to just be the farming uh Le in we did see it recently though I think
1:56:10
it was Canyon right he was playing farming Le in and then eventually he popped off but that's Canyon and a
1:56:17
little bit of a different situation so yeah that is kind of his thing I've seen the man I remember very VI L play
1:56:24
Pantheon as a farming jungler this was in like 2021 showmaker just only existed
1:56:30
to get PRI so that Canyon could steal the enemy Raptors and get ahead on Pantheon and they won yeah so might have
1:56:37
a little bit less to do with Pantheon and a little bit more to do with the team oh 100% yeah it was not Champion
1:56:44
related whatsoever but I mean now we've got mid in the Top Lane after the full clear
1:56:52
yeah cuz making sure that perfect gets to play the video game which is definitely a good call sway will take a
1:56:58
turret shot for his effort there but this is the problem it's Jax so actually getting damage into him as kalista not
1:57:05
going to be easy cuz on a ward here oh they going to keep going yeah I mean they're going to get this dive down
1:57:12
there's no Counter Strike so you just straight up die and there's no help you
1:57:17
know all the junglers were on the top side so they knew they were totally fine and safe to go for this dive in a 2v one
1:57:23
in 2025 not every day we see one of those but also Dudu was low enough as well it
1:57:31
just made the dive that much easier the way that was promised at least for that one play so Bulldog
1:57:38
nerves of Steel not going to be too easily scared but we'll definitely have to look for a back CS is going to be
1:57:44
basically even once everything comes through as we can see here both mid Lan is going to TP and we have even yes but
1:57:52
crucially no kill to go through so Dudu crucially doesn't have his Counter Strike it's about 5 Seconds off here we
1:57:58
just goes in doesn't give him the opportunity for counterplay gets the empowered AO knocks him back gets the Q
1:58:04
walks out of range immediately with the ignite already down and then Doom gets to actually push his damage
1:58:11
Doom has unfortunately not really been able to uphold the level that we Once
1:58:17
Upon a Time saw from him remember think back to 2021 was on a roster with peanut which actually ended up
1:58:25
working out a lot better than many of us expected also AOS was meta
1:58:31
so that did help he got to play a felios a lot and we didn't have Fearless so
1:58:37
yeah maybe seeing some of the weaknesses of duck in the new format and the new meta yeah I we also have just seen his
1:58:44
form I think on DK we already kind of s not able to uphold it but now is a Fed
1:58:49
kalista which is basically the position to be already sitting at almost uh what
1:58:55
is it 450 gold lead here see what else KT can get with it
1:59:01
because I do want to remind everyone this is what KT needs I think that they needs to keep a very tight lid on this
1:59:07
game not roller coaster too much and ensure that they consistently pick up these early objectives and don't take
1:59:15
skirmishes like they did in the first game that's why uh greas is very fun to
1:59:21
play into Jack by the way y nothing he can do well at least he gets to farm a
1:59:28
little bit and eventually be a threat in the side lane but for now just kind of
1:59:35
sitting around uh perfect used his his body slam to trade seeing that dudo was low on Mana felt safe to go ahead and do
1:59:42
that but that does mean that J can go in and land a Counter Strike bit of a trade up in the top side duck Dom is going to
1:59:49
cleanse and get out of that one berserk still holding on to his THS but a lot of
1:59:54
damage does come through from the kalista duck able to land that Q favorable trade for the DN freaks bot
2:00:02
Lane when it comes to the sums favorable for health for KT so we do have oh
2:00:09
counter or a yeah a little grass Croc but the body slam ends up getting perfect out of
2:00:15
Dodge is uh Berserker Berserker okay he's got barrier for now uh
2:00:23
there's the flx the follow way he's going to pick up the kill a solo kill is
2:00:28
now life getting in but that is yon he can't beat that champ as he will get
2:00:34
away very easily life just unlocking his hex flash for the
2:00:41
future oh life going to be feeling bad about that Rome uh also as a result Berserker dies and then the play also
2:00:47
doesn't work out cuz it looked like that was actually a timely arrival but because B had is so on bound and cuz
2:00:54
being nearly extremely mobile they're able to get out so that's a really big win for KT they get additional pressure
2:01:00
towards the top side as we take a look very straightforward I don't know what Berserker thought was going to happen a
2:01:07
little late there on the board even his emotes unfortunately not enough to disuade way and then way re does not
2:01:14
have a lot of damage and this will start with foshi invading uh then the flash being forced
2:01:21
and then it just just bdd and cuz knowing that the level six is not available for biosic they're going
2:01:27
aggressively and this is the tragic part like life flashing trying to get on top of the Yon with the soul Unbound no mana
2:01:33
on bulldog and no level six on piosik things are looking up 4 KT in this game
2:01:39
number two and they need to again we need to see them keep this pace set up
2:01:44
more of these objectives get that third kill for fizza Warfare but things are
2:01:49
looking better than game number one at least yeah they definitely are and I would not
2:01:56
be surprised to see them begin snowballing with a comp like this uh cuz
2:02:02
you know no whoopsies just yet bdd able to successfully get away from the Theona
2:02:08
without buring his blast so maybe they can set up something uh will be difficult to do onto
2:02:14
bulldog and maybe for the time being we just kind of get some objectives traded
2:02:19
you can see that dnf they don't really have a chance to fight over the grubs just based on the way this game is
2:02:25
going and with po farming the GRS on the top side of the map not going to be able
2:02:32
to take down a dragon either so just giving over all three grubs to KT
2:02:38
rollster yeah the big benefit of having double lane priority in both of the side
2:02:44
Lanes BD is still getting pushed in and mid cuz Bulldog is playing that match up nicely but doesn't really matter if both
2:02:50
as we saw stock D and way can just roam freely not get punished and then perfect is also having a much better time in
2:02:56
this Lane also hasn't been for men Dove like three times which I think also does
2:03:03
help you know in general in playing the game I think is beneficial to your gameplay
2:03:10
experience just don't get Dove do you know why there's a where there's a durian in this nly skins back animation
2:03:19
are you asking me why yeah I don't know there was a I don't know cuz I'm pretty sure it was it it
2:03:26
was yeah the cat was covering it probably cuz it smelled a little little funky little you know a little bit funky
2:03:33
just a little yeah lot funky i' I've had diran before it it wasn't that bad I
2:03:40
mean I I like the taste but it definitely in definitely a funky smell
2:03:47
yes just a little bit maybe I have a more sensitive maybe you just had a a
2:03:55
funkier durian you know like there's large parts of the worldway you're not allowed to bring them into trains and
2:04:01
stuff makes sense Bulldog uh not even going to ult away he's just taking a
2:04:06
bajillion damage approximately bulock really has been I feel like this has been a very consistent thing throughout
2:04:12
all of his games he's been very nerves of Steel like not using his flesh unless he needs to not just wasting the SS
2:04:21
perfect is a little low is also looking to go for a build with damage which I do applaud he had a really rough game
2:04:27
number one and seeing him go for the more AP heavy variant of greas is something that we think is a really
2:04:34
really good call even after such a rough game not losing confidence is something
2:04:39
that I think he has definitely struggled with re also got banned away as we have the dragon now also
2:04:46
going over KT looking a lot better in this early game now one kill and one OB objective off of getting those sandals
2:04:53
they got them in game one they lost but it's still good to get them it is still
2:04:58
good um generally more often you will win the game if you're getting early
2:05:04
objectives in one way or another and if you're getting the sandles and you're
2:05:10
getting those extra stats winning does help you win more winning does help you win more just like you know not getting
2:05:16
Dove helps you do damage M MH yeah avoid Dives perfect did an excellent job of avoiding
2:05:23
all the types like that wasn't even really his fault in the last game although I'm sure he got memd for the
2:05:29
the damage number but yeah I mean it was just an ambessa from behind not able to
2:05:35
do anything and then the team was so far behind that he was not able to do anything in the team
2:05:42
fights but now he's KDA
2:05:49
gragas I'm looking at for a joke with his KDA still being 00 Z is oh cuz yeah
2:05:56
good flash that that would have been the end of him everyone else in the area
2:06:02
feel like he should have seen that one coming yeah there is a little bit of like I'm N I can do whatever I want but
2:06:08
when you're playing against Ari especially got to be careful it's like Ari Leona and
2:06:14
Lee yeah good flash you're not really getting away from Sol call Great charm as well just the angle on that from
2:06:20
bulldog it was certainly going to land so getting out with his life and it
2:06:29
looks like both teams are gearing up for a bit of a grubs fight here question for
2:06:36
dnf is how many can they get cuz was doing the red
2:06:42
buff and not really in position to do them but you can see that dnf from
2:06:48
behind they're not going to stick around for too long they just want to get one and deny the Fe of strength and get away Sol call just
2:06:56
making sure that they don't get it grubs is I'd say the easiest to get when it comes to trying to stack those early
2:07:04
Feats so picking out a single grub makes that a lot harder good choice to disengage as well one of the big
2:07:12
benefits of the comp of the NFS is that even if we do get into a late game situation I think both their front to
2:07:18
back but also their pick potential is still insane with the amount of lock down down and burst that they have so as
2:07:23
long as they can keep looking for those opportunities and maintain map control I don't think they're ever going to be truly out of the
2:07:30
game do have bdd Sitting on a good amount of gold as well think should be
2:07:36
finishing his first item soon and I wonder when the and freaks are going to actually pull the trigger Perfect's got
2:07:41
to have a big buy as well been sitting on these components for a long time curious to see what he will end up
2:07:49
with more components yeah it's co a lot of CDR though I happy
2:07:55
with that as greas in particular uh Merks have been bought by dudo so his experience playing at a grag
2:08:02
is not going to be as miserable as it was before but still between the godex and the Kindle Gem and the boots of
2:08:07
Lucidity perect going to have a really high upt on those rotations what I do want to highlight though is that
2:08:14
KT keep matching cuz I think it was DN freaks initially that swapped I think
2:08:19
Dudu is a lot happier playing into D then he is playing into perfect gets to
2:08:25
take a lot more from the Y gets to contest a lot better than you do against
2:08:30
the Gras so would like to see KT at some point Swap and try and match that
2:08:35
counter match up again but Perfect's always going to be completely fine when it comes to farming as this is going to
2:08:42
be first tur blood there nothing that DN freaks can really do piosik on a back at
2:08:48
the moment and this might also lead into a possible fight towards that Dragon level 11 here for
2:08:55
bdd he tried to deny the cannon he was unsuccessful tragic that's like plus 70
2:09:04
gold for Dudu feeling pretty good about that there's really not much else to talk about in this game to be
2:09:12
honest yeah when when there isn't enough happening the costers eventually just
2:09:18
boom start making noises yeah our brains crave activity fa us and
2:09:24
we're not getting a lot yeah well made had a charm in top you know bu he did
2:09:30
yeah it was huge look at Perfect's health bar he did get they get hit yeah
2:09:36
another reason to play ap gragas is that he's pretty naturally
2:09:42
tanky anyway not quite as tanky as tank builds
2:09:47
gragas but at least you do damage and you do the Bomba yeah there there were
2:09:52
times where I think the tank build was really overtuned but ever uh after they did repeated Nerf to his passives I do
2:09:59
think that the AP but you can go like Bruiser is you don't have to go full glass Cannon AP but I just think it's so
2:10:05
much better Feats they are in they do not know about the Lee behind them
2:10:12
do okay he is going to flash away from that one and now it's just a kick on a Leona that's actually bosi in a rough
2:10:17
spot throws him in and now the turn is huge easy easy kill on AIC life will
2:10:23
flash away The Cask is very nice and perfect he wants more he's going to land the slow with the uh bomb there as now
2:10:29
bulldog has to flash himself does Dodge away from the on and Will Survive but at
2:10:35
the end of the day KT just getting so much out of this trade and you know the best part about
2:10:41
this is feles it's not cause bdd it's the rest of the team showing some signs of Life which I think after that game
2:10:48
number one was really necessary well CU also did not show a lot of life in the the last one but he's been fine on L
2:10:54
just doing what he needs to securing the objectives building a farm lead but it's actually the combo dock this time does
2:11:01
nail the response just flashes doesn't get caught in any rough situations and
2:11:07
then we're trying to kick the ra and the ra also has a kalista so it just doesn't
2:11:13
end up working out really nicely done there by Perfect gets himself the C over well to knock life back in and then yeah
2:11:21
the moment that he gets over and hits the cost there's no way that life ever gets out big win for KT that is the
2:11:27
dragon now going over to them as sperker just sold that yeah sold that q and was
2:11:33
like nope I don't want to have anything to do with that you remember in the draft when they picked
2:11:39
MF I do yeah they picked MF and you know there was no Leona pick or anything like
2:11:46
that but there was no Leona ban so n Leon was picked by KT and and then they first rotation on red side after the
2:11:54
second phase Leona and then Perfect's like you know what also stops MF Al is
2:12:02
gragas and I just wonder you know perfect he basically just had to show
2:12:08
his big belly at Berserker and Berserker just flashed away it's just that easy
2:12:14
and the MF does nothing especially from behind it just feels like dnf are are kind of sitting here losing you we
2:12:21
haven't had a lot of games like this so far on this patch I think which is probably a good thing we had a lot of
2:12:27
those in the past uh you know the J air days the old special the old bro days
2:12:32
where it was like we're losing what do we do let's uh do nothing and literally
2:12:38
they would just stand there and lose uh very nice combo here from bdd flash on in he wants the kill he will not have it
2:12:45
and gets pretty low himself but yeah dnf kind of doing that
2:12:51
that old style of lck which is not a good style of lck bulldog Staying Alive
2:12:56
there that's the biggest win that they've gotten in a couple of minutes oh here comes wey once another solo kill he
2:13:02
tasted blood you know he's like this is what used to happen all the time in Challengers you guys don't
2:13:08
know it's true in Challengers probably Bulldog would have stay stuck around to
2:13:14
farm the wave and just died yeah I I I could see it happen way of course part of of the KT
2:13:21
roster that did the unthinkable in Challengers which is just win everything
2:13:27
both the you know like Challengers equivalents of uh of Worlds just like
2:13:34
mini Challengers and uh both domestic splits now unfortunately no longer
2:13:41
together with hype and huk both of which are on bro we've been doing not as hot
2:13:48
as perhaps we expected but still a lot better than their recent years I I just
2:13:54
think they're going you know the C up it was a weird time they won it I I think that even if you're lacking a bit of
2:14:00
experience you can kind of get away with the kasp cup win but the second lck starts you really begin to see their
2:14:05
weaknesses so I wouldn't give up on bro just yet you know I think they've got some longevity I I believe in hok I
2:14:14
believe in guys like uh hype if he does stay loaned to the team and I think they
2:14:21
got a a nice amount of angles it feels like closer really fits but we'll have to wait and see how
2:14:26
that one goes for that team there been great not in this game yeah there's been great glimpses well you know it's KT's
2:14:32
there so we can still talk about them yeah same team uh duck going to just cleanse the slow and way is just going
2:14:38
to maybe die he does get pulled back by the fates call so dnf they found the one
2:14:44
angle as uh that was uh that was I think cuz slams his face on the keyboard and
2:14:49
presses every button at the at the same time oh yeah that was that was a lot of buttons to use so the Herold one is not
2:14:55
that bad the Sonia's armu guard obviously is very unfortunate will it
2:15:01
matter though VES I don't know I don't think kind of feels like no no I don't think it will
2:15:08
they're six or is a 5 and a2k gold behind
2:15:13
perfect like single-handedly is just kind of dancing on them as he does as KDA gragas yeah uh they're trying to
2:15:19
fight for this one life is probably dead as flash is already down piosik is Behind Enemy Lines and we also had doooo
2:15:26
tping into this one piosik is free food remember when waded broke down on the
2:15:31
space about how they could have just taken top turret KT in game number one and just given up the dragon it was the
2:15:37
third hexte dragon as well a little bit of a different situation cuz KT got the first couple of dragons yeah dnf they
2:15:44
could have maybe done that as well instead they elect to TP down take the worst fight of all time and also give up
2:15:49
the is way worse than the KT one the kt1 I understood a little bit this one I'm
2:15:57
um I'm vexed belas vex vex isn't in this game
2:16:03
actually so I can't be vexed
2:16:10
no we're trying we're trying to engage on on the gragas uh perfect did finish
2:16:15
is fimble winter does not care obviously gets so much shielding from that as well as a healthy portion of mana and then
2:16:23
unsurprisingly PO shik is just desperately trying to get out of a rough situation this game is this game is done
2:16:30
it's it's cooked there's no we we haven't even spoken about the fact that they also now have the Aon
2:16:36
buff which is going to make matters even worse our full and bdd just faded to
2:16:41
have the exact same thing happen to them where they're like just watching the rest of the M fall apart and they're
2:16:47
like what do I do what do I do I think at least bdd tried to do a little bit
2:16:53
more it's obviously a bit easier to do when you're TF Pantheon compared to Ari with a leas in
2:17:01
that does not exist he is not real and so you you just charm people and they
2:17:08
get away so yeah there's not really much that Bulldog can do anyway so it's not
2:17:14
his fault um you know maybe he could look for a pick on to BD maybe like an ALT in
2:17:20
but they have the Aon buff at the moment so now is not the time when is the time Valas after Aon buff maybe on the baron
2:17:29
um if if they allow you to get close to the baron oh my God this this Gras bu
2:17:35
man what like frozen heart next just say in all the blue items you know it's blue
2:17:42
gragas yeah Cosmic drive for at least a little
2:17:48
bit of AP plus the and it's it's blue speed yeah and the CDR it's always going to feel great a lot of
2:17:55
ability I think that's more important than CDR so what's next uh well
2:18:03
life is going to be okay the charm into the alt still have oton buff bdd goes in
2:18:10
might just kill Bulldog here no he will survive they still have the buff 15 seconds maybe a heal marry engage when
2:18:18
it times out but look at that KT not even taking the risk what is this is not my KT where's my roller coaster yeah
2:18:26
they're playing safe kind of feels like the new Aon changes just make it less
2:18:32
fun it was fun when the winning team would all just die for no reason even though it was very dumb and overpowered
2:18:39
but now it's like oh they're just going to lck it where they push and wait until it's 15 seconds left and then just run
2:18:46
away I went randin as well that's not blue um oh no the blue theory is just out the
2:18:54
window it wasn't a subscriber to the blue theory anyway fell do Eiffel what
2:19:00
is it 85 I want to say 65 6 I think it is 65 yeah wolf would know they're very
2:19:07
sad right now I wonder what those guys are up to nowadays who knows they were
2:19:13
like kind of one hit wonder for most of the world except wolf he he knows all about them you can ask about it yeah
2:19:20
this is maybe maybe this is one of those topics where if you say that there's a certain type of fan that gets really
2:19:26
offended like I do when you say Carly Ray jebson only haters Call Me Maybe I'm like that's the only song that I know so
2:19:33
no there's not I've let you you think I know the names of those other songs do they really
2:19:39
exist did it even happen at least at least you know I really like you right like that one you do know oh yeah yeah
2:19:45
that's true I do know that one yeah so that's two but it doesn't immediately come to mind when you say the name no um
2:19:52
for you guys who are curious the lowest amount of kills we had was 10 kills that was surprise surprise dnf losing against
2:20:01
DRX um it feels like dnf are just that team this season we always have the one
2:20:07
team you know it was bro last year just kind of sit around and lose just do
2:20:12
stuff you're going to lose anyway they're going to get hex Soul okay this is fine they're going to go for a
2:20:17
Hillary fight and we're going to get rection they going they're going to they're going to either win or lose the
2:20:23
game right here right now I'm leaning towards lose it was 10 kills the record
2:20:31
okay hex Soul's gone it's what all right hexx soul gone there's the flank they
2:20:37
have everything they ever could have wanted the MF does Al just to get Gras cast as I did mention that's a double
2:20:44
kill Penta angle Penta angle here Penta Penta Penta way go down duck looking for
2:20:51
he misses the and he might just go down at and the
2:20:57
minions so that yeah that was yeah kind of sad uh we're not going to break the
2:21:03
record for lowest amount of kills either do yeah if you play that I think uh you
2:21:09
know when there's too many juicy targets and you kind of just lose track and he
2:21:15
between them yeah you try to kill all of them and instead it just doesn't really work it doesn't matter for the game but that would have been
2:21:21
fun um I don't know why we're I mean I know why we're getting a replay but like
2:21:26
everything about this bdd failing his W over the wall and the fact that the hex
2:21:31
soul is already gone Berserker trying to channel an Olden perfect just from a
2:21:36
screen and a half way being like and then to play the game Doom
2:21:43
trying to get his Penta and then just eating a charm and dying I'm ready for the next game Bas
2:21:49
that's what I'm trying to get to here I've been ready for for like a good 15 20 minutes
2:21:56
like I am so ready for game three we we kind of had an inkling that
2:22:02
would go to three he's a man with a dream no no dream he's still behind where did he
2:22:08
even go no he's still behind them they don't know he went into the river they're not aware he's
2:22:14
pulling he's trying to Challenger to Challenger uh okay well um they he got
2:22:20
the kick and duck will die it's a one for one trade until until the rest of
2:22:27
the fight happens where it's not a one for one trade and KT just bought them over the head and there you go maybe
2:22:34
just headbutt them over the head and uh yeah just going to be a full-on ace down
2:22:39
will go life and duu not very long for this world he does have his Zas to keep
2:22:45
us in this game for just a little bit longer and there you go full Ace does go
2:22:50
the way KT and they will look to end the game going to be close to 30 minut even
2:22:57
sub 30 minutes finish here Bulldog will be up in 12 seconds but I don't think we're going to see him in this game any
2:23:04
more Val as we are going to a game number three KT after a rough game one bounce back in
2:23:11
pretty pretty crazy fashion and thean freaks when they win they look good but
2:23:17
when they're losing not nothing really happens yeah not much happened in that
2:23:24
game uh except KT just kind of taking the entire map and going on to win the
2:23:30
game felt a little bit like game one but game one had more back and forth early
2:23:35
on it just felt like dnf got behind and then they just decided okay let's try to
2:23:40
scale up let's try to wait and they never were able to do anything they lost
2:23:46
hex tech Soul you know maybe hoping for like a lower roll on the soul and perhaps they can play it out in 35
2:23:53
minutes but I can't believe that the scaling Lee MF didn't work very rough
2:23:59
yeah that's the thing we are going to game three so the draft's going to look differently there
2:24:05
maybe this time perfect gets to play his Renekton and good bounce back game perfect has been a player that I think
2:24:11
has been on a pretty heavy scrutiny understandably this is a second GE on the KT roster this game did make good
2:24:17
use of the counter pick BD no notes you know it's speed I don't really think we need to talk about and douam and way
2:24:24
stepped it up and maybe in game three we get an actually competitive game for the whole duration can you believe F this
2:24:32
I'll believe it when I see it chronicler let's go to a break and have the space to break it down we'll be right back
2:24:46
[Music]
2:24:54
[Music] [Applause] [Music]
2:25:05
[Applause] [Music]
2:25:20
oh
2:25:27
[Music]
2:25:52
[Music]
2:26:07
[Music] for
2:26:20
[Applause] [Music]
2:26:27
[Music]
2:26:44
that edge of night is so important to deal with now h on a flank angle they haven't dealt with the wave just
2:26:51
yet this there flanks upon flanks flanks is crashing as well did they go yeah
2:26:57
Morgan's making his way around the ulti comes down from closer huk misses the Q though as C goes in closer is the one in
2:27:04
trouble but he lands the combo and it does so much damage has to flash for it and now do on top of hype do may be the
2:27:11
hero for KT as Morgan in the river by himself now H picked up by B
2:27:24
what can they find can they get on top of L stei you remember Rich does not have a
2:27:29
splash angle here on a dooo but sponge is kind of going for a walk on the left side he's so tanky though you again he's
2:27:36
going to find the front line massive Oriana ultimate but it just there's no followup he catches a lot but the DPS
2:27:43
isn't there ZX are too far ahead and utal has put on a show once again
2:27:55
he's got his in the wrong position I'm like everybody except way is having a pretty good time we is sacrificing
2:28:01
himself right so that's why uh yeah I mean all of KT can never perform at the same time that would not be KT at all
2:28:09
yeah okay how does that ho even get the does
2:28:15
he die yeah uh because yeah smashes chases him down has the extra movement speed from the Inspire and it is so D
2:28:23
like this is this should be just baren the EV and flow of this fight
2:28:30
though you can see now Morgan moving in spots the teleport might see that this is the time magnastorm this time finally
2:28:36
working up the polymorph is gorgeous on Morgan into the back line he's stunned forever but he still has access to that
2:28:42
Counter Strike and he's still going to be Fe
2:28:53
get in there four people with the ultimate and now hyp can you do can you
2:28:59
be the Savior can you be the her the blackash is so [Music]
2:29:06
good now they're pushing into the river Still Standing what doesn't kly makes stronger Den on the dragon ocean so
2:29:14
points I said they wouldn't fight over it they're all going all in ki knocking up everybody but he's super low and K in
2:29:21
the back line is totally fine but D just got here and now it's a 55 but everybody
2:29:26
the kick is massive from Canyon but it might not matter D in that
2:29:33
backline not able to quite do enough damage but pan as well still alive full health but he doesn't have a front line
2:29:39
anymore the knockup comes in and pan so sad for him he gets knocked down
2:29:53
[Music]
2:30:07

2:30:25
[Music]
2:30:40
[Music]
2:31:07
[Music]
2:31:17
[Music]
2:31:36
did anyone really think this was going to be a quick two Z of course not when KT and the Dan freaks are involved we're
2:31:44
going to three it is tied up one to one as KT dominated almost perfect gamed the
2:31:50
DM breaks for 28 minutes until the last couple of fights that blew the game wide open welcome back to space Deon
2:31:57
alongside W did and wolf let's get straight to it draft time because it felt good until there was one big clear
2:32:05
glaring maybe three times played by wiid Champion that was open uh and for some
2:32:10
reason we with Leona I mean w did that were watching this like wow it's the perfect re angle they have Misfortune they have jax which pairs well with it
2:32:17
it's super easy to lock re here and I I think maybe they decided to go Leona because they were scared that Leona on
2:32:23
the other side could mess up some of their combos it can be quite strong into Misfortune but it just seemed like the
2:32:29
the pros were way higher than the cons of actually flipping this the other way I mean besides of draft they still had a
2:32:36
really strong o game draft so they could actually win out uh from this draft but still you know they really didn't have
2:32:42
clear plan for the game so we're going to see it on the Highlight anyway so yeah this felt and the broadcast brought
2:32:48
it up this felt very much like like a fall behind do nothing lose at 30
2:32:53
something minutes and they called it pretty early and this is why early on couple mistakes here by like yeah so
2:32:59
first of all they got traded on top side it was really like bad trade from uh
2:33:05
Kate uh dnf side so after that they gave up all the pressure from the top side
2:33:10
and Leona choose to reset and they tried to give some pressure on the mid lane cuz Leona could just go on the mid lane
2:33:17
right uh on top of that MF got Kill by real but they had to win this two versus
2:33:23
three cuz it's only Leona moving towards mid lane right but I think that was
2:33:28
really bad execution from uh life especially because lein had Q on need
2:33:34
but he somehow tried to like stun on yon and outcome of that was really bad uh
2:33:40
towards dnf here cuz KT was just having fun here nothing happened yeah this ends
2:33:45
up being a big disaster here life using his Flash and life specifically on Leona
2:33:51
we've seen it this tournament it's not been his strongest pick right and this is showcasing some of those issues here
2:33:56
in this game as well he's played it a few times not the greatest KDA some big errors um some disappointed uh coaching
2:34:02
staff as well with some of these moments but the Leona just didn't work out that play didn't work out and it was just
2:34:08
another one of those glaring issues here for Dean freaks when it looks like they have a really strong game plan with some
2:34:13
of their drafts the execution is super crisp and other games like this one it feels like it's freestyle and they're
2:34:18
not doing very well with that yeah I mean props to way for finding that engage on the rail in a cannon minion
2:34:24
wave where the damage was extra for the side of KT and you could see the idea was right they wanted to try and get
2:34:31
something to happen in mid lane and then uh we know we had mad movie earlier in
2:34:36
uh the break this this one would file under sad movie for so KT are getting
2:34:41
Dragon right had s lane control of bottom side this whole time top side control did belong to the dean freaks
2:34:48
they weren't able to do anything to perfect up here Bulldog we were joking did one rotation of spells on him to stop his back moments before and poosi
2:34:54
goes for this long con flank here and then completely unfortunately the execution is botched so flash here from
2:35:01
Duck do is fantastic avoids a solar flare then he goes for a kick play here unfortunately Fates calledo is still
2:35:07
available so the one area you actually had pressure on the map the one place where you needed to make a play way
2:35:12
faster than this they waited for the herald fight gave enough time for KT to rotate up the execution again poor for
2:35:17
piosik here because Fates call exist it buys enough for that rotation of the Y to come here and look who's not here
2:35:23
this entire time the ja he doesn't have Sid Lane control so he's not pressuring the turret during this either and it's
2:35:28
just a big whiff here on the map across the board for dnf actually uh pooshi could outplay that so well because he
2:35:36
was in a really great position but he used the blasone right instead of that if he did the ward and Flash W to cancel
2:35:44
his motion and kick kalista towards his Leona I think that could work but as you
2:35:50
mentioned execution wise it was really bad from them as yeah that one was that one was pretty tough uh the three of us
2:35:56
here were watching it in the space and lost our minds from that cuz we knew that the fates call was coming on in one
2:36:03
to one drafts have gone a little obviously deeper a little wonky we're not best of five we are just best of
2:36:08
three but what do you want to see here from uh the freaks as they return back to blue side which has been so dang
2:36:14
dominant here in the lck I mean it's not a huge draft issue to be honest they had Leasing which is really strong in the
2:36:21
ear laning phas and also they had really strong in the B Lane as well like MF and Leona so it was really not the draft
2:36:28
issue but as I mentioned so many teams are missing their pre-plan thingy so they should think about what they should
2:36:34
do in the other game and then it will make it easier before we toss real quick wolf what has Eiffel 65 been up to I
2:36:42
mean they they tried to reform and did some experimental stuff that's more like their second album europop but it didn't
2:36:47
really land so they disbanded try it again and nobody really knows what they're up to now yeah well The Blue
2:36:54
Team here looking for a win and trying not to end up too sad let's send it on over to our newly educated Eiffel 65
2:37:00
fact casters Valdez and chronicler thank you our experts on
2:37:08
Eiffel 65 and also the pre-draft or the play the pregame thingy I think is what
2:37:15
he called it uh whatever you commit to from your draft is what wed was going
2:37:22
for and yeah it's true they should I don't know if ever in the history of humanity has been such a wide breath of
2:37:29
knowledge contained in such a short segment um 65 about drafts about pregame things
2:37:38
and Eiffel 65 and uh we just because that last game kind of made us lose our minds because not nothing happened for a
2:37:45
very long time we have returned to the game plan of ban out bdd a lot of trademark picks have already
2:37:53
been taken away no toia no Ari which we have all also seen him pilot noon as he
2:37:59
played it himself is the asreal then going to come through I wonder if we're getting to the point where the kaisa
2:38:05
priority is going to start to rise Caitlyn is another pick that we see often pop up when we get to this point
2:38:10
in the draft a varas ban seems pretty prudent as well as that is probably the
2:38:15
highest tier 80 carrier that is still available and there it does come through
2:38:20
Cante is still waiting fighting his time I think
2:38:26
KT Bennett here but most likely that get it gets bended away and we don't get
2:38:32
cassant in this series I mean if they take Cante maybe you just take Jace right so they might be saying okay well
2:38:39
we've got an answer maybe we want to ban something else they do go ahead and ban Wukong uh this is without Ari available
2:38:47
so you know that's a do we've seen a a couple of times now Arian Wukong just going to take the Wukong and say that's
2:38:53
a that's a very strong pick right now in the jungle now Dante a very scary
2:38:59
thought and it might just come through here I think we'll definitely get to see either perfect on Renekton or Jace in
2:39:06
order to counter this if it does get locked in here and there you
2:39:12
go we have not seen any super strong dance in in a I want to say very long
2:39:18
time or uh B counter picks into the cassant they actually feel like they're putting him down things like the Gwen
2:39:24
come to mind we had a period of time where we did go for that normally this is what happens you handshake it with Jace yeah which is also a tank now kind
2:39:33
of usually goes for the hybrid build where you end up going for the Spear of shoin able winter to still have a big
2:39:40
enough Mana pull and your base damage is crazy so even with the base damage you
2:39:46
not Amplified by any items outside a shoin you're be fine what is the setup
2:39:51
going to be here do we lock a champion for bdd I do think his champion pool can be trusted that is a
2:39:59
classic maybe we really return oh and we're going like Vigo landra uh I do
2:40:06
think vgo has just not felt that strong for a good amount of time and the teams
2:40:12
that have been trying it I think haven't really been making it work I think DN freaks are feeling pretty good so far
2:40:19
with the draft that they've secured valz it's just some more aggressive Kate
2:40:25
Lux whove got a lease she does more damage trying to maybe counter this with
2:40:32
something that can threaten uh both the Kate and the Elise
2:40:38
but instead just going to go for jyn maybe try to match the range with this pick but yeah KY just
2:40:46
kind of have free champions and I I I think the DN freaks they have a very strong bot Lane they've got
2:40:53
duante yes perfect has the answer to it but I don't know I I feel like KT needs
2:40:59
a lot of rounding out here on their comp at this point in time thankfully we do
2:41:04
have a second phase to do just that really do the Gin does make sense
2:41:13
in that it is a traditional not counter but neutralizer for caitan it's something that we used to see in top a
2:41:18
lot as well where you go gragas and Grena and you just kind of Stonewall the lane I don't think it is quite as
2:41:25
convincing with the elite also being there my biggest issue with Elise trying to pick like Blitz crank
2:41:32
or uh picking a pike is that she's even
2:41:38
though she stay scenar still feels very slippery and trying to get a Caitlyn consistently is quite hard I would much
2:41:44
rather see you pick for the team fight and just look for a lane swap although Jace is definitely going to feel worse
2:41:50
than Cante also what will bdd play I've been talking about the
2:41:57
possibility of a vagar for a while that I actually think I actually quite like I
2:42:04
think that you are not going to match the Allin potential but this should be able to contest the early levels and the
2:42:09
early push which should neutralize these type of kill Lanes Bulldog going to have to Blind here and with this you also
2:42:17
shut out a ton of Champions that I think BD would like to play here uh if it's bdd zerif I think you're very happy
2:42:24
because of the specifically Vago bdd kind of has to play something
2:42:31
that can set that up because right now they have zero setup for fgo this is a reset champion and you don't really have
2:42:37
anything that sets it up thus far yeah like this is a really strong
2:42:43
2v2 and it it does actually create the kill pressure that you need but playing a comp with no engage versus I think
2:42:50
again really well runed team comp is definitely going to be tough that champion is not available a syndra would
2:42:56
also fit the bill bdd going back to it would be amazing and there it is
2:43:01
showmaker watching bdd play two of his favorite champ back to back in the series well
2:43:09
back to back with a game y between y doesn't count y speak not not a real
2:43:14
champ get that out of my it's not a mage it only exists in my nightmares actually
2:43:19
I always I just ban him I do B him every game actually still yeah to this as you
2:43:25
should so Syra actually going to come through I mean there's a lot of range there's a a lot of poke as well even
2:43:32
with the karma coming through but as you mentioned there's there's really no engage like almost none like you get Pok
2:43:38
into like a deadly flourish and you have like roots and stuff and you just kind of keep them at range the comp is really
2:43:44
good when you're winning you know you can set a vision traps they they force a face check they W into scatter and then
2:43:50
you have the long range followup but what if you're losing yeah the the uh FF the I think this is the type of
2:43:56
composition like Vio syndra Jin Karma there can only be winning because if you
2:44:02
start losing I I don't I don't think you get a away back into the game for Kate for uh DM freaks like your team fight is
2:44:08
still amazing obviously you're still trying to get as much done in the early game the Kate and Elise but with that
2:44:14
top side you can go late and be fine to skills amazingly you have the double
2:44:20
tank Duo Sani engage yeah and then this I think Champion strength is good I
2:44:27
think there's a lot of comfort but it feels like it kind of needs to go well
2:44:32
early we'll see if they can do that so far the red side has not been doing that but let's jump onto the rift for game
2:44:38
number three
2:44:50
[Music] all right here we go level one trying to
2:44:57
come in here as team is KT they will sweep out the ward and Bulldog just maybe trying to
2:45:05
see what he can see but just hanging around in mid for now KT did do this in game one I think they had a bit of a
2:45:12
better invade comp this one isn't terrible but still able to push in as a
2:45:18
team get some Vision but of course tnf are able to do just the same on the top side of the
2:45:24
map yeah you don't want to be Jace stuck in a 1v2 lane against Elise
2:45:31
Caitlyn that sounds about as unfun as it can be yeah you remember last game as
2:45:38
well uh that might be his reality though yeah we had we had who was it it was Dudu playing ja and he died 2v one yeah
2:45:48
I do I do think that Jax is is actually a lot more doable and he just misplayed early on really respect as much as he
2:45:55
should but I actually like this from KT like just don't don't put perfect in that lane just don't do it he's just
2:46:01
going to die there's no value try and have him make an impact on the rest of the map as Dudu just needs to make sure
2:46:08
he doesn't eat too much poke but he also wants to get experience and those two things are unfortunately kind of mutually
2:46:15
exclusive we'll see if Perfect's going to try try and join this botside
2:46:21
dive Bonanza that I think is about to break out here cuz does really want to hit Level free yeah and the vgo thus far
2:46:28
hasn't really worked out getting another ear kill onto him would be absolutely huge just Dudu he knows what's about to
2:46:33
happen life is backing now but he's not making it here in
2:46:39
time well it's uh it's a flash but the deadly flourish comes in way should be able to tank two shots but he tanks a
2:46:45
third and just dies oh no level two here here for Dudu and he's got his W but
2:46:51
down he will go it's traded he gets two of them down and it looks like one of
2:46:57
them was in execution but still that was not the fourman dive you were looking for it was not adudu actually hits level
2:47:07
two there for out that dive gets access to a w and that is the big game breaker
2:47:12
and still teams are not ready for the extra damage that comes now I still
2:47:19
think even with everything going as poorly as it this is a win for KT because they had a kill on the vgo they
2:47:24
get the matchup that they're looking for which is perfect into dooo instead of having the Jace be stuck in a one V2
2:47:31
Lane against this Elise and Caitlyn but the fact that Duda got a counter kill is
2:47:36
huge the fact that cuz wasn't able to make it out we also dying with his flash up I think that kill again is as big a
2:47:43
deal but maybe an extra rotation uh maybe a little bit of shielding could have been a Difference Maker Now dockum
2:47:51
and wey are pretty far behind in experience and they're going to have to try and catch back up as piosik will get
2:47:58
spotted but he is making his way over level three still ways away for way they
2:48:04
have so much lock down here with the Elise and traps but life is in a bit of trouble he is going to go in with this
2:48:10
one take the aggro go up into the sky but it is a bit of a scary dive Zer had
2:48:16
aggro there so yeah that was life didn't actually cuz the whole point of the Elise is that you specifically get to
2:48:23
drop aggro at will now they are going to go for a Reda here flashes are still available ways now level three as well
2:48:29
the cool Downs are going to be back up I don't think that they can do this they're definitely going to try and life needs to get uh yeah that's a Teleport
2:48:37
yeah well L life is going to go up into the sky The Flash that's a lease doesn't
2:48:44
make any sense this has been meta for a while now oh wait yeah no way you could
2:48:52
say um yeah that that was rough I I think also the dive was pretty rough though from the side of tnf like Pik
2:48:59
moving in first taking aggra they totally just try to abandon ship and then somehow they they win off of it
2:49:06
just by The Flash being burnt as now an angle bit of damage coming in duck down
2:49:13
it's totally fine and now life you could have hit those he would have died
2:49:20
uh all righty then okay yeah this is totally
2:49:27
fine just lose some League of Legends everyday League of Legends okay
2:49:32
so great flashh there Dodges the stun then is able to stay alive I think
2:49:39
actually due to the kill right uh even though he doesn't get
2:49:45
EX then gets level two which gives him exess to which is why with that damage reduction
2:49:51
why he's able to stay alive in the first place yeah those were KT rollster fans
2:49:56
that were that is always the KT rollster look though astonished yeah it's just
2:50:01
permanent all their faces kind of kind of scary bdd then also tping towards top
2:50:07
and ways like I can set you up but for only for that to not really work
2:50:12
out yeah I think both teams are feeling the pressure
2:50:19
the game maybe no can we like do it again FAS this is a lesson in life
2:50:25
sometimes think aren't pretty they're not perfect and we're just going to have to look yeah perfect is the top laner
2:50:31
for KT I uh I I walk that one that one was so easy there's already enough going
2:50:38
on so easily for that one atted steal not going to work out cuz it's going to
2:50:44
take dragon as well it's just a word I need to be able to say that word yeah okay you know what
2:50:51
you know what screw you an atlas I'm just going to say pristine only no more perfect no more free jokes I'm fine with
2:50:58
that there's no player named pristine you know he can't mem you on that one so yeah you would you would get us there
2:51:05
that would be kind of funny if there was like another upand cominging top laner and he just named himself pristine it's
2:51:10
not like I'm better than perfect I'm pristine it's not a bad name it's it's pretty cool I like it okay 2v2 round
2:51:19
four can we do it I don't know if I want to see this again actually can we just
2:51:25
keep at round three I mean he's doing it he is Ting he's going to get over the wall poik has
2:51:32
to flash away here and now maybe the leash on the piosik but there's no
2:51:38
followup piosik is Sani and created enough distance I I really would have much
2:51:44
rather that he flashed over the wall and kept ex's if you're committing to that
2:51:50
keep access to the old so you have access to the damage because if you old over the wall you're always going to lack the damage yeah to take down
2:51:57
piosik still get the flesh out of the Sani so that's definitely nice he still
2:52:05
has the early kill but the game needs to I think keep swinging in KT's favor and so far it's
2:52:12
been basically even with the objectives also being even
2:52:17
thus far obviously dragon is a little bit more valuable than the grubs but to see what happens on the next
2:52:24
spawn yeah it's you know it's it's a very slight lead it is a lead it doesn't
2:52:29
feel like enough of a lead to feel good about their composition if it goes even into the mid game you know which is
2:52:35
really the the main thing we were talking about in this draft is KT's comp that has zero engage you're you're just
2:52:41
kind of sitting there hoping for a scatter the week or you know a deadly flourish otherwise you're just kind of
2:52:47
getting pelted by some really nice poke and an actual front line that dnf have and KT do not
2:52:55
have what do you mean they have tank Chase they have paperman in the jungle
2:53:00
it's vgo he he's going to Bruiser e is build
2:53:06
uh they also have shields from Karma right chronicler yeah yeah notorious for
2:53:11
making you tanky enough to tank the damage that's going to come through fortunately Jay doesn't need to build
2:53:17
damage to do damage so they'll have a good amount of poke and as long as they maintain map control I cuz to me this
2:53:24
composition is not like it really I think it will still have a good amount of threat come mid to late game but it's
2:53:30
just you need to start off every fight by one-shotting someone and if you lose weap control I just think realistically
2:53:35
it'll be really hard there are scenarios where you can do like the absorb and engage you know like they over invest
2:53:42
and then you have the kite back with J with the J old and then you re-engage and then maybe you do something of the
2:53:48
sort but does feel like somewhat of a stretch I think both teams also really wanting to take this one Doom now level
2:53:55
six will be getting close to seven Berserker up about a full level here at
2:54:00
almost 30 CS as well we're going to equalize a little
2:54:05
bit but the gin and the swapping not really working out too
2:54:12
nicely here for the bot Lane of KT yeah they didn't have a lot of great
2:54:18
options you know especially game three of a Fearless drafting system and you're
2:54:25
playing into Caitlin Elise so it's like well well that you could have done the
2:54:30
bdd plays jacee mid as ad and then you pick a tank and then dock down just locks
2:54:36
sigs yeah that could and then you also completely neutralize the Kate at least
2:54:42
lane cuz you just wave clear indefinitely yeah could have been good maybe Duck D not wanting to play zigs I
2:54:50
I think he has has yeah um I I
2:54:55
don't really remember how it went I think it was okay that's usually what
2:55:01
happens asz we do have the grubs being taken by piosik cuz not going to do too
2:55:09
much although seems to go back on that decision even a single grop I think would be big here they want to get a
2:55:14
catch yeah they're going to get the scatter and bulldog in a bit of trouble the f here and he is actually just going
2:55:20
to run away he does Flash for it that's a good cool though to get the stationary
2:55:26
Target like the way and they will get their grub as well the one grub the
2:55:31
denial of the objective here for the feed of strength for dnf that's really
2:55:37
what it means a little bit of that extra XP for cuz who is very far ahead he's actually
2:55:44
the most far ahead out of any player on the rift even more than the Caitlyn over the
2:55:49
Jin with that first blood or not first Blood I was it first Blood I guess it
2:55:55
was first Blood Cuz the first death was actually execution it was yeah so that was first
2:56:01
Blood to uh vgo which does make sense why he is ahead you know you get some
2:56:07
items you're able to clear faster you're oh look at that always going to have good clear like this from perfect going
2:56:13
for the black lever and I get a ton of value out of that I don't love
2:56:18
who seems to be going collector first and then we going to go like
2:56:25
Lord why it's more so the build oh okay cuz I I do know that Jin will never excel at killing tanks but you are
2:56:32
playing into double armor stacking and your going collector as Jin as
2:56:39
Jin um which I don't love but you need to kill someone and I guess they're going to just all in on trying to kill
2:56:45
Bulldog Berserker or life um how good his Target access is going to be in that regard though so we
2:56:51
do have cuz waiting and we also have a roam down
2:56:56
from Bulldog I'm pretty sure he was spotted they definitely no yeah there's
2:57:02
a w in the river okay now how do you retake bdd well that'll do it engage
2:57:09
Syra uh flashed in surely they can follow up on this why you know what I
2:57:16
mean they did a lot of damage right dudo is here Perfect's
2:57:21
there dragon is in the dragon piit life takes about his whole health
2:57:30
bar and no one gets Dragon the engaged cindra VES never thought I'd see
2:57:37
today BD's taken it into his own hands game three he's like man this team is
2:57:43
heavy I got to try my best on Syra that we were bored after last game get
2:57:48
imagine how it feels playing that game yeah never going in as we now will have cuz I I I hope
2:57:56
just let the Krabby go because BD is catching a wave let him have it it's fine Berserker is alone they don't know
2:58:04
where the Elise is lot of poke coming down I don't mind if dock opened up
2:58:10
doesn't seem to be doing it just yet ooh if got that auto off would have been big but Berserker does make sure he doesn't
2:58:17
get too close close and The Collector is going to feel good as long as you're Ling into Berserker who still up a full
2:58:23
level and a bit of experience here got them about to D level 9 just now hit
2:58:30
it back and forth that is that what that's what we asked for uh I think we were expecting a little bit more action
2:58:35
of the non missing skill shots or going in and
2:58:41
and hitting skill shots but nothing happening variety but it's better than game two I'll take it I I thought dnf
2:58:47
would do a little bit more you well they don't have to you got Elise yeah but can make plays in their case I
2:58:53
think actually the right thing is to just not do anything at all because if you just don't tell them thaton not
2:58:59
kidding they already did that if you get to 5V fs and you have like two free items in your way and you have three
2:59:05
items on Berserker I I think you just win by the full as long as you execute on the team fights which by the way you
2:59:12
have two front liners you great engage with your Sani yeld yeah there's only
2:59:17
squishy on the enemy team well I guess Perfect Isn't squishy but he's still a good Target this is the vision trap we
2:59:24
were talking about here it is there's their big engage uh they are going to catch life 100% they did it they got the
2:59:31
Elise and the followup here another stun from cuz going to force a flash out of piosik and you know what if dnf face
2:59:39
check and unwed brush there is a way for KT to get kills there is I saw it with
2:59:45
my own eyes there is a shot vales uh didn't love the angle which dock opened up with there as well felt like
2:59:51
they should have been able to maybe get a little bit more out of that but we'll take it perfect probably going to have
2:59:58
to give up this turret which means that the erase first turret ooh this is low
3:00:04
but yeah I don't think they're going to be in time unless should probably be hitting this right
3:00:12
uh uh I'm pretty sure they could have gone they would have gotten it if Dudu just stuck around and hit the turret
3:00:17
instead yeah it who needs de Feats the strength anyway they're totally overrated yeah
3:00:23
when I said don't do anything this was not what I was referring to I just want to be very clear about
3:00:31
this yeah it's a excellent example of the SpongeBob you know episode where
3:00:38
Plankton's like all right now give it to him and then SpongeBob just gives him the ice cream so you can have it so yeah
3:00:46
you can have first turn R blood well we don't need that well they don't have the the sandals yet you know you just have
3:00:52
to get the free kills first and get two more objectives are we going to hit three kills in this game for one team I don't
3:01:00
know still yet to be seen surely okay KT you do not have control they're going to
3:01:06
try and force a little bit get the TP maybe you just take that yeah they'll get the TP a lot of damage a lot of poke
3:01:13
coming down dudo he wants more he is angry after giving up he doesn't have Q3
3:01:19
and so he's just a rooted Cante because he didn't dodge that either and well
3:01:25
they're going to drop the rift so they should be able to get this turret here we go charge on
3:01:32
in uh okay didn't get it there for a second was a little bit worried but they
3:01:37
got the turret good enough I'll take it bit of action like they get the heral we get a
3:01:44
bit of a scuffle as we take another look there are people that can face check
3:01:49
that and that's piosik and the Cante I don't think life nor Bulldog should be
3:01:55
anywhere near the unwatered dangerous brush when the whole point of KT is that
3:02:02
they're playing a pig composition and they need a kill desperately for the plan work um but I think it's a lesson
3:02:07
that D and freaks can take and if they implement it in their game play then it'll it'll be good yosik will find way
3:02:14
there's a flash as way had to I don't even know if he had to flash but he Flash the Q3 I think it was a w of Cante
3:02:21
earlier to make sure he didn't get dragged back does mean he needs to be a bit more respectful now the cleaver is
3:02:26
going to help a little bit with killing Dudu but Dudu is 100% just going to build more and more resistances and
3:02:34
going to get harder to kill bdd realistically doesn't really want to be bothered by trying to kill Cante that's not a good use of his
3:02:40
time so we'll have to see who is going to take care of dudle later on I don't think it'll be the collector first genin
3:02:46
although he is building towards a lord dump second so that's nice at least the new change 100 gold more expensive 5% 5% 5%
3:02:57
armor pan is good it is good it's worth and he'll get it eventually he's
3:03:04
going to be killing tanks Jin well he he'll be trying KT I I
3:03:10
really was hoping for a higher Pace with how this game should go for you if you do want to win it because I think DM DM
3:03:18
freaks are just chilling right now like they're feel Soul ocean soul so it's like
3:03:24
ah whatever you can take it it's fine I mean if they get ocean soul
3:03:29
themselves or any amount of ocean Drakes I feel like they're going to be kind of laughing their way to the bank where H
3:03:36
and soul for KT is like it's good I you know they would it's always they
3:03:41
wouldn't mind it but at the same time I don't feel like the value is as high it's not and uh there now you have to
3:03:48
fight every single ocean Drake cuz you don't want to give them over to dnf yeah there are edge cases where you have like
3:03:55
a fight that's really messy and it's just a bunch of skirmishes I think that's a scenario where you do actually get a lot of value of champion like vgo
3:04:01
and Jay who can kind of weave in and out get a lot of rotations off and in that case I think it's pretty good but that's
3:04:07
not really what thean freak should be looking for should just be looking for straight up good old honest 5V FS as we
3:04:15
have life waiting biting his time like a trapdoor spider
3:04:21
this time the brush is warded by him and nkt is like NOP do they know
3:04:27
uh-uh they they really they should uh well wey is in a bit of trouble just a
3:04:32
little just a little bit not a lot takes a bit of damage that's two old and Karma
3:04:39
did get chunked but is definitely not taken out of the fight here yeah uh KT
3:04:45
do not have axes though they don't have control of the river which I do feel like they really need BD has his flash
3:04:51
available maybe he's the hero that they need they're going to engage onto the Sani and duck he's just burning down so
3:04:58
quickly as now the whe Al the way Al rather is going to push them back and
3:05:05
just like that dnf will net themselves a dragon without doing all too much I want
3:05:11
to highlight again if DM freaks get more ocean Drakes the game does kind of
3:05:18
yeah it does it's it is kind of over yeah um this just one so it's fine they
3:05:24
will also ensure that the battle for the sandal continues still not done because
3:05:31
we haven't had free kills yet this do we have that stat like the latest this has got to be strength this is 100% it
3:05:39
there's no way secure cuz it used to be first blood and then after that it was like we've only
3:05:45
had three kills in this series certainly with a new patch you would
3:05:50
have to imagine um Zer kind of out of position but rotating over and now with the drag on a duck who's just going to
3:05:56
have to flash the wall just dying to a Cante way as well going to get knocked
3:06:02
back here a bit of damage here on a CU is this cassan Flash not necessarily that killable looking to uh threaten
3:06:10
them with some very tiny needles that is what Jin fires by the
3:06:16
way it's not actually he's just got to get them low enough and then the collector passive will take care of the rest FES you have to believe D just
3:06:25
forces two flashes there by himself in a 1 V3 um doesn't have to use his own sums
3:06:31
he's he's he's just fine he missed the cannon though does not bat well for his
3:06:36
mental as PDD what why are we going b as I want to
3:06:42
take I there's a lot there's a lot Happening Here Chon's going to
3:06:48
by the end of this series we have a second series today by the way as do he's two levels down he is Jin that was
3:06:53
a fourth shot by the way he's moving closer to the wall he's like please pull me over to the wall obviously he wants
3:07:00
to get closer to the karma which is really what he's thinking but like he puts himself in position to die to Cante
3:07:05
and have the flash yeah then the curtains are opened uh life is unimpressed just stands in
3:07:12
front DDD this is this is the type of game where I think you really you you you can't go defensive we
3:07:19
need you Full Burst okay I want to see death caps I want to see void staffs
3:07:25
Shadow flame I and I get it because there is a lot of skill shots which if they hit you they
3:07:32
just kill you right like there's cocoon there's the ult from piosik there is
3:07:38
Bulldog but you need a kill for your comp to work like cuz needs to get just
3:07:44
just one kill just one kill bro just it doesn't matter who it is just give him one bro one kill just please please just
3:07:53
one well they only have two so far so they're really asking for a lot you
3:07:59
know percentage wise as we are currently fighting for position to get Aon oh
3:08:06
scatter down scatter down bdd has to flash and it's just KT running away dnf
3:08:12
not able to secure much except some Summoners which is pretty big I mean they're going to get was Flash to get BD
3:08:18
flash he holds on to his banshe Veil for a little bit uh yeah the Banshees not
3:08:23
enough uh still has to invest a Summoner as we now have Dian freak just actually
3:08:28
moving like a team I feel like KT still feels so scatterbrained as perfect is on the
3:08:34
flank angle they don't have a sanial maybe this is the moment but they need to hit some
3:08:39
CC well any it's going to check the brush there with the deadly flourish uh again the pick comp of KT
3:08:47
they would like to get a pick to start this off one pick life what's going on
3:08:52
here oh wow oh I know about the ult yeah the was optimistic let's
3:09:02
say that's that's one of your big cool Downs uh-oh and now the big burst the
3:09:07
big boom boom damage coming out of the way but look at this dudo it's taking a huge amount of damage Jin can kill tanks
3:09:13
and he does it there he's not going to hit anything else but life might go down
3:09:18
he's going to taxi over to the minions but this is vgo we're talking about not really getting away from him and KT they
3:09:25
get a couple of picks they didn't get one they got two they doubled their kill score it works Val this the cup works
3:09:34
just one kill bro just one just one just one they get the one kill that's vicious
3:09:43
Aon that's that's sandals as well
3:09:48
wow KT rooster so we taking a look what happens to Dudu here I think it's just the
3:09:56
scatter yeah gets hit by the stun from C then gets hit by the scatter as well never after that doesn't get to W
3:10:03
doesn't get to doesn't get to flash and the cassan can't
3:10:08
die as the first member because the the rest of the team immediately has to see all space and also it means that cuz has
3:10:16
access to an ual tank and his resets pop up and now this is a 2minute period in
3:10:24
which DM freaks are not going to be able to contest I do want to highlight with wayy and the cadin like this is this is
3:10:31
still not enough by itself because the wave clear is so good getting CAU definely do it though oh life it's going
3:10:39
to flash out there's the meles as well I mean they have a lot of ways to get out of the engage of dnf really the gante is
3:10:46
the big problem he saw what happened to him in the last fight Dudu doesn't he he doesn't remember what happened in the
3:10:53
last fight he's going to continue running out them okay that should be a soulle point setup here for
3:11:00
KT and with how these fights have been playing out I'm feeling reasonably good
3:11:05
about a team being able to get good value out of that as Bulldog yeah unsurprisingly his poke has been hitting
3:11:11
the mark and that is what you're going to kind of hold on to as long as the baron isn't taking actually taking
3:11:18
objectives consistently is R look at the health from this mid lane turret by the way between the traps yeah and the wave
3:11:25
clear that bulock has available like both their outers are gone but as long as you can hold on to this mid lane turret you can really make your mark on
3:11:33
the map and as the gold lead is is good but
3:11:39
the N freaks are not out of this F as yeah I mean the Poke is coming in
3:11:44
from perfect who is threatening on the bottom side here 30 seconds on the buff
3:11:49
not really much of a turn angle onto the J just start Nash why are we siing his
3:11:55
midlan turret they have way and just you have to buff just started it Caitlyn
3:12:00
with five traps down flanking Jace is not the answer and okay well now the
3:12:06
buff the buff is going to time out yeah and Duck's pretty low okay nice pick there onto life and he is not able to go
3:12:13
up into the sky as now zero and three he looking for very optimistic cocoons just
3:12:20
kind of dying we don't know where the you know the gray screen is maybe it is in the sky I think it is yeah um yeah
3:12:27
life dies there unfortunately he is doing a great part of simulating one
3:12:32
part of Barrel's gam play but not the part where what about the barell still
3:12:38
wins the game but hey game's not over maybe he gets a big Kaka cuz that ends up winning in the game because I am a
3:12:45
little underwhelmed by the value that KT got it just feels like our lck teams
3:12:51
they saw the change and they're like you know what let's just treat it like getting gold like extra gold they
3:12:58
don't even get gold they did like did they get a single turret no
3:13:05
no no they didn't they got ocean Drake in the set up for soul point which admittedly is quite nice they got
3:13:11
Aon no but I mean what did they use the Aon for uh getting Aon yeah for getting
3:13:18
a they won the fight they won the fight that led to the Aon that gave them some gold it's
3:13:25
it's actually really nicely got him yeah look at Sani you can see that bdd
3:13:32
knows that this game isn't over yet and he did go void sta so heads off to bdd I knew I could trust you need as much
3:13:39
panish you can get so that we can one tap anyone on the enemy team through lock it which is always a bit tough due
3:13:45
to having seen what happened to him B time also has picked up a spirit vage so going to be pretty Juiced up when it
3:13:51
comes to the Mr yeah pretty good item in general for the Cante I think it's fine
3:13:56
to go third against the one AP source which is syndra yeah to sustain on your
3:14:02
Q benefits you have a single ocean Drake as well yeah not
3:14:07
bad and it's those type of picks that I think we need to see more of 4 KT it's
3:14:13
just it it it's what you were saying chronicler where it's like this game isn't over yet though you get so many Pi
3:14:18
onto El all you want you can get the one ocean Drake and it doesn't matter yet
3:14:25
even if you get soul I like again I think ocean soul is probably together with chch is is pretty low in terms of
3:14:33
impact is Doo what is going he's just running through the river he's got flash
3:14:39
s they're not actually damaging him wait but Jin was there he has a tank Buster
3:14:44
build chronicler telling me that Jin okay go go go Nash please please they
3:14:51
did the tank Buster build look at how low dudo is they did so
3:14:57
much B is level 16 um should be going death cap next I
3:15:04
imagine yeah I hope so Rand wins as oh yeah they're not they're not messing
3:15:09
around that's a Elixir Elixir coming through as well because this might be
3:15:14
where the game is decided KT going to be looking for the soul and yeah as I said even a weak ocean soul is still is still
3:15:21
dragon soul and dragon souls have an absolutely absurd win rate for a reason insanely strong per effect yeah he
3:15:26
doesn't really have to be afraid bdd he's just trying to have his presence be known no one gets to walk near a CH
3:15:34
point this is what I actually using the Benes offensively you know yeah it's
3:15:40
something is it enough we're about to see so I think if Dean freaks take a big
3:15:46
loss here game's going to be really hard to play out scatter down the tanks are
3:15:51
in fact tanking Dudu and piosik soaking up the damage and just trying to really bully
3:15:58
their way into this banana brush they need Vision if they want to try to contest over this ocean Drake is
3:16:04
actually not that bad little bit landing on the back line yeah it's it's it's not
3:16:09
terrible it's it's doing a little bit it has chipped away quite a couple of ticks of health
3:16:16
bar okay bdd again over the wall he is the crucial part of this composition his damage is what makes the
3:16:23
difference and they need to pick the set up ocean Rift actually doing a lot of work
3:16:29
there he's going to like get over the wall they need bdd here he's just not really here just yet as dudo is going in
3:16:35
they're going to look for cuz who ults away and now the flanking Syra is going
3:16:41
to land the stun onto multiable and there you go you have your pick but the turn does come in
3:16:47
is going to go down can anyone kill Dudu is the question I have they're trying to get duck on the backside B is so low
3:16:54
running away from Berserker who is going to get the kill and Dudu is still alive on the right side they got so though
3:17:02
they did get the soul and that is going to be huge and finally we know that vgo and Jace can eventually take out the
3:17:09
Cante and that they do so KT they stumble their way across the line and
3:17:15
they get an open soul they do not stumble they are dragged by bdd Bell that's the
3:17:21
flanking syndra and the the damage that comes in are UNCA and perfect enough
3:17:26
Flash and ult are used defensively and then the moment that bdd gets into the back you can see as well kind of the
3:17:33
chaos for DN fraks but I got to say if they just play forward they spotted bdd
3:17:39
on that Ward that was all the damage wasn't there so if they just play way more aggressive with the front line that
3:17:45
they have I think they can win win that fight they I mean Dudu did Dudu went in
3:17:51
by right idea by himself and he almost W V3 the rest of the team kind of just
3:17:57
like Pik tried to dash into syndra when there was a ball on the ground in front
3:18:02
of flash on perfect but he does have ocean like look at the healing yeah that's coming through on this guy Al
3:18:08
coming in letting him tank a lot they want the Jace I don't know if they can kill Jace I take back answer is no and
3:18:15
Dudu in a lot of trouble now the front lining ja they're trying to block for dooo but they can't they do not get the
3:18:21
block down and tnf are falling apart KT rooster a couple of huge picks and maybe
3:18:27
now finally they go for Baron I'm taking back my ocean soul slander
3:18:33
perfect you have you have shown me the error of my ways I should have believed
3:18:39
in the pristine ocean as he tanks so much there completely
3:18:46
unbothered what was it like two free ultimates yeah went into the Jace didn't
3:18:52
matter that's Nash and now lit in a purple glow I think KT have
3:18:59
done it VES it was a very KT fashion yeah and we said you know if this game
3:19:05
goes long enough it should go to dnf but it just feels like unfortunately for their
3:19:11
sake uh they weren't quite able to make as many grounds it doesn't matter it
3:19:16
it's fine perhaps we thought they were going to and now KT getting a big enough
3:19:21
lead especially with the ocean soul almost 10,000 gold ahead and we'll see
3:19:28
this play once again into perfect it is a bit staggered I'd say yeah the fact he goes back in as well then they have him
3:19:35
tank the ultimate then there is the the spare as well and it just shrugs it off
3:19:41
and then OB these the counter Gates is really nice here this is a great scenario for Jin Berserker doesn't
3:19:47
really get to walk up there because he would get targeted just get taken down klin really is relying on our PR line
3:19:53
and we now got to the point where due to the effect these longer fights KT is just sustaining up they can
3:19:59
actually get through the health bars on these tanks death Gap almost done for
3:20:06
bdd and DN freaks they're going to need a miracle fight backline
3:20:12
AIS blow someone up ideally bdd even do d in a
3:20:17
pinch but going to be hard The Kills Redemption heal all
3:20:23
available all right stun on the Theo route comes down just trying to Siege
3:20:29
this turret right now they still have a minute and 20 left on the baron trying to do as much as they possibly can with
3:20:34
it as cuz going to let that one hit duck do that's just fine bdd think about a
3:20:41
little rotation over towards Dudu this one V one will never end
3:20:47
but yeah just trying to see trying to get as much value as you can might just end up being a little Elder flip moment
3:20:53
in this game if KT can't get enough with this Baron that is a good way back in
3:20:58
actually poik stealing an elder bug that could do
3:21:03
it yeah shouldn't get the opportunity though because this is the scenario that we talked about this com from KT if you
3:21:10
are behind or if you are a head rder if the enemy is behind don't have any map control uh playing the game going very
3:21:16
tough as life still hasn't found the Cocoon to get the back in yeah no
3:21:23
cocoon not too much hope left for them but again no inhibitor turrets go down
3:21:30
like not even the turrets themselves Elder flip I mean this the series does feel
3:21:36
very Challengers baby you know okay but the I do now think like KT they're going to have death cap it's a 10k gold
3:21:44
deficit they should they should realistic to bully them away always be
3:21:49
able to bully away uh BD actually doesn't have his death cap yet do see the pot also bought for
3:21:56
Doom perfect now has both forn mail and randin I'm going to check the damage
3:22:04
numers off so as thanky production 800 gold still left for bdd so uh might actually be tough to hit it
3:22:11
we have TP available though so might be able to TP back in uh uh
3:22:17
well he's going to go very deep for that kill I don't know about that one cuz and now no reset comes in Duck do no the FL
3:22:24
fourth shot just like that to the face and now with Berserker gone you don't have enough damage Bulldog is being
3:22:31
bullied away it looks like KT finally did it we're not going to have any Elder flips no Challengers here it's just
3:22:38
straight up ltk cup KT rolster looks like they have finally done it as they
3:22:44
will look to push to end right down the middle of the map and it's so KT to still be like are they really going to
3:22:50
do it are they really going to win is it enough I don't know I think it's enough at this point
3:22:57
as uh we're going to get some shots on in popping over he's going to flash away
3:23:04
safe to say the Elise from Life maybe we don't get to see it again here at the
3:23:09
lck cup if they do make it into play we'll have to wait and see on that one as well Katy roller take the victory
3:23:17
off of the backs of a very interesting piit comp that they forc to work with
3:23:23
some fun engages and vision denial and Dian fraks were not quite up to The Challenge on this one see the
3:23:31
handshake I what even hit Berserker at first at the end of that uh I'm pretty
3:23:37
sure it was actually a Jin Auto cuz as much fun as we poked at dock for you
3:23:43
know the initial build I do think that he course corrected nice and the damage to squishies still very
3:23:50
much where it needs to be uh KT get the 2-1 Victory and I I I
3:23:58
do love to see that perfect going back to like when they locked in the gragas and he was just
3:24:04
like oh my God guys I had such a like I was worried but I think he did actually have a great game number two and three
3:24:12
piosik unfortunately we know how emotive of a player he is and did not end up
3:24:17
getting the win here today which means for the DN freaks that they are now
3:24:23
going to be ried on bnk so this is a really big deal if bnk get the win against Nim it would mean that DN freaks
3:24:30
actually just straight up are eliminated no chance to fight through playin no chance to further improve and no chance
3:24:39
to make a Deep Run in the SK cup yeah it wouldn't feel very good to be denied a chance you know at at least
3:24:46
to make it through plays to make it into playoffs it's it's not an easy
3:24:51
tournament this lck cup but KT rollster will be moving on up and curious about
3:24:59
this team because theyve certainly had their up and downs so far in their first
3:25:05
five games of the cup to say the least starting off with this dive which wasn't clean but as you mentioned you know you
3:25:11
get first blood on your vgo deny some uh some experience from
3:25:18
Dudu and this is the moment mind control them to face check the brush yeah DM
3:25:24
freak is going to go back to this cuz this is this feels like it really sets
3:25:29
up a lot of what happens later on like specifically just a little bit of extra gold into these reset
3:25:35
Champions moments like this where KT fans I imagine were absolutely terrified
3:25:41
and justly so because this was a this was not a clean game
3:25:46
and this was the breaking point where bdd finds the big scatter on his syndra one of his and we keep going back to
3:25:53
like BD's iconic Champions because he's been playing for so long he has so many but a Syra is definitely up there his
3:25:59
scatters were the Difference Maker for me and once those resets com through we do see cuz be able to have an absolutely
3:26:06
immense impact on one of his most comfortable champions in that vgo and this is Anum they I I still think they
3:26:12
could have done it if they just push aggressively forward here and don't relent it's hard though uh cuz
3:26:19
up until that point they don't know where bdd is we have perfect vision they do not I think the D and freaks in that
3:26:25
moment that maybe was the one out I didn't quite find it I want to again see what happens I think it is just yeah
3:26:32
that was that was a little bit dangerous for
3:26:39
him but you can see the Shields coming in and then dck eventually just flash might even be that uh the vision
3:26:46
there was also because the the came through because there wasn't any awards or it was someone just around the bend
3:26:52
there really sure the moment that kin's gone know that the game is done really
3:27:01
big win for them here ensuring that they stay ahead of no and giving the opportunity to catch up with
3:27:08
DRX yeah and we'll see how that all ends up we will find out in the last 3 days
3:27:14
of the lck cup including today in the next couple of days there wasn't ever
3:27:19
really a time actually if you look at the Gold graph where dnf had any much of
3:27:25
a gold lead none actually that doesn't happen often it's just zero yeah you know what like the upper a
3:27:32
little piece of dust on the monitor I thought was like a tiny little lump there but no and uh does this surprise
3:27:39
you at all bdd does pick up the player of the match yeah I I voted bdd which
3:27:45
should come as a as a no-brainer who else do you vote for well that's that's my my question I
3:27:51
don't I I don't I don't know I'm not sure um J son said the Eiffel something
3:27:57
oh Eiffel 65 could have voted for them yeah I actually didn't see the angle for
3:28:02
that one that's on me I think this is 11 out of 11 uh I would
3:28:08
imagine but guys we do have the interview and we will see indeed let's jump over to the interview right now and
3:28:15
find out what BD has to say after this big
3:28:20
win thank you very much guys this is dear for the LC cup pom interview
3:28:26
translation joined by bdd on the side of KT
3:28:31
rollster hello BD hello we talk to you right before the
3:28:40
holiday for that pom interview and you got another one again today
3:28:46
and it was a must-win series today and you posted out uh pretty well despite it
3:28:52
being an intense match how do you feel you know I think we were able to
3:28:58
have a good break uh and also good opportunity to actually be able to refine our performance so it was it was
3:29:06
great it was a good win so what were you trying to attempt to do during the draft in games two and
3:29:13
three after all the target ban mid I think we were just trying to go over
3:29:21
all the available options and I think we were able to optimize our picks in the end and in game three we got one of your
3:29:27
classic picks syndra so how did it play out for you you know I ended up playing
3:29:35
cnra um just based on the enemy comp and I think it just ended up working out
3:29:40
because the enemy comp didn't really have anyone that was too tanky
3:29:46
and so showmaker also happens to like cnra so would you like to sell out to encourage her use on stage you know to
3:29:52
be honest she's not that good how would you rate your own
3:29:59
performance today no I didn't think I made too many
3:30:04
mistakes uh particularly so I think it was not bad and it looks like every time KT wins
3:30:12
you get nominated to be the p
3:30:18
so we actually prepared a few comments by the analysts and the and the
3:30:23
commentators so let's go over those it looks like goo said I want to
3:30:30
be BD's air soldiers and helos also said how much more can he
3:30:37
offer there's also Cloud Templar who said where's my diaper oh yeah I thought
3:30:43
Cloud templar's comment was the funny
3:30:50
so now you have secured a spot in the play so far so what will you work on
3:30:56
improving until then first of all there are so many good
3:31:02
teams so I feel like with our performance today I don't
3:31:08
think we'll be able to win against stronger team so I think we all have a lot to work
3:31:14
on congratul ation again and that's the end of the interview with bdd and back to the space thank
3:31:22
you thank you very much dear aaya as it is a 21 Victory here for KT another ride
3:31:29
on the roller coaster of the roster but it shows up Victorious this time in a
3:31:34
game that they very much needed to secure their spot definitely in plays uh
3:31:39
space one last time here Deon alongside with did and wolf anous all right we did it we were worried that wolf was going
3:31:46
to get mad and have to call people out for voting a certain way but instead everyone knew bdd was the guy yeah I
3:31:53
mean I didn't know cnra could Flank In the team fight you know I never seen the
3:31:58
cnra once again I mean he T he got Target banned like so many times in this series as well like uh so it's just
3:32:06
impressive like another game by bdd yeah I mean I just feel like bdd is doing so much heavy lifting for this team right
3:32:12
now he's dragging them across the Finish Line in so many of these Series so guy deserves the credit he's getting right
3:32:17
now I think he's actually now P leader across the tournament yeah all right comment time one of our favorite new
3:32:23
additions in 2025 what did the novelist said do you really think you could stop
3:32:28
me with those bands cuz he took so many of them yeah I mean the TF was not really popping off but you know you got
3:32:35
to give credit for his large huge uh tremendous champion pool like by bdd uh
3:32:42
once again it's only bo3 but it's going to be a banger in B5 large huge
3:32:50
tremendous massive Global Oceanic yes exactly um I I went a
3:32:57
little bit more around bdd syndra you can't find bdd syndra at the department
3:33:03
store you got to go to that B1 Vantage shop you got to go down it's dark find
3:33:09
the bdd classic friends like hey where'd you get that cindry like oh you can't buy it at the store only I have it um
3:33:15
and that's only have it here at the lck cup you can't get this syndra in LEC you can't find this syndra lpo never you
3:33:21
know you think you're going to find this in Oceania I don't think so no need to
3:33:26
no need to pair it with engage you've just got the bdd class LTA
3:33:32
oh what about showmaker Sentra that's S I mean not it's not the same it's a
3:33:38
knockoff brand wow he's a new breand he better in some ways and worse in others
3:33:44
let's see what else who else what else do we got here in terms of our comments there's cronnie as inevitable as the sun
3:33:50
the moon and the tide I don't this this comment scares me it makes like the sun's not come up tomorrow cuz we only
3:33:56
get like BD syndra like once a year since 2021 so Chron is making me a
3:34:01
little bit worried the the end of the world may be coming soon I mean it's definitely a last game
3:34:07
of TF I could definitely see that yeah ghost TF no TP uh we'll see Korean side
3:34:14
here we go Helios here one moment gone the next bdd the C Robin this is so good
3:34:21
this one is the best one he's on point he's on point all right and I think so many
3:34:27
meanings in this one yeah we you could go a lot of places that one I I don't know here's the last one for those of
3:34:33
you that watch culinary War it's me bdd that's pretty good yeah I mean you you
3:34:39
cannot explain KT without bdd you know he it's him KT is him basically yeah
3:34:45
right now he is the guy I mean the guy for KT yeah they're they're still looking for some others but uh bdd is
3:34:53
the guy right now as they take the victory here let's take a look at the highlights from that last game and we got to go all the way at 24 minutes
3:35:00
because there was again lack of engage on these comps and bdd starts this one off by alting an Elise I mean once again
3:35:07
like I really didn't see the uh Mastery on that champion from uh live he was on
3:35:13
El leise but he didn't even try once with his cocoon flash so that's why they
3:35:19
were kind of lack of engage and also bdd was really just focusing on life like all the time so that's why they really
3:35:26
like couldn't find out the engage moment for the for the team fight I lot of this team fight for me me it was it was slow
3:35:32
but it was it was really methodical here by KT rollster to eventually take the tank out chronicler pointed out that
3:35:37
just destroys the entire comp but one other thing I really noticed in this fight is just dfn don't seem like they
3:35:43
trust each other in some of these team fights like berserker's not given the space to actually do that damage on Caitlyn and they're kind of stuck in
3:35:49
this fight where they're not able to wrap around the wall to get on top of KT without coughing enough to burn dragon and they're kind of just sitting around
3:35:56
waiting for something to happen and then KT just slowly burned them to death yeah definitely I and also again the
3:36:01
broadcast called it out the tank Buster gin build that was there it did it did a
3:36:07
little bit of work there as Dudu got blown up pretty early on on Cante and then here at 33 minutes this was the
3:36:13
final fight before dnf ran out opportunities yeah I mean uh the fight
3:36:20
again I think they had they used really well around the karma uh they didn't have engage tool but at the same time
3:36:26
they had some utilities to walk around you have Kama Shields and also you have
3:36:31
J's uh gate to have a extra movement speed as well and also you have Jean's
3:36:37
ultimate to kind of engage with the long range I think they understand what their
3:36:43
comp can do uh in this kind of team fight and I think that really worked out well with their uh play style I think in
3:36:50
order for the comp to work better for dfn they needed to play around life's cocoons like you said a little bit more they didn't really try to utilize that
3:36:56
the Sani ultimate had some Synergy there tried to play a bursty style didn't opt for like going for leandri for example
3:37:02
on the way which would have given them more slower team fight damage if they wanted to play it slow like they did and
3:37:07
uh yeah I think they need to go back to the drawing board a little bit here there's a lot to unpack yeah basically it's all about knowing your Champions
3:37:14
limit you know if life knew his Champions limit well then we could see more creativity from his pick but as you
3:37:21
mentioned there was a Synergy between Sani as well but we didn't see that from this game all right well dnf now they've
3:37:27
got no more games to play they only can sit back and watch as we take a look at the standings they are not out as again
3:37:35
they hold the lead over bnk FX but their only hope now is uh uh has to has to to
3:37:43
lose otherwise like they will pass them and then obviously bro could also lose and then they would be tied at one and
3:37:49
four negtive 5 if Bros is two Z as a lot of people expect 2D plus but like it's
3:37:55
really really scary if bnk wins and then you're like fate is in Bros hands Etc yeah and also when you remember uh week
3:38:01
one of the lck cup DNK dnf was their last hope for group Baron but now
3:38:08
they're on a really choke point yeah they're going to be fans of Nong shim on that Sunday night match that's going to
3:38:15
be whether they play more matches here in the lck cup or they don't get to play a competitive match until April brutal
3:38:23
is the format but that's the way it goes everyone knew how it went all right we're not done yet here on Friday's
3:38:29
matches as we have Hana life Esports up against DRX DRX with an opportunity to lock in that playoff spot Comm life
3:38:36
Esports trying to bounce back from a slow start in the LC cup we'll have that match for you after the short break

3:56:35
hiigh
3:56:43
f wo hello and welcome back to the lck cup
3:56:48
this is the second series of the night hanal life Esports up against DRX and
3:56:54
this one on paper it feels a little bit more one-sided but DRX have just been getting wins here in there UK's been
3:57:01
carrying quite hard and they have been playing up against um Team Baron I
3:57:07
believe they're free and one so they're just winning a lot they're threee and one and they're good I guess
3:57:14
but I don't think a lot of people expected them to be good A lot of these series have been very up and down there
3:57:21
was one thing though that everyone can agree on and that's that ukel has been playing out of his mind and want to
3:57:29
highlight as well I think that lazy F had been doing an admirable job holding down the fort Force up particularly with
3:57:35
the pressure that was on him even though it's not really in the LSK he's still playing against LSK teams so being able
3:57:40
to perform the way he did look at that look at that thex they do have three wins
3:57:48
and uh now most likely if they lose against Tom wer are they going to drop to Fourth yes doesn't matter so
3:57:54
important things to look at here doesn't matter still winning they have locked in a playin spot and that is what they have
3:58:01
locked in so far right so uh you can get a playoff spot which jeni and DK have um
3:58:10
the teams on the left there bro they also have a playing spot and that means that Deon will be very happy for now as
3:58:18
we compare mechanics to potential uh what will it take to win as
3:58:24
we get towards the end of the groups battle humble life on a 10 match win streak unsurprisingly but DRX advances
3:58:30
to the playoffs upon Victory now would be absolutely Monumental if they can do it here G today not expected obviously
3:58:38
but Hana have not looked nearly as dominant as many of us were expecting
3:58:44
they just kind of all over the place yeah I think that Helma life from Baron and jingi from uh Elder have been the
3:58:51
teams that we expected to be extremely good and extremely dominant and they haven't really hit that Mark they
3:58:58
haven't been clean at least they've been good by the way Teddy is coming back
3:59:03
today and we got fans from Houston we got fans from Kentucky for teddy as you can see there
3:59:10
the teddy bears and obviously the teddy written there so lots of people coming
3:59:16
down to watch Teddy's return I'm just glad that he's healthy and that he's back who will win a Super team with a
3:59:24
two-time world champion winning substitute coming in right Z is replacing Doran was the biggest news to
3:59:30
the off season multiple world champions on this roster the orange tank or SpongeBob and his buddies that's what
3:59:39
we're say there is the faker of HS there is ukel coming back from the the human
3:59:44
Nexus back at it again and what a fight it would be if DRX actually bring us the
3:59:51
distance here and we're building it up because realistically even with Teddy coming back I do actually think that
3:59:57
lazy field had a great time I don't think that alone is going to be enough
4:00:02
we need to see a real step up when it comes to particularly the team performance of thex cuz even though feel
4:00:09
like combo haven't really been in the same page I don't know if RX can make use of
4:00:15
that space that has been given as this man definitely the most talked about move of the offseason so far it feels
4:00:22
like both T1 and him are still finding their footings without one another he
4:00:28
feels very out of place which I think is to be expected in a way it take time
4:00:34
yeah it it'll take time when you play with the same roster when you debut with the the same roster that you played with
4:00:39
for all that time and you only know one roster and one shot caller and you know one system and then you have to make a
4:00:46
huge change right and I think zos has been doing that and it's been showing that he has been struggling uh we know
4:00:53
he's still a good player form is temporary and I think once he gets online and once this orange tank all
4:00:59
comes together all the pieces come together they're obviously going to be a strong team and they are a strong team
4:01:04
they've only lost to gen G but we'll see their true potential at that time I think as
4:01:12
Viper sniffling a little but hope he's okay as well it is a bit of flu season
4:01:18
over here so we get the zoom in on the hands of the human Nexus Teddy is back looking good as well
4:01:26
happy to see Teddy back as good of a job as lazy field it considering the circumstances always going to feel
4:01:33
really good to have our the player back at Lark ready to perform here today and
4:01:40
going to have to step up here today if they want to get even a single game in I think would actually be a big deal KT is
4:01:47
currently sitting at a plus one score so if DRX lose two to one I think uh
4:01:54
actually that still wouldn't be enough cuz they would still go down so I guess they have to win which does make the
4:01:59
whole equation a lot harder just win just win you get that higher seed on
4:02:05
paper FAS this one seems like a no-brainer but I got a feeling that it's
4:02:10
going to be a good time but I don't know for which team
4:02:16
yeah that's scary look at these scores 3 to one 2 to2
4:02:21
obviously yeah I actually forgot that H life also lost to DK that makes a lot of sense um especially because DK is
4:02:28
undefeated um that's not real that's not actually I I so
4:02:33
DRX they have blue side blue side has been pretty strong here at the lck can
4:02:39
they start off with a quick Victory catching halalay Sports off guard what
4:02:45
is zukal going to play Santa taken away Jace probably the highest PR pick
4:02:53
that is still open barison Ash also both there VI on the one that I would not be
4:03:00
surprised to see Sponge pick up early sponge really still embracing as the
4:03:07
band does come through the Challenger in that some of his games looks incredible and then other games just kind of dies a
4:03:13
lot you know which game he had trouble on uh which champ Pantheon a lot of our junglers have been
4:03:19
struggling you know what he looked great on was nly which I that's still out of
4:03:25
any jungler the fact that sponge has actually been making the nly work and the team has been playing around it well
4:03:31
has kind of blown my mind cuz you know nle is notoriously one of the hardest Champs to execute and sponge again has
4:03:38
had great moments but not consistently but the nle has actually looked good also feel like this should
4:03:44
necessitate a pick away of some of the 80 Ms obviously the Y is already taken
4:03:50
away that's the big one but even Jace could theoretically be flexed so I think taking that early on
4:03:57
definitely a big win and also say he's the the lightning guy Jay is one of his
4:04:03
most iconic Champions and the champion right now is ABS Surly strong it's very good it it doesn't lose
4:04:10
Lane to anything it's super tanky and does damage it's just one of those Champs that lck
4:04:16
teams will love and not just lck teams but teams around the world uh because
4:04:21
it's just so reliable it's hard to lose with it and ambessa was the next uh the
4:04:28
next choice on the list maybe you could have thought about a rumble but not wanting to play that one and the Leona
4:04:35
will also be locked in here for on Leona prio provides good setup that
4:04:41
you really do need even ambessa I think funly enough can feel somewhat rying on setup because of how much of her kid in
4:04:48
team fights at least relies on getting an old off with n goes without saying as well as it's Sani here coming through
4:04:56
for peanut I was kind of expecting them to also go for a support lock in cuz now DRX have plenty of opportunities to bend
4:05:01
away some of those what this does do is it also kind of hides where everything is going we don't really know what's
4:05:07
going to happen with the jce again most likely going to go to Zas we'll see what DRX thinks of this now ad car pool can
4:05:15
get further finned out but this game one so I don't know how much you really want to do maybe just bend the sreal leave it
4:05:23
at that yeah I think the SRE is a good shout take that one away you B Rada if
4:05:30
you DRX Ferris Rada is a very uh very uninteractive
4:05:40
Lane re okay the re got going to come out here the denying Delight is like ra
4:05:46
raon maybe and and besta was picked and Rumble follow up B here maybe not
4:05:54
trusting cuz there there is still the opportunity here for DRX to do some flexing as well yeah could even go
4:06:02
towards something like the zigs just try and neutralize the lane completely if you pick up another 80 top laner you
4:06:07
flex and B side of the mid I'm pretty sure ukel was the first guy that did it and I guess the raan leaving it open Mak
4:06:13
sense given that you are playing Lea into it which I don't think is as much of a counter as it was but it is still
4:06:19
solid zir taken away from Z and Zea has been fine I think this season but if you
4:06:25
ask me right now who I think the better mid is it's probably youal yeah right
4:06:31
now at this point in time it's definitely it has to be right sure he's been performing thus far I I do think
4:06:37
that he hasn't really been tested just yet to be honest I do think that group
4:06:42
Baron was pretty weak overall well cuz UK's not in it he can't play against
4:06:47
himself exactly it's just it's just ash kind of a no-brainer interesting to see that it
4:06:54
makes it this far for the draft and what is the actual setup going to
4:06:59
be no no no no no no no no I know it won twice I know we doubled the wins we're
4:07:04
on a winning streak this can't be the answer you guys two in a row no yeah the guy who got multiple stolen
4:07:13
Nico fiveman knockups in team fights is now going to be playing Corky Camille
4:07:20
gets locked in oh God so that's going Top Lane against the the Amba so instead
4:07:27
of picking any setup for an naly we pick Cory with it so now our mid jungle 2v2 is quite bad and then we get the last
4:07:37
minute switcher Z in fact not playing one of his most ionic Champions but
4:07:42
instead switching to one which we also have seen in Pilot with great success to Camille Camille and sidani absolutely
4:07:49
disgusting 2v2 and zaka can go tank Jace into the corki corki hasn't really been able to
4:07:57
do what do you mean he's on a winning streak the only wins were ad Cary vales it was ruler and it was Berserker yeah
4:08:05
but but they still count Cory mid it's just not it doesn't spark Joy no I'm not
4:08:13
feeling it it doesn't yeah I don't know I especially when it's youal I mean this guy he's
4:08:19
single-handedly carrying this team with Playmakers right and then you put them on Corky is a decision that's not a
4:08:26
playmaking champion the rest of the team has set up Leona has enough CC for every
4:08:32
I I just I look at this composition as this looks beautiful the only downside is no a damage so maybe there's an angle
4:08:39
there but I have to see it before I believe it B does yeah well let's do it
4:08:44
let's hop on the rift for game number [Music]
4:09:03
one Camille is so tall like that was scary just a giant like half her legs
4:09:11
are blades as well that freaked me out
4:09:17
um I'm glad you're ready for this for this series that first one really prepped you yeah did put your mind in
4:09:23
the right spot you know I I really like the Zoom inss that we get over here at the lck and uh you know I I I wasn't
4:09:32
looking at that time but yes Camille is very tall and very
4:09:39
sharp and some of the best top laners have play play this Z bin they make it
4:09:46
look broken it can be pretty difficult there was a time you know way back when Camille first came out that it was Perma
4:09:53
pick ban because it was played jungle and top because you could AOE with your
4:09:59
hook shot my God I yeah and know I also remember the like that was back when you had level two Krabby and you had like
4:10:05
the level two oh oh like that oh okay like that like that
4:10:11
cool yeah uh this is also why particularly when bloodsong was really strong last year we had a brief period
4:10:18
where Camille support was a thing uh cuz you go Halo blades and you go blood song and then yeah Rich is actually going to
4:10:24
get a good amount of experience is it worth it yes uh I'm going to say yes what do you
4:10:31
think is it I don't know I'm not I'm not so sure that sounds that sounds like a no
4:10:38
depends on whether he gets Dove which I think he does have a little bit of Defense Vision so we should know when
4:10:45
this is happening they have a ward on the Raptors so unfortunately foras he's
4:10:50
getting pul but did actually get a good amount of XP himself and we have andil making his way over now let's take a
4:10:57
look at the path that Pina takes here because this top side play might just be a ro otherwise it looks like Ando does
4:11:03
not have to cover for any dive so it's just going to be Teddy against Zas which
4:11:08
Z doesn't know this just yet but I'm sure it'll be clued in momentarily but so you know he's playing it Ash Ash is
4:11:15
one of those Champions that just kind of seems like a nightmare to play in the 1 V one unless your jungler shows up but
4:11:21
penut is paing towards the B side and Dix should know this so realistically Teddy should be able to
4:11:27
get the crash and then piece out which is exactly what he's doing you'll love to see it is possible angle here towards
4:11:34
the top side maybe Rich needs to make sure to sell this do not look oh there
4:11:39
we go just run straight at them they got the flash out of a delight so that's
4:11:45
something but VI was able to walk it off no hex flash so actual flash cool down
4:11:51
that's a win huh I didn't catch his Rune set just
4:11:57
not good because you go domination with the new runes right yeah probably when deep Ward and yeah I know either cheap
4:12:04
shot or uh yeah I imagine should be cheap shoted fory get a good amount of value out of
4:12:10
that yeah makes sense no X flash though so uh Atlas somewhere uh is crying
4:12:18
watching at home sorry Atlas um the value not not seen I am curious how UK
4:12:25
is going to do on the Corky you know we weren't exactly very happy to see it and we like to see him on Playmakers because
4:12:32
that's what we've seen so far but maybe he's just really really strong at anything and maybe he's going to play a
4:12:39
sick Corky game it's not very exciting and obviously it's 2 and 12 so nobody actually um has seen a lot of
4:12:47
potential so we look at this and we're like well it's obviously not going to do well because history teaches us that
4:12:52
well it's just not winning but uh I'm curious to see if he can actually make it
4:12:58
work and with these swaps we'll have to see whether Rich can
4:13:04
also kind of dig himself out because he even though he didn't get Dove still didn't get nearly as much yes as z z
4:13:12
also has just been here in the B side the whole time whereas Rich needed some time and now he's
4:13:18
getting pummeled like these really trades with K are super aggressive and as you said vas we'll see
4:13:23
ucal maybe we were wrong on Corky and it was just really unlucky 12 games in a
4:13:30
row you know we we can't know these things for sure we have a suspicion that's why we
4:13:36
needed more than 12 games then game 13 and 14 really that's where you begin
4:13:41
they did and they did game 13 14 did throw us up cuz he won twice yeah corki mid though still without to win and
4:13:48
guess what yeah if you the first that'd be very impressive that
4:13:54
would be really cool that would be a really cool for us to witness today and have happen look at that zero gold
4:14:00
difference between the junglers just observing all kinds of wonderful things they us this is a lot of really cool
4:14:06
things happening on the rift today that's not good though if you're nly you really to kind on P
4:14:14
but uh he ganked top right so sense he was there he took a little bit of time
4:14:19
to do exactly that and you know maybe he can gank once again they do have Ash and
4:14:26
Leona in that lane so you're talking about you know the one lane of the setup that is it so if you're n maybe you just
4:14:33
hover around there we do have the grubs oh Rich I'm like he doesn't have TP but
4:14:38
what if we just rotate him over I don't think this supposed to call I what we just R really slow like Z is level six
4:14:45
as well okay okay you know what could have made that decision earlier it's
4:14:51
better than the alternative where they just go and watch now they get a shove in and then say TPS and then you have a
4:14:57
timer where I I he might not even have to TP actually cuz we were too slow yeah
4:15:04
now he might just get it on the crash I I'm if there's a cannon in there as well he's even going to miss
4:15:10
anything a no he's not going to miss anything so zus runs up they get all the
4:15:18
grubs and then he runs down and misses nothing we have a little fake dive here
4:15:23
I think they probably would have gone for it if Hondo wasn't there but hey there we go that's a win get the
4:15:30
dragon yeah early ocean Drake not bad can be a lot of uh oppressive Lanes when
4:15:36
you're dealing with into melee and then you've got Jace as well so early
4:15:41
individual ocean Drake is yeah actually quite nice uh Rich did run around and Z didn't give anything up so unfortunately
4:15:49
his struggles do continue but he's got an ocean Drake now
4:15:54
yeah but it doesn't give him back gold or XP no it doesn't do that he he
4:16:01
was level five when he was running up so sponge uh misses a spear on
4:16:08
kugs yeah it's that kind of game isn't it not again we already had those
4:16:13
earlier Val it it feels kind of weird but like I don't know what happens but now
4:16:21
we've come into this new patch and all of a sudden we're getting old lck back was it really just the fact that
4:16:28
first blood was valuable plus the ocon buff being completely Bon cursed that they
4:16:33
did I think so because I I was going to say you know like the oton it just feels
4:16:39
like now teams are valuing it a whole lot less for a good reason right you're giving double gold and the first
4:16:46
blood is it just doesn't matter as much as they're trying to get on top of peanut here PE was the one trying to
4:16:52
dive them but he went a bit early there's the alt into Leona Andel has Eclipse up but now the fire with the
4:16:58
chains and there you go Viper going to set that one up picks up first blood for himself and Corky for the win the
4:17:06
flanking Corky the failed knockup the combo comes in the Splash in front by
4:17:11
Sponge and now you call is going 1 V4 and he's going to get stunned eventually
4:17:17
right okay maybe not oh he gets stunned into the wall and just dies well it turns out that cork is not a playmaker
4:17:23
especially when it shows up 40 minutes late to the party and how life Esports
4:17:29
will get the three kills and they get the feat of strength Yow you were the
4:17:34
chosen one you were supposed to do the
4:17:40
thing yeah you know imagine if he's like azir there I know air was ban but like
4:17:46
I'm just cnra yeah anything even cnra as we take another look here so onale feels
4:17:51
confident but it doesn't actually get his Aftershock uh just have the Eclipse which yeah yeah it really and even if he
4:17:58
had both I don't think that would have been enough and then this is crucial here is that Teddy is just taken out of the fight immediately actually really
4:18:05
well played there by the rest of hanwa and then here like Viper actually cuz he
4:18:10
goes for the flesh Q uh flash but he flashes behind so that he knocks him
4:18:15
back into his own team so it makes the followup really easy just really cleanly done here by Han live and the game's
4:18:22
just kind of done which I I I I hope that's not actually what happens but
4:18:28
this is a 2 and2 K gold lead at at 10 minutes fell this okay but one thing we can look forward to is a totally useless
4:18:34
Aon from M that's the new change from the patch
4:18:41
that can help us unfortunately not like not like this
4:18:46
what we've seen is that the they get the Aon and then they don't do anything with it but they still win the game anyway
4:18:51
so it doesn't actually help you can't let us be right UK you've been playing so well don't let the annoying know it
4:18:57
all cost us be right prove us wrong we know nothing actually we are so dumb I I
4:19:02
but I want to be proven wrong I want to see what every coach and every player is seeing
4:19:09
valz I mean you kind of already said it though like this this one's kind of I
4:19:14
don't know well it's not done it's fine it's not it's not okay there's bounties they can get the bounties uh they're
4:19:20
fing for grubs we the dness of this game
4:19:25
yeah we got a fight that Al's going to miss it's going to slow at least Zea he's just hopping on in he's so tanky as
4:19:32
will they even take him out they finally do but this fight is going the way of h b Sports still a massive spear goes in Z
4:19:39
though going to land this stun no followup though as like Viper was kind of One V oneing maybe andil on the top
4:19:45
of the fight and now looking to back away from this one H life Esports would love to get at least one grub okay Spong
4:19:53
is healing he is smites that one no Smite
4:19:58
for peanut and everything's missing Delight is's okay TPS are coming in double TP
4:20:06
Delight getting pretty low we're going in they're trying to get on top of Viper here and now the Jace is back and rich
4:20:11
is trying to take away the Sani he will be able to and now zeka's going to miss the shock blast he's on the run and he
4:20:18
is super fast but wow DRX okay take take
4:20:24
that cers what do you know game's not over uh I'd love to see a replay of the
4:20:31
whole sequence because uh there was a lot lot going on there but they got the
4:20:37
bounty on viper they got kills on Sponge so we go all the way back uh peanut
4:20:43
unfortunately misses there then Zea goes into M people and they do get Teddy but he actually gets a lot of damage done
4:20:49
then Rich uh tries to go for the El to kind of save himself but Za already has the channel and then Za there goes in on
4:20:56
Sponge and he definitely could have killed him but instead uh he just dies rest of the team is like ah we're pcing
4:21:01
out and then here unironically the Cori actually gets do so much damage right
4:21:07
cuz he just gets the Auto fire away fire away and in these early skirmishes I feel the N especially with blue like you
4:21:14
get so many heals of that's like a couple of hundred extra Health that DRX had to their uh
4:21:21
um uh had there to use I don't yeah look at that oh back in gameplay
4:21:28
territory yeah we are it is doable for either team at this
4:21:34
point it does look like H Sports should be able to group up and take this Dragon I am curious to see what kind of dragon
4:21:41
soul we get in this one as we had a couple of hexx and an ocean in the last
4:21:47
one uh turns out that Jace is pretty strong not just into Top Lane Champions
4:21:54
but also into Corky without any items so UK just kind of takes a beating I don't
4:21:59
think he was picking corki to trade against uh Jace he didn't even know he was Ling into Jace until they saw the
4:22:06
Camille but that's just the way that one is going to go Jayce very playable obviously in this MCH match up pretty
4:22:13
much any match up yeah that really is a problem Champion right now is just insanely
4:22:20
strong with the showing of poppy towards the top side of the map we do have sponge going and then as soon as they
4:22:25
are vacating he will do so as well I'm going to run the risk even with LeAndre sponge if sponge dies this game becomes
4:22:32
well it's already hard but then you go from normal heart to like from software hard uh because he's the one with the
4:22:39
shutdown he's the one as a sole IP source that really just keep going yeah what's that it's
4:22:46
from uh Dark Souls and elen ring and oh right okay yeah well I know those games
4:22:51
I just into the oh develop yeah well Rich you you can't Dash away from that
4:22:57
that's one thing that cam is very good at doing pressing the R button on the
4:23:03
ambessa so rich goes down my guess is that rich thought that they'd rotated down uh because zus and Delight both
4:23:11
were shadowing towards the river so most likely father that they actually left then unfortunately quick we found out
4:23:17
that that was not the case and yeah the amount of combin CC probably would have been uh enough but then also the cam Al
4:23:23
as you point out no shot of getting out of that one and that's the first tur blood and the sandals have now made
4:23:30
their way towards hwa and and I know that the 2 and 1/2k gold lead was gone for a little bit there but it's back and
4:23:36
it's now scarier than ever well relatively less scary you know mathematically but
4:23:45
game statewise I'm yeah GSE still not feeling too great about
4:23:50
it let's see what this dragon is going to be as we do hop on the replay rich
4:23:56
just he actually just got bom because of Aon that's so sad the only way Camille
4:24:02
gets that hook shot is cuz of the Aon while being there Ela
4:24:08
playable uh sure if you find IU and get him back in the LC yeah make iten it's
4:24:14
hextech again maybe that's the Forbidden answer to J I'm joking jce has no counters um there is no answer to so
4:24:22
it's what's actually really sad cuz I think even Champs that used to be like Mali Wukong they used to be really good
4:24:28
into him like he just now he builds tank like if he goes Cleaver fimble
4:24:33
winter Mal ultimate then what yeah like nothing really happens Wukong was another one where even with the fact
4:24:40
that he can you know and try to kind of shred through him if
4:24:46
you can't kill him or at least severely chunk him in a cyclone combo then what's the point he's just too beefy
4:24:54
yeah he gets to do whatever he wants and oh the arrow okay that's a nice quick
4:25:00
cleanse out of Viper and maybe going to open this one up but Ash arrow is down zeka being
4:25:06
pushed away that Al was a little bit confusing andil going in they're trying to burst down zeka will they be able to
4:25:13
kill Jace is the answer and goes in Rich has the angle that's a couple of kills
4:25:18
for DRX already J's trying to Front Line will be able to take one down there's the poy ultimate as well but J does have
4:25:25
to flash away they're not willing to take the rest of the fight but DRX man their resilience is so cool to see they
4:25:32
will not go down without a fight they even got the Heralds sponge stole it not done got the
4:25:39
eye man as as this game continues I think we have to face the reality that
4:25:45
DRX might just be good I don't know if I can accept it
4:25:51
chronicler is Peanut unfortunately completely whiffing and Andale sets up this whole play like actually him
4:25:57
flashing in getting the CC down onto zeka and then DRX being way quicker on
4:26:04
this play ends up being a big difference maker by the time teddy gets knocked away the fight is already lost SE most
4:26:10
likely would have been caught by that spear that could have been the end of him and the Camille getting a kill was
4:26:16
nice fact that Viper only loses Clans not more was okay but that's going to be
4:26:21
at least a ton of damage here towards that midlane turret and their Siege is not bad Valas we'll see if they can take
4:26:27
it down will be big possible flank coming in though with Jace and Camille
4:26:32
on their way and it looks like thex don't want to run the risk yeah I mean they did a huge amount of damage to that mid turret it is incredibly low so if
4:26:41
you get to an even game state they're not quite there just yet obviously a big fight that they just took to keep it
4:26:47
within touching distance and actually make this possible um especially with the ambessa
4:26:53
actually it's fine okay yeah he he he just came back it's fine we'll forgive
4:26:59
you for that one Teddy that was pretty off didn't have a lot of vision I hope he didn't hon out there
4:27:05
the L the lost one was good you know he got the Clans from Viper that actually ended up being big in the fight cuz then
4:27:10
Viper can't step up as much yeah I'm just happy he's back I think we all are
4:27:16
it was it was nice to have lazy Feld have him you know he could well show his stuff as sponge got that one double
4:27:22
solar flare coming on in and now a chance Sani just to try to peel as zeka
4:27:28
never really finds an angle in looks like that was going the way of H he Sports actually but they elect to just
4:27:34
get out of there I think it was onil that actually went for the disengage cone there probably also saw the riding on the wall I think it free stacks on
4:27:40
permafrost so if he goes down comp kind of falls apart even with Rich actually
4:27:46
doing really well in the previous fight Z is still up 40 CS um Rich obviously you know coming
4:27:54
from a game where farming is not a yeah I I can't keep making these jokes
4:28:00
he's not been in was in store for what like seven years do our viewers know what that game is I don't know some of
4:28:07
them do some of them will some of them are Bas real on hipsters uh but uh unfortunately does mean that the Camille
4:28:13
is going to keep getting further ahead and the main thing with the cam is the levels right because particularly when
4:28:19
you get ster as well her scaling on base stats gets absolutely insane on the que
4:28:25
and that is kind of what we're getting towards so even if the gold lead I think it's kind of stabilized I think it was around 6500 before as well and say keeps
4:28:33
getting these kills in fights Rich did do a good job in the previous one in terms of damage but has been giving his
4:28:38
life for his team a lot he's going to become a big and bigger issue I'm sorry
4:28:44
I really wanted to say no life is on don't do that especially not after
4:28:50
the game I couldn't do it seriously like there was just no way want to highlight Z actually going for a damage build I
4:28:56
can't believe he's doing this in 2025 why building damage J well would he do that cuz he's a he's a mid laner you
4:29:03
know you do kind of need your mid laner to do damage although you have I guess
4:29:08
you have Camille yeah which camil's a lot of true damage I I think they might be afraid otherwise they only have
4:29:13
lethality and their full ad so if you don't have an extra source of damage you might actually be lacking which I think
4:29:20
is valid they're just slowly doing the a
4:29:26
mission by the way yeah I think they're trying to get uh preferably teleport out as a sponge uh sponge there's the alt
4:29:33
coming in and the engage from Delight was super clean down goes the DRX jungler uhoh and maybe the hopes of DRX
4:29:40
in this game Z though the damage Jace is actually being burned down they take him out but there's no more onil and you're
4:29:47
not getting away from Camille So Teddy just elects to CS instead definitely the smart call as uh now they'll just be
4:29:55
gifted the aacon thank you for the leash he sponged too close to the Sun and
4:30:00
burned up ends up going down unfortunately with the flash up as well
4:30:07
sponge up to this point has been having a great game but that is what I'm not
4:30:12
going to say it after being wrong multiple times but that does feel like a kind of a game breaker here as it's the
4:30:18
Poke that actually ends up being a big difference maker Viper arrow and then
4:30:23
getting caught off guard by that flash from the puppy Reno this time of an old
4:30:29
that did hit the mark and then nicely done here by ukel and Teddy to take down but yeah zos
4:30:37
coming in from the other end of the map very easily cleans up EXT the play and
4:30:43
unfortunately that is the auton buff now here Rich uh-oh is most likely in a
4:30:51
rough spot here he is ambessa but it's ambessa and a poppy and Sani and Zea
4:30:56
comes in he says thank you very much I need to improve my KDA it's pretty bad right now so I'm just going to take this
4:31:06
kill and uh they still have the Aon buff for a minute and a half they're not going to do anything crazy with it
4:31:12
the chains will miss Viper just says whatever and we'll look
4:31:18
to push bot with his team does really feel like DRX are trying to stop this push very much was top at least he got a
4:31:25
turret it says you said vales um Aon is just the new Baron buff where we just
4:31:31
let them have you know whatever whatever they want yeah oh it's funny too because
4:31:39
as the losing team you can't overextend either because then they just respawn
4:31:44
yes you get extra gold but this dive very nice from the side of Z will they get Teddy the answer is no and actually
4:31:51
Delight will have to revive zos as well does get pushed back a bit so they get
4:31:56
100 extra gold compared to last week oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I I don't think that alone is
4:32:03
enough but it's something didn't lose any inbs it really just does feel like
4:32:08
DRX as the team against sakon they're like well we we can't do anything cuz they'll revive and then H life Esports
4:32:14
are less inclined to die so we just get we just get saate on both sides now
4:32:19
instead of actual crazy op insane Dives I think that's the first time I've seen Rift maker on
4:32:28
naly I think there's a good reason for that but Rift maker is uh it's a thing
4:32:33
nowadays UK is dead but maybe Z as well 4 seconds on Aon will they wait oh the
4:32:39
timing it's good yeah there you go they wait they get the kill and they're at least able to make
4:32:46
it they have yeah they have to keep going a one for one I don't think they can really extend the play asive just
4:32:51
says no thank you got the red buff for Viper and peanut and
4:32:57
dipped rich rich okay there you go nice angle Delight not able to do anything to
4:33:02
save PE up but the Flash and the dash there is an ALT straight into edge of
4:33:07
Knight that could have actually been like if they get that they get mid lane push and it may be set up for
4:33:14
Baron could have been a moment but Viper Says peut you have caught so many skill
4:33:19
shots for me I got you back and you worry first time it's first time for
4:33:26
everything as we take another look UK yeah there's no
4:33:31
turret ends up getting completely bodied by zeka but the play as a whole is
4:33:37
probably still worth it because the timing here means that zacha just hasn't going down unfortunately even with the
4:33:42
kill speak donated to him KDA crying yet again and then we had rich with a nice
4:33:47
catch on Peanut peut does Flash which actually is a big cool down now the only
4:33:54
way that I see H life losing this game is throw at Baron so as long as they don't do that they should be it's the
4:34:00
only thing yeah they should be I I think if you just set up this which is Z's two levels up and in a 1 V one I like sponge
4:34:08
hovering around just in case because Z knows that he always wins the 1 V one and did he know it was a 1 V2 in that
4:34:15
little moment in time I mean he might even win the 1 V2 Val that like he has ster prob does yeah level
4:34:23
15 upgraded plated steel caps I am happy to see Za onic carry is zeka oh no Z
4:34:31
he's being bullied so much in this game TP yeah the TP I don't know about this
4:34:37
one he is going to get back over the wall but ooh okay
4:34:43
DRX making plays it does still feel like
4:34:48
the issues that we've had with h life are are kind of there right like just these catches continuously happening
4:34:54
these fights looking asive okay well DRX this is a hill Mar I've ever seen one but why
4:35:00
not you might as well the game is in that position at the moment Andel is
4:35:06
level 9 against level 15 Zeus and down go sponge sponge is dead and so is Rich
4:35:12
and so is an okay well that was a short Liv Hill Mary I like that they went for it the thing about Hill Mar is that you
4:35:20
generally they don't they don't work out vas and unfortunately they don't even
4:35:25
need zaka uh zaka is not necessary for this game plan to work out life will be
4:35:31
bringing us to a one and Z okay but I bullied the whole game building actual
4:35:38
damage J this is why we don't go for these builds you just build tank
4:35:43
instead he was trying to be not cringe but honestly sometimes you just got to send
4:35:49
it and be cringe it's fine um yeah so that's another kill as well onto Andel but at least that is
4:35:56
going to push them back from ending the game to the Chagrin of the Korean commentators who all grown at the same
4:36:04
time they really going to step up our game the teddy this is a hard game to play out you're playing into poppy
4:36:10
playing into cil's his arrows outside of that one have actually been on point and then unfortunately here they can't extend the
4:36:17
play big old there from theight because if they somehow got to lock down Z there as well and take him down could have
4:36:23
been big as uh on this like I found Z watch what happens to his health bar as
4:36:28
the Q2 comes in yeah uh and then sponge just gets
4:36:34
slammed into a wall uh unfortunately dies unceremoniously without the nly no damage available
4:36:41
and on my life playing it out as
4:36:47
uh I I I I I purposely made that happen
4:36:52
um that's that's he's just like me for real like just yeah I died but I I guys
4:36:58
I wasted the cool Downs that made that happen that was all me I set up that fight uh you can thank me later so H
4:37:08
Sports going to get the baron we did see a go Ping On The Tex te Drake for DRX
4:37:13
who say well we can't contest the baron let's take the dragon we might as
4:37:21
well and they will be able to get it there not much that H Sports can do to stop this unless they ran directly over
4:37:28
and tried to stop some backs but that's not going to happen they're just going to try to push an end I wouldn't be shocked if Z is 1 v5s at this point um
4:37:35
but uh he doesn't have a TP so can't go towards the bot side of the map so the last still M didn't quite
4:37:42
work out another one is going to have to come through 11k gold deficit next you know UK's been very good about turning
4:37:49
fights and making big plays uh yep and know the cor key maybe he can do it vas
4:37:55
let's see the valkyrie angle uh maybe no I don't think so the
4:38:01
popy AL let's see where this one lands uh it's not going to land it doesn't quite matter is z just going to Maul the
4:38:08
ash to death as the rest of the team does die as well this is the Nexus going down how Esports will very much take
4:38:16
down DRX in unceremonious fashion and uh the Camille looking very
4:38:22
strong in this match up against ambessa on the carry looking quite solid
4:38:31
there impeccable Camille game lot of backline pressure and this one was also mostly
4:38:37
standard Lanes we started out with Lane swap a little bit of funny action but then pretty quickly we
4:38:43
just went into the straight up 1 V one 2v2 Lanes Zea I think his triggers do
4:38:49
somewhat continue but outside of that I think great game Delight Viper no notes
4:38:55
we have uh Z coming in hot and unfortunately for DRX still I want to
4:39:00
give credit to their early fights I think that these guys are looking at a
4:39:06
at a performance that is much higher than what I was expecting even as we see more and more of it I actually like the
4:39:11
productivity the fights that they go for did really feel like they were kind of outgun there a couple of crucial
4:39:17
mistakes in where they were on the map means they were always fighting from the back foot they absolutely were halalay
4:39:24
ESP Sports proving they are a very strong team here from group Baron and
4:39:29
guys we'll take a break and have the space to break down that game we'll be right back
4:39:39
[Music]
4:39:47

4:40:41
[Music]
4:40:58
[Music]
4:41:05
come on come on come on
4:41:39
that edge of KN is so important to deal with is now h on a flank angle they haven't dealt with the wave just
4:41:46
yet this there are flanks upon flanks is crashing as well did they go
4:41:52
yeah Morgan's making his way around the ulti comes down from closer H misses the que though as CZ goes in closer is the
4:41:58
one in trouble but he lands the combo and it does so much damage C has to flash for it has now doed on on top of
4:42:05
hype Dr maybe the hero for KT has Morgan in the river by himself now h
4:42:12
po picked up by
4:42:18
bity what can they find can they get on top of does not have
4:42:24
aash angle here on a dooo but sponge is kind of going for a walk on the left side he's so tanky though UK again he's
4:42:31
going to fight in the front line massive Oriana ultimate but it there's no followup he crackes a lot but the DPS
4:42:38
isn't there DRX are too far ahead and newal has put on a show once
4:42:49
again he's got hiss in the wrong position yeah I'm like everybody except we is having a pretty good time we is
4:42:55
sacrificing himself right so that's why uh I mean all of KT can never perform at
4:43:00
the same time that would not be KT at all yeah pry G
4:43:07
okay that oh even gets the does he die yeah uh because yeah smash just chases
4:43:13
him down has the extra movement speed from the Inspire and it is so D like
4:43:18
this is this should be just baren the EV flow of this fight though
4:43:25
you can see now Morgan moving in spots the teleport might see that this is the time magnastorm this time finally
4:43:31
working up the polymorph is gorgeous H Morgan into the back line he's stunned forever but he still has access to that
4:43:37
Counter Strike and he's still going to be feared beond
4:43:49
there four people with the ultimate and now hyp can you do it can you be the
4:43:54
Savior can you be the The Flash is so [Music]
4:44:01
good now they're pushing into the river Still Standing what doesn't P makes stronger Ben on the dragon oan so points
4:44:10
I said they wouldn't fight over they're all going all in GOI knocking up everybody but he's super low and Kake in
4:44:16
the backline is totally fine but dud just got here and now it's a 5v5 but everybody on the the kick is massive
4:44:23
from Canyon but it might not matter D in the back line not able to quite do enough
4:44:30
damage but pan as well still alive full health but he doesn't have a front line anymore the knockup comes in and pan so
4:44:38
sad for him he gets knocked down
4:45:05
back
4:45:13

[Music]
4:46:33
it's a happy zus day for all those who celebrate as it is 10 the Top Lane
4:46:38
birthday boy get the job done over yesterday's birthday boy youal and DRX
4:46:44
and you would know that all if you follow the social media account over at lck official make sure you go and do
4:46:49
that Deon here alongside with did and wolf for that last game and early start
4:46:56
okay and then things snowballed a little bit out of control we were waiting for peanut to land a couple of sichani old
4:47:02
throughout the series there was a lot that happened in that one yeah some oopsies on S ulti but you have to remember that they had really uh clean
4:47:09
dive on the both side I think that snowall the game earlier so after that I think those oopsies can happen all the
4:47:15
time yeah I mean it wasn't the cleanest game um by any stretches of the imagination but Zas on Camille ends up
4:47:22
getting big right and makes it so difficult for Dix to play this out we want to talk about the corki wi especially in the mid lane I mean AD
4:47:29
carry corki brought up some some W's in the bank but not on mid lane and
4:47:34
especially not with the AP junglers right I I mean I really like corki mid it still has a strong o game but but I
4:47:41
feel like it only pairs good with Iver but no one is playing Iver on lck so
4:47:47
it's also just not a strong Sid Lane champion in most matchups so you're really hinging everything on that two
4:47:53
item Spike you're nerfing your early game you're nerfing n cuz you have no setup for her so it just didn't really
4:47:58
feel like it fit this draft specifically the win rate is atrocious right but like this draft wasn't it for corki yeah it
4:48:05
felt like a very specific type of fight that you're looking for if you're DRX
4:48:10
with the SE see that you had otherwise you fall behind and and things go wrong and here's the moment where they do so
4:48:16
we talked a lot about Tower Dives earlier well what if you dive behind the tower here with did yeah I mean the
4:48:21
details were really clean Sani was just waiting for the team to be in range and also like after that just Viper no
4:48:29
hesitation here just flashing on Leona it's it doesn't matter what Target they uh crush on them you just need to clear
4:48:36
one Target and after that they didn't went back to the turret that means that it's not a turret dive actually you know
4:48:42
they're just killing people and also that detail on the corki as well he just
4:48:47
Q flash on uh corki with the sejuani that made a lot easier on the dive as
4:48:53
well unfortunately UK's returned or not returned but like his late arrival to the bottom Lane there means that it's
4:49:00
really easy to then just collapse on him as well if he instead decides as soon as they end up losing that first member I'm
4:49:06
just going to try to push for a mid plate he can at least get some value out of his you know in his own lane out of
4:49:11
that faster roam coming through from the Jace but instead because he comes down he just ends up being free food which
4:49:16
doesn't help his mid game cycle we were talking about the two item Spike so then DRX fall behind we're thinking they'd
4:49:21
fall apart they don't stabilized a little bit which then led to our next fight here at Aon I mean you never do
4:49:28
the objectives when enemy team has poke like zigs and virus like it was really
4:49:34
hard at first place and anyways look at the damage from the V it was easy angle for the Delight to engage on this and
4:49:41
yeah after that it kind of fells off it's just really desperation here I think out of DRX the setup they were
4:49:47
looking for wasn't there and you know Teddy had a pretty good game on the ash his positioning was good he had a few good punishes with Rich you know we're
4:49:52
not showing all of those here but this unfortunately this wasn't really one of those fights where everyone's on the same page and the only thing they can
4:49:58
try to do is take out Zea because he's up there but it's at the cost of two more members when that res buff is
4:50:04
already up I mean obviously the game was really hard for DRX but I feel like the teams are more uh kind of just running
4:50:11
it down after the O game Falls uh I don't think game is that hard to like
4:50:16
bounce back you know I think you can give up the atakan like if you need it cuz it's it's GA anyways right like
4:50:23
after like 3 minutes of farm you have you still have chance to bounce back but I feel like just teams are giving up way
4:50:29
too fast we usually skip past draft or we've skipped past draft a little bit
4:50:34
more but uh interesting little wrinkle we got to see Camille into the ambessa uh a new entrance there in the top the
4:50:41
Top Lane kind of combat here in game one what did you make of that I I think that
4:50:46
also comes from the uh swap kind of strategy cuz they picked Jace earlier right normally you think it's j on the
4:50:53
top Lane but you have zeka who plays a lot of AD Champions on the mid lane so I think that kind of a mind game uh from
4:51:01
hle was kind of on point I don't always like Camille and the ash because she's you know one of those Champions that has
4:51:06
to go really deep and if she doesn't end up securing that kill with her team then she can just kind of get kited and
4:51:11
eventually killed but when you have that Jace to follow up on that engage from long range that actually has a lot of synergy there especially with the Sani
4:51:18
with it as well and then last point back to you wolf cuz we talked about it uh during the break this was the first game
4:51:24
back here for Teddy after coming back feeling sick how did you feel like his debut went despite the fact that DRX had
4:51:31
their plan get derailed early I think it's it's really tough to compare Teddy to Lazy field in this isolated game but
4:51:37
I do think Teddy looked like he was on form despite obviously being hospitalized and not being able to scrim and practice with the team directly um
4:51:44
so it's a good look I think for Teddy so far maybe we'll see him on a bit more of a playmaking champion here going to the
4:51:50
rest of the series yeah he's known as uh one of the vocal player on his role so I think that's a huge difference between
4:51:56
LA Phi and Teddy uh so I really want to see some like clean rotation from DRX uh
4:52:03
actually just playing around teddy as well yeah the makeup of this team changes when you have someone that vocal
4:52:09
uh out they come back in and remember their only other loss was to T1 this is the other big test that they have let's
4:52:14
see if they're able to bounce back here in game number two as we send it back on over to the casters thank you spacers for the
4:52:21
breakdown as happy birthday Z and happy Z St win that says and a lot of Z fans
4:52:31
obviously uh for this player and it was nice to see among Camille you know uh carry in the Top Lane wins the matchup
4:52:38
has Sani has counter pick with the swap it was just the perfect position and
4:52:44
that's really where you're going to find a lot of value with players that have deep Champion pools and can play carries
4:52:50
and that's what we know zos for DRX will stay on the blue side
4:52:56
unsurprisingly we'll see if the draft favors them a bit more this time around
4:53:01
because Z will get counterpick again potentially if I'm H not going to be
4:53:06
feeling too bad about that opportunity only in game two so there is
4:53:11
still a ton of Champions open yon scarner I imagine will just keep hitting the ban list maybe air as
4:53:18
well outside of that kalista is still
4:53:23
available n taken away maybe looking for an early pickup
4:53:30
of something like the Renekton or the ja if for Rich of Sani already gone which is actually another one of
4:53:37
spong's comfort Champions ghosted at very very often are going to be seen here Rumble as well
4:53:46
Cante is it just yeah B1 cassant yeah or unless they ban it R3 ban
4:53:53
Cante there you go and be VI is open this time around I
4:54:01
do think Vai is one of those Champions where if you're team or if you're opponent really wants to it's not that
4:54:06
hard to drop a composition into it that just kind obliterates it but generally
4:54:12
teams just don't uh we've seen DK do it with the zillian you know playing F into zillian is uh just the worst I I do feel
4:54:21
like though a lot of players can't play zillian well a lot and a lot of teams can't play around it well because they
4:54:26
just don't have practice on it they just want to play what they know and something that zeka knows is the Gallo
4:54:35
he going to be playing it here or at least I I hope he knows enough of about
4:54:40
it and thinking about sh as well that's a lot of circles got a knockup circle
4:54:47
got a knock away Circle just layer these on top you know
4:54:53
what champ has a damage Circle zigs he does yeah he does have a
4:55:01
damage Circle and you just pick another Top Lane 80 character for SE yeah okay
4:55:06
so maybe something with CC something that can really bully Lane how about
4:55:13
TF ad TF top perfect it's bring it back yeah uh sorry for Al fans that have
4:55:21
flashbacks the last year as Diora gets locked in kind of sad we haven't seen that
4:55:27
Aurora nocton combo I really like it thought was very fun not going to see it here today either really feels like
4:55:33
Aurora has fallen off in a big way she has yeah she's really relegated to like second rotation bands as CAD priority
4:55:40
here for Teddy woo well forces out in media response and then also most likely
4:55:46
forces out in El ban as well yeah although I don't know how you feel about the Elise band when they play
4:55:52
asreal and it's like realistically how often are you going to be hitting Viper yeah I I just
4:55:58
don't really think the Caitlyn this early on is a good idea because if they
4:56:04
want to they can ban a lot of things that go well with Caitlyn they had third pick to to answer the Caitlyn with the e
4:56:10
like there's a lot of great stuff still available um so you know what's with the priority hey
4:56:18
kayin hasn't seen too much success either the jack is going to be banned here yeah I was wondering cuz it could
4:56:24
also be Aurora top we don't actually know where the Aurora is going yet but you can do the same thing and then pick
4:56:30
support pick something like the I'm double checking like the ra for example
4:56:35
uh while still having the opportunity to go in aggressively raan is another Poppy already taken off the board Leona's
4:56:42
already gone so I feel like the raan stocks are quite high and you still don't give anything away without really
4:56:48
risking too much cuz Caitlin definitely need a team that can play around it for
4:56:55
it to really have the value that you be looking for Roman no surprise but now H life can
4:57:02
just slam raan here on four Poppy's gone
4:57:08
Leona's gone Karma gone Ando going to play like
4:57:14
maai what uh what are we doing here the Gallo is also still technically a flex I think we've only seen the Gallo tank
4:57:20
into what Rumble which OB he's taken off the board yeah but if it ends up being
4:57:25
Aurora top Z is happy to Pilot it there is still some Flex potential here can put
4:57:32
zaka on really any of his melee Champions and yeah I do think the Ronan is a good call both because the light is
4:57:38
amazing at it two of its counters are already gone and then they are just going to pick the Elise I don't love
4:57:46
that yeah I mean you can and you've got repel to get away from you know Nautilus
4:57:53
or just because we can not we need we must F this they both start with the
4:57:59
letter e oh no no no no no no no no no yes yeah Caitlyn Tom kench do not do
4:58:06
Caitlyn Tom kench please uh n Nico makes sense has the ability to use the Clone to
4:58:15
tank you know tank a cocoon yeah you have a good amount of frat yourself you combo well of the Caitlin I think this
4:58:21
is great completely fine could still be UK kind of technically as we are going
4:58:27
to Blind gragas you know with Nar band they can pick silus
4:58:33
here yeah you have a lot of AP but you
4:58:38
have Gra ni alt yeah it's I I mean it's okay I don't
4:58:44
think it's that it it's not bad but it could
4:58:50
be worse certainly doesn't look like they're going to do that unless he's playing a top
4:58:57
but as a delight is pranking everyone we're not going to get excited until anything is locked in
4:59:06
oh wait what ani [Music]
4:59:14
yeah what does it mean is it sea Ania cuz you could tell
4:59:20
me it's Z and I would believe you just as much as sea is this the hidden aora not
4:59:27
t because playing a Niva into gragas is a terrible idea well I I I hate it but I
4:59:33
don't know if a Nivea is getting locked I'm uh okay no it is
4:59:41
it is aniva into gragas
4:59:46
well I hope you never get ganked cuz I don't see how you live through that but I'm going to I'm going to say in the One
4:59:52
V one that does not sound like a like how do you MCH to shove post six I guess you don't you
4:59:59
just okay I feel like this is you just cast I feel like this is and he's a sitting bird I this is my fault I joked
5:00:07
about the adtf top why why do you always do this chronicler I don't know I don't
5:00:13
mean to a Caster curse Caster blessing I mean at least we get to see an Nivia top that's
5:00:20
cool I don't think it's a good idea he is on his the shy AR okay we're just
5:00:27
going to let him be we're just going to accept see what happens this is like no judgment until one was too easy so now
5:00:35
let's give ourselves a real challenge with top anivia as we hop on the rift
5:00:41
for game number
5:00:56
[Music] two
5:01:05
so you you can see the lines right chronicler you're good at seeing the lines lines H just maybe as good as you
5:01:12
are at Caster cursing maybe not quite that good cter curses aren't real V okay
5:01:18
oh God it's it's grasp as well so so maybe if J can build tank yeah so maybe
5:01:25
it's the well I I don't actually know what the build's going to be like because there are a couple of different Avenues you can take right you can just
5:01:31
go grasp and Go full damage you can go grasp and you can do what greas did earlier which is like Cosmic dry fimble
5:01:37
winter cuz I do assume you still have to go Mana items cuz you're playing anivia I I haven't seen the runes yet but I
5:01:43
assume the Precision is uh going to be presence of mind but the Nia is one of
5:01:50
those picks where if you do get to level six you can also you can be in any leaning situation and you can just wave
5:01:56
clear indefinitely yeah cross a niia say also I'm pretty
5:02:02
sure got a ward early on so does actually have a good amount of
5:02:07
experience immediately as yeah presence of mine and cut down
5:02:13
demolish that's the ax zigs build right there those runes so does Z win this
5:02:21
well he missed his yeah cuz he got boded slammed so he couldn't activate the second part of the vi still winning I
5:02:29
mean he is ranged right so he is going to be very annoying in the early parts of this Lane that that doesn't change he
5:02:34
also hit level two like free grass procs already yeah he's got another one
5:02:40
prepped ready to go let's see if you're rich you're like
5:02:46
what what what the hell is this bird doing in my Lane like not not just I've
5:02:51
never seen this bird cuz who plays a Nia yeah like there was exactly one player that's known for playing Ania that's
5:02:58
froggin FR and I'm sure a lot of fans hear the name and go who are you talking about Frog
5:03:05
who uh there's something happening in mid here UK Cal trying to get a kill but unfortunately for him there's a million
5:03:10
people here he is going to get first Blood though and trades flashes with zeka so worth for
5:03:19
him although I mean there is assist gold that does come through
5:03:24
but yeah interesting little trade there we didn't get to see the beginning of that but a lot of damage coming out from
5:03:31
Aurora yeah SAA you knew the match up you were going in um I'm not so sure about the getting
5:03:38
solo bolo even with Pina paying attention to your lane early on and also Z being in your lane level one like I
5:03:45
don't know what happened there as unfortunately rich is having a very unfun and uninteractive gameplay
5:03:52
experience and has the base yeah oh my God once s gets level six
5:03:59
this is going to be this going to be painful Valas as we
5:04:04
might have a fight on our hands here as oh oh the flash Delight flashes
5:04:10
over the vi and and then give him a fist bump wow yeah so he flashes over the vi
5:04:18
and then sponge flashes the the Cocoon so no one dies as very straightforward
5:04:24
he did yeah second just multiple passive
5:04:30
hits gets his Justice punch canceled in the wind up just
5:04:37
everything yeah so peut got a kill out of that which is good but UK also has
5:04:42
been able to build the a lead which he's going to be feeling good about so the one big weakness that I do imagine for
5:04:49
the civia is what if you get Dove um hasn't backed yet also still has
5:04:56
passive now if you are a viewer that does not what this Champion does because it it hasn't been seen uh in Pro play
5:05:02
for a very long time yeah where where's our where's our you know it's been 365
5:05:08
days since it oh it's LK cup so it's the first time it's played yeah no we don't uh but it's the
5:05:15
first time it's played an LK cup I can tell you that was certainly and so anivia want to see the graphic we got
5:05:22
the big stun we get the damage the little icicle uh we have the little
5:05:28
icicle well it's a little icicle that does big damage okay the icicle dares to dream now we got the wall most iconic
5:05:35
I'd say and then no where you just throw a giant it's a circle STM remember when we were
5:05:42
thinking about Circle oh my God it's the extra Circle it's the third circle time
5:05:48
compl the diagram and our Scouts have actually reported that se has been playing a lot
5:05:54
of top anivia and solo que it does makes it is one of those things where you think about it for a little bit and imagine just being your average top
5:06:00
laner and playing into anivia with grasp it's like gross karma is nothing compared to this oh actually I don't
5:06:06
know if that's true gross karma is objectively evil um yeah that that shouldn't be
5:06:12
allowed actually uh in the game that should be disabled
5:06:17
um so they're going to take the cloud Drake here DRX and trying to set up for this Z has
5:06:24
hit level six and he has a tier he's building towards what could be a rod oh
5:06:30
theight he's on a flang he's level three it's fine he has cocon he has full build
5:06:35
he's a leise he's a leise level three it's all you need when becomes nothing there's the
5:06:41
Cocoon with no followup and that was onto andil D step ignite nice repel Z's got
5:06:48
an angle here he doesn't have Flash though hard for him to just get across and Z is zoning out he's
5:06:55
Z zoning them with the anival little fight for the last grub
5:07:01
let's see it who's going to get it uh it's just going to come down to a Smite from that one but R is just standing he
5:07:07
doesn't know what anivia does stand hands in the old the Wall comes down and anivia gets a kill as well and that's
5:07:15
two for Amal life Esports and the one grub to deny from
5:07:21
DRX rich as we speak fervently looking up YouTube videos what does the Nivea
5:07:28
do is the attempt at flank from the light doesn't really hit the mark but doesn't matter as much rest of the team
5:07:34
is ready Zea actually on a good flank angle there as this is off after the
5:07:40
fact Zas has bone plaing rich just gets cced ends up going down and he doesn't
5:07:47
really get to go anywhere either I think a lot of this came comes down to what happened before this just the position
5:07:53
being taken by Han life and if they can CC anyone for a little bit of time in Z's
5:07:58
ultimate that's going to be tough now Catalyst done tier started to
5:08:04
stack so I guess he is just going like standard a we don't know it might be fimble winter instead but
5:08:10
into AR angels and maybe after that you go tank we'll see I just the tank builds
5:08:17
have scar this I mean you know it could just be like a zir teddy just have grasp
5:08:22
uh Teddy yeah he's he's dead and that is going to be handed over to
5:08:28
Viper no that's mean man you can't just insect people on zenzo why not what that looks cool it
5:08:36
did it's very nean yeah I want to see more of that any any especially if you haven't played
5:08:43
that much zzo yet any zzo player has tried to do that after they've already challenged someone and then realized
5:08:48
very quickly that that doesn't work so uh the key thing here is that if if he would have eat then Teddy would have had
5:08:56
a like buff on him so you can't knck him back yeah just don't do that don't do
5:09:01
that but Pina doesn't do that cuz he knows what the champion does so very nicely just flash gets the knock back
5:09:07
Teddy I think realistic is like yeah okay I'm definitely dead here doesn't invest the Summoners which was the right
5:09:13
call and things are not not so good Bel as um we are not quite at the 2 and 1/2k
5:09:20
gold deficit of at 10 minutes but you know we can still have another minute so I'll have to see
5:09:26
Sponge we still we still have top Ana in this game so I'm
5:09:32
excited yeah I I'm not complaining you know this is one of those things where I feel like Tim didn't have to do this in
5:09:37
F oh my God Delight sponge no sponge is dead oh no
5:09:44
well I mean he had a cool play but he had to use his Flash Forward no not the bird the bird's here Teddy has flash but
5:09:53
uh okay he's going to just n over the wall that's totally fine not forced into the
5:10:00
egg the bird is the word yeah as good as that sponge play was initially like really nicely set up
5:10:07
goes for the flash Q to ensure that the light doesn't get to repel up and just toate the damage also ends up killing
5:10:13
him new turrets are very scary the light out and about on the map again spot you
5:10:20
nothing going to come of it for
5:10:26
now I wonder if this Caitlin pick was a bit of comfort as well as to light the flash cocoon into Andel he's going to
5:10:33
throw in a pop Blossom just to die didn't really have any other option so can't really blame him the second gets
5:10:39
cakon he's dead does get the flash out of Viper so that's something Viper did Flash to ensure that he wasn't Knocked
5:10:46
Up by the pop blossome still not going to be feeling great about that one and maybe it's like both we saw andil kind
5:10:52
of hesitate and being like I don't know if I want to play Nico maybe it's both well andil doesn't feel as comfortable
5:10:58
on Nico and then Teddy really wanted to play Caitlyn as we take another look here nice by Sponge charges up in the
5:11:06
bush um Delight feel cuz he's a Le but because he flashes he also doesn't have
5:11:12
the opportunity and here you see onal tries to do the right thing which is ensure that they can't actually hit you
5:11:19
by using your clone as o DRX o no all right they're trying to get in The Cask
5:11:25
used on the Ezreal and Viper will be forced away for now Zea doing a good job zoning on the
5:11:31
left side but Rich taking a huge amount of damage and if you don't have cast for the anivia you just get to Zone everyone
5:11:38
as Pina going to take take out sponge and the entire right side of the fight is already lost by DX yes passive cannot
5:11:45
kill him he can kill him you don't have a way to stop his ult I was looking at the gragas and I'm like hey not a bad
5:11:51
option in aniv you can throw Cask on him if he's got his ult up we just haven't seen that be a reality at all in this
5:11:58
game even once yeah are youing yeah Z really is trying to
5:12:03
challenge himself in this game um and he's just that tanky as well with just the Catalyst and
5:12:09
this is it's it's it's not good for you if you win Worlds you know like you're going to start doing weird stuff as UK
5:12:15
trying to keep this game alive oh the the blood pedal okay well yeah he he's still dead
5:12:24
yeah um okay pper going to dodge that he's got a z and he gets
5:12:30
away a lot of low health bars there meanwhile H Sports taking the hex tech
5:12:35
Drake on the bottom side of the map so the gold lead is stable Piper does
5:12:42
have e do note also Zea there I think we should let this one go thank you observers keeping us in the dark for a
5:12:48
little bit there Viper has really cuz we've been talking about the anivia cuz it's it's fun uh and it's interesting
5:12:55
but what's actually been happening is that Viper is free and zero uh which doesn't feel great and I
5:13:00
think retaking control is so hard but yeah he gives this combo on Ezreal and he just
5:13:07
eat and Ted's the Ezreal in the anivia alt yeah it's just a
5:13:16
disaster well I yeah okay rich as well is having a bit of trouble here also
5:13:22
going to get aled by Ezreal true shop barage helping out a little alov gaming
5:13:28
and just dies instead Delight will take that the final uto in P immediately
5:13:33
basing it's like o I've seen it in Solo q that doesn't go over well generally that guy is going to be AFK
5:13:39
the rest of the game not peanut in the side lane not peanut yeah so looking for
5:13:45
the first turret plate still up here at what what where'd he go Bron this game
5:13:52
is so silly at least support is still a thing and it dies very fast to
5:13:59
Aurora there have been exactly two people that have made this pick look good and one
5:14:06
is is okay one sec we to see what happens here uh Viper's dead he doesn't
5:14:11
have his e doesn't have Flash that's a lot of gold given over to sponge and just like us H life are having a bit too
5:14:18
much fun and as a result UK's just frantically running around murdering people which is a good win condition
5:14:24
going to go out there and say it it also happens in Solo key you know like the team gets so far ahead they start
5:14:30
throwing yeah you know H life this is not solu this is in fact the lck cup
5:14:36
2025 so the only two people that have made Elite Sport looks good uh one is two
5:14:43
time world champion and uh Genius Monster carer yes and the other one is one of
5:14:50
the biggest enigmas in League Esports also two times world champion and died almost 10 times on the champion while
5:14:57
winning yes which is barel barel if barel those the two sides of the spectrum those are the two I yeah it's
5:15:05
just like K said in that one interview you know you're not K you're not on T1
5:15:10
you shouldn't play this but the other lck teams did not take heat of that warning um Sponge has
5:15:18
actually been having a clean game as well on the vi been where he needed to be uh obviously the top side play was a
5:15:24
bit too much but Viper here doesn't have his Flash and even with the buffer gets caught by UK on this there was like H I
5:15:34
don't want to steal away the kill yeah assis doesn't matter that much as we're trying you can't dive Ania the wave
5:15:40
clear is is there I don't even Zea you're not paying
5:15:46
attention you can't dive the anivia you don't need to TP to Top Lane level 11
5:15:51
for say as well also I'm pretty sure he is actually going for fibble winter
5:15:58
next yeah no that's not you can't play you can't play just go and play tank anivia F this why not cuz it's evil I
5:16:06
think it's fine it's much better than tank Karma we we already were over this yeah I
5:16:12
guess I think the problem is grasp I think the problem and tank items
5:16:18
yeah and why not both I guess it is a bit of both so and and the Top Lane
5:16:25
meta yeah Lan swap Lan swaps exist L swaps yeah there's like a lot of things
5:16:30
that come together it's a very difficult issue now that I think about it wouldn't oh oh a chance to kill tank and
5:16:39
I mean kind of tank in AIA there's The Cask can you get him in the egg yes you can he's going to die I don't I don't
5:16:46
know if they can kill him in time no they have the for sure they have the cool Downs okay he didn't have flash uh they
5:16:53
did it oh my do you know the one that the JoJo gift where it's like just people okay it's just three guys
5:16:58
punching down and one person lying down that was how that that's not a very nice gift well no but he was like in the
5:17:04
corner as an egg getting like buddy slammed and punched and Buddy slammed and punched
5:17:10
uh-oh okay got to hit your W peanut or does he no maybe he doesn't okay no not
5:17:16
not going to hit it doesn't have to either you can't tell Peanut what he can and can't do he gets to do whatever he
5:17:24
wants and he's going to drop the rift Herald in Top Lane meanwhile the mid turret is going down yeah they're also
5:17:31
dropping a heral in top yeah they have four grubs so you know do it doing some
5:17:37
work cosic drive now done here for Rich we'll see peod uh driving Harold
5:17:46
into the wall which seems mean sponge I I love that this game really does feel like H life is like ah this one's in the
5:17:52
back and DRX is like no they did that game one say might die again like the tp's behind
5:17:59
him that Q is pretty interesting spun Z's on his way there's the flash Z's on
5:18:05
his way yeah there's The Cask and now zeka coming in but you're is already dead he did Kill VI as well though so
5:18:13
that's Dragon Teddy just flashed I know this flash as well Viper's level 11 Viper's
5:18:20
not done yet he's got red buff he coming in I mean they get the knock up on him he just he just it's
5:18:27
fine away yeah why not I'm Ezreal it's fine do whatever I
5:18:33
want and UK's pushing top while the Drake fight was happening the Drake fight that wasn't
5:18:39
really a drake fight that turned into a little bit of a fight which ended up with Viper using both the subs R is
5:18:45
coming back in this game like Z is now dying back to back evading that gank
5:18:54
gracefully oh he has a flash but you know good side step
5:19:00
Al zus just like taking that blast cone that's a little optimistic you're a
5:19:06
Nivea with no passive don't I think you can do that no vision he's just like yeah whatever I should be
5:19:13
fine surely it'll be okay it really does feel like a solo Q game and how it's playing out like Viper going in there is
5:19:19
also Peak solo is like I'm level 11 as real I have my Triforce I will go
5:19:25
wherever I please and then he has to blow both THS he's like a it's fine I I don't care yeah I've got this uh this
5:19:31
great support who's going to help me out a lot in staying alive at least with storm surge yeah we have
5:19:39
Gallo Gallo is basically a sport yeah
5:19:44
absolutely Z you had like a 700 gold lead I was really I was really excited
5:19:49
after the the Camille game but this
5:19:55
one not the cleanest game really it does feel like peanut and yal are actually
5:20:03
playing as clean of a game as they can and then the rest rest of the players just kind of Yaky sexing all over the ri
5:20:11
yeah as Aon comes up we'll see if Ida team is willing to
5:20:19
go for this anytime soon I think DRX probably the coach took them into the booth after that game one and they like
5:20:25
guys you're playing against Jace and what else are they playing against uh
5:20:31
varis yeah you can't just start the oton in front of them when you're down 3,000
5:20:37
Gold Guys how AV Sports they have a bit of a different situation though they are
5:20:43
actually 3,000 gold ahead and they're still they're still respecting yeah you really have to uh there is a lot of AOE
5:20:50
team fighting potential on thex oh good blue Ward there end up seeing a lot as a
5:20:56
wolf or scouting reporter has actually tell told us that zos in fact does
5:21:01
always go f winter and as we see that does now have that finish not quite hit
5:21:07
the threshold yet yet we will be doing so soon you know you got a lot of CC get
5:21:13
a good amount of value out of that and always love the Mana if you're an niia when is Rise coming back that's
5:21:19
what I want to know all these tank items do we need rise back Ryan just doesn't have the range
5:21:26
I'm pretty sure no well he's just too are you trying to will it into existence
5:21:31
yeah sure too old pretty sure do rise as well while keen's played it a few times
5:21:39
when did anivia come out I'm pretty sure it's season 1 it wasn't on release though right I
5:21:46
don't know it was the release I started uh playing in season two I know that rise was so you know it doesn't really
5:21:53
get older than like rise Annie aliser etc etc
5:22:00
um but aniv I do wonder I don't actually know that one used to play a lot of anivia in a in
5:22:08
a different meta a different now no but now that Z is playing it and
5:22:14
maybe H life Esports win this game oh you should ban it tonight solo Q I'm just warning you yeah just don't even
5:22:20
take the chance right just don't even let it happen imagine being a top laner in Solo qu with your jungler who is only
5:22:26
paing bot while being stuck in a one V
5:22:32
one so n's release according according to to gson n was
5:22:41
released on 2009 July 10th
5:22:47
so that that is like season one right wow and here she is in all
5:22:54
glory Ice Bird same
5:23:02
champ rise was uh February 21st so thank you for the update
5:23:10
yeah sise is pretty old H I don't think we should see him well he's both you know in game
5:23:16
and yeah also he's been changed like 8,000 million times so 100% the most
5:23:22
reworks of any Champion yeah peanut on the chase Viper trying to recreate the
5:23:30
smash highlight that we did see but not meant to be sponge just taking a bit of poke see
5:23:38
the Pink's going down rich on his merry way this is not done if H life go too
5:23:44
crazy at Aon they're shredded and they get caught in a couple of big team fight outs could be a problem what
5:23:49
they well they're they're not cuz they're not doing it they're just doing the infernal Soul point so maybe we
5:23:56
trade uh we're going to try and get a kill on zeeka yeah I mean that's already a lot of damage here on uh Teddy he's
5:24:01
going to try to all out and he will be successful just like that they are going to start AAC condo rich
5:24:08
he is standing guard uh this is unvision they do not have the damage to do this
5:24:14
it's just two people and they're going to oh oh and on a flank flanking who flanking the
5:24:23
light he's still flanking does he I was about to say like he's going to
5:24:31
e Viper here H's got to be careful he's getting
5:24:37
taunted uh yeah well he's okay he's just dead meanwhile DRX they did not learn
5:24:43
their lesson from game one they're trying to Twan the Aon while their
5:24:49
support I don't I don't believe it I don't believe it uh well the light's almost down they they can still play
5:24:56
this fight this is a four versus four Valdez I'm not a Believer how do you get
5:25:01
through this look at the walls what is this how do you play against that DX
5:25:06
like wait what the hell that how is this allowed season one baby oh sponge sponge needs access but
5:25:14
Zea is just standing guard and it's just going to come down to the Smite and there you go you can't get past the
5:25:20
anivia and the one little aacon wall that's all it took and zeka's Dead uh well he's going
5:25:27
to revive okay extra gold given over they're trying to do it a lot of damage comes out for Viper but it doesn't
5:25:32
matter big turnaround here from DRX they're just getting so much gold and
5:25:38
and eventually they will be able to kill this egg as well you would imagine they're going to try to back off of this
5:25:44
they got the that's everyone that's everybody 1,000 gold given over Teddy
5:25:50
meanwhile zeka why did he sonas Zea there's a cadin oh no and he's going to
5:25:57
go down all of a sudden shut down DRX they don't have the health bars to rush Baron or anything but this game is up in
5:26:04
the air well they're still going to lose Soul what is happening I'm believing
5:26:10
chronicler DRX can do it they've Viper go pick up those
5:26:15
Cinders they're right next to you
5:26:20
so yeah take it away chronicler uh yes please in theory it makes sense to try
5:26:29
and go for a fight like this cuz as long as you trade even slightly okay you will have Tempo to try and make a play
5:26:35
towards Baron there's a reason why on the upcoming patch we're two now now on free they actually add I think it's a
5:26:40
15sec grace period for the withdrawal to ensure that you can't do this the
5:26:45
problem is that must have been a misclick like es especially against
5:26:51
Caitlyn there's absolutely zero way why else you would Zas there so that ends up
5:26:57
being a big shut down they still get the soul point I still don't think for how what this is even close to the end of the world but this is just DRX being
5:27:04
given a real opportunity in this game the gold lead is now negligible uh Yuka is still huge five Stacks Teddy is
5:27:11
getting towards a third item already is yal and his I done DRX can win this game thas and yes
5:27:19
they need to figure out a way to deal with this pesky infernal Drake that's about to come
5:27:25
up so yeah good flash uh if that W connects you do
5:27:30
die I'm I was about to say h do not start Nash but they have a Nia
5:27:38
yeah their turn is kind of just anivia I mean they have pretty good turn no I think the turn's fine it's just the game
5:27:45
is too close now that you can't really Yo Yo's about to hit death cap force it
5:27:51
so Yuko gets death capap teddy gets a third item I you look at peanut he
5:27:59
knows he's been the guy on the other end I don't know what he's saying but he definitely looked nonplused about the
5:28:07
situation 900 gold left for the death cap and we will have it zeka not again
5:28:13
not again Zea not like this I mean they don't have that much damage and he's pretty tanky but like
5:28:20
that's flash yeah the flash just come in The Cask is there and Z is just dead again another pickoff on a zeka who just
5:28:27
can't help it today has like eight or nine deaths
5:28:32
already on today the one upside here is that they can't actually take an
5:28:38
objective because it's towards the B side of the map so they can't Nash getting M lter will be big those
5:28:44
Viper unfaced by everything that's transpiring thus far just uh okay
5:28:51
jumping into aou you know sponge was really good up until that moment he was doing a great
5:28:57
job he set up so many kills got that kill in the bottom Lane and he's like you know what I'm just going to send it
5:29:03
I get the thought process cuz if you kill zenzo you do but z i I know that
5:29:09
well but that's the the thought process is I go in on zenza if we kill him we can Nash because then the jungler is
5:29:16
dead true but now H life can if we go in and kill the whole enemy team we canh
5:29:22
because the RX their jungler is dead yes I can they do this I think they can
5:29:28
honestly and also called Piper going to take him down Teddy he is getting zoned
5:29:34
by anivia but at least zos has to flash away but that just means that rich is going to be the sacrifice instead
5:29:41
Delight oh my um okay I I guess UK has death kep done
5:29:47
this Baron does a lot of damage oh UK can can we please can we can we get some
5:29:52
Vision can we get this men some help oh The Flash Forward uh they might die yeah
5:29:58
this is a very awkward time uh sponge is back and now oh no they didn't they finally killed shal but instead UK goes
5:30:05
down and J is back he's got a she's fail and they will take him out here trying
5:30:11
sponge is trying to kill the baron by himself instead he's just going to elect to die oh maybe he gets away actually a
5:30:17
chance flash a Flash no nice try good effort good effort he
5:30:24
was it meant to be was it good try good try oh I got to vote for p after
5:30:30
this well we know it's not zeka so we've eliminated it's like multiple choice you
5:30:36
know eliminate the option um if Rich gets that body slam do not forget like Z doesn't have his passive
5:30:43
so actually maybe at this point he does was a while back pretty long cool down I
5:30:48
I he must have the way that he was playing and there UK If he actually like if Viper doesn't have a Summoner or if
5:30:54
he's a little bit quicker cuz it looks like they're actually a bit disjointed there if Teddy sponge and Yuka are on
5:30:59
the same page there actually think they can do it uh what if he just killed Zea again unfortunately I don't think that
5:31:05
this time because there's no damage UK joins the rest of the team is there too
5:31:11
oh they 20 seconds Yukon give up this this Dragon oh the Cocoon very nicely done by
5:31:19
delight and I guess that's why we're picking the Le support L cocoon kill
5:31:24
enemy with your carry that's it's as easy as
5:31:30
that can't be How It Ends what do you mean is that it is that how the great resistance great story
5:31:38
of DRX and then the game ended not like this FES EXA just like exactly like what
5:31:46
you're watching right now Z he's just charging forward he has
5:31:51
banshees Veil he's like what are you going to do Andel desperate they want to kill Viper but they can't they just
5:31:57
don't have the damage and I mean there's still an anivia in the front line so they have oodles and Boodles of damage
5:32:03
they get him into the a grit is like man this isn't fair I shouldn't have had to play this game into this bird that's not
5:32:11
that's not a thing should have checked the solo que accounts unlucky well H
5:32:17
life Esports this is the expected result of today I'll say that now we had a lot
5:32:23
of unexpected things that did happen and you can read into that
5:32:28
whatever you may we'll see if we see more anivia in the future here as Zeo will he go down another time no he will
5:32:36
not it is the end of the game Viper ends it with 12 kills as well on the
5:32:42
Ezreal a pretty strong one from [Music]
5:32:48
Hite I need to vote for uh for pom uh is it just
5:32:54
Viper like trying to think back I think his Faris was good as well it's like Viper Zas but Zas did have a little bit
5:33:00
too much fun with this one peanuts a good shout Camille was good I it's either Z
5:33:08
or Viper I think you know I mean this this was a really good game for peanut yeah but might be say both Zas
5:33:16
and Viper had good games in both games right so I I feel like yeah probably one of them I I end up going for Viper and
5:33:24
thinking back to some of the decisions that se has made in this game I feel good about that I think that was the right go uh peanut is saidani his olds
5:33:31
weren't great but never really seemed to be too bothered by anything as angry B
5:33:38
yeah together with head of penguin a classic group Baron No it's h life
5:33:43
Esports I've been making a lot of comments and jokes about you know time periods uh unfortunately for Zea it's
5:33:50
2022 but spring uh not not not worlds as
5:33:56
he really hasn't been able to find his Groove yet this season just looking all over the place and this was a pretty fun
5:34:01
game right like I don't think we should read too much into this but if you take this into the context of how H life has
5:34:07
looked as a team this this split the fact that he got pomed by ji lost to DK as well we can I think at least draw
5:34:14
some initial conclusions and moments like this you can't keep getting away with it
5:34:22
like they won this game yeah but moments like this make you wonder
5:34:27
FES well they're surely able to shore up for him and he has good moments as well it's just some of them look like he's a
5:34:34
bit on Focus right he's kind of just out in the middle of nowhere getting caught stuff like that um Aurora still does a
5:34:42
lot of burst damage especially into squishy AP supports we did learn that as
5:34:48
well Viper he got caught this one time top anivia apparently a thing
5:34:55
especially when you're on red side and you have counterpick for Top Lane a lot of times we're just hand shaking like
5:35:02
you know gante ambessa or or J gante J Gro is Jack you know the same stuff but
5:35:10
if players can actually pull out interesting picks we saw him play Camille and anivia in the Top Lane did
5:35:17
zus so I think it's fair to say that maybe we'll be seeing more interesting picks visiting the Top Lane soon
5:35:26
enough it's an interesting discussion it is I think one of the reasons why Z has
5:35:32
been able to have the performance that he has both in a positive and a negative sense there's been large periods where
5:35:37
just hasn't been able to perform consistently but it's also these moments which is why he is a two time world
5:35:43
champion in the first place right has had really big individual carry moments
5:35:49
throughout the last couple of years and good to see Z up definitely is
5:35:56
going to get a Stern token too I imagine as this game definitely got to
5:36:02
the Wild and wack side but it is still a two Z nothing to see here for life
5:36:07
theight flashing his uh 2022 geni yeah you'll love to see it yeah did more
5:36:14
damage than andil I I guess why yeah we'll be seeing
5:36:19
more of the elite support and you know with blind pick uh
5:36:26
yeah the the blind Caitlyn that came out they were like well let's take the Elise and see what happens if you're a DRX fan
5:36:33
though crazy as it sounds I think there's plenty to be happy about when it
5:36:39
comes to UK's performance when it comes to the team fighting of the team uh the problem I think is just some of the
5:36:44
decision making sponge having a couple of key catches going against him uh andil unfortunately looking too hot but
5:36:51
uh I do know that they have a great support waiting in Challengers as well just in case that they want to you I
5:36:57
want to try something different Fox isn't here but we love to we love to trigger him even from a from afar uh so
5:37:05
it turns out the 22 two 2 and 13 score line was enough it was good enough to
5:37:12
get Viper the player of the match maybe we'll get some media votes for zos I
5:37:17
think zus had a good series you know even though he did do a little bit of trolling you know we all do a little bit of trolling from time to time he played
5:37:23
cille and anivia so the Camille was actually good and the anivia I would just want to vote for cuz I want to
5:37:30
encourage creativity you that's important that has value as well that's why we all love Fearless it's because we
5:37:36
get to see a bunch of different even though it's by no means a necessity yeah
5:37:41
which makes you think maybe we could do this all the time apparently KT have locked in playoffs uh from this one so
5:37:50
congrats to KT yeah with DRX uh not getting the win here even if they would have lost uh two to one it wouldn't have
5:37:57
been enough K uh would overtake thanks to winning the previous series which was
5:38:03
also definitely an experience it's an interesting day today we had a fun day VES I don't know what to think about
5:38:09
this new patch I I think that there's a lot less action and um I hope that we
5:38:15
get more in the future but guys we do have the interview now I'm going to hand it over to Deer for the
5:38:31
translation thank you very much guys this is dear for the LC cup pom
5:38:36
interview trans joined by Viper on the side of Han life
5:38:42
Esports congratulations thank
5:38:49
you so H life Esports get to finish strong in the last group battle match
5:38:55
how do you feel today was our last group battle
5:39:02
match and I feel like our opponents have been very strong and I think we will
5:39:07
just have to keep trying harder and play well moving forward and this is your second time you
5:39:14
got selected as P great asreal skill shots a lot of people are actually
5:39:19
praising your performance so what are your thoughts on your current
5:39:25
gameplay I think I'm playing all right it's pretty
5:39:31
ordinary and I believe that right now I think
5:39:37
there's a lot a lot of way to go and a lot a long way to reach my true potential so yeah I think I just have to
5:39:45
try even harder from now on so you're consistently doing so well
5:39:51
so what is your secret to be
5:39:58
honest I don't consider that my performance was so that great I think I
5:40:05
just have to focus on what's important which is finishing strong until the very
5:40:11
end so I think so far it's too early to say
5:40:17
I think I just have to win a lot more Cloud Templar even said that you
5:40:23
know Viper please take me in as an apprentice what are your thoughts you know I don't really have
5:40:29
any thoughts on or any future plans on taking in an apprentice but maybe I'll
5:40:36
think about in the future and Ania made an appearance in game
5:40:43
two this is actually in the lck history the first top anivia so was this a
5:40:50
planned pick or a decision made on the spot I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say
5:40:57
this but yeah this is something that we did
5:41:04
plan and practice and this isn't my l so I can't really say for sure but I think
5:41:11
it's a really good champion and given that there's a lot of Lane swaps I think
5:41:17
just the kit that Ania has she prevents a lot of really good like dive
5:41:25
attemps but I feel like we didn't really get to see a lot of these sort of moments where Olivia
5:41:34
survives but I think in the future I think think we'll be able to Showcase even better performances with these sort
5:41:42
of picks as a
5:41:49
team and today is Z's birthday did you say happy birthday oh no not
5:41:57
yet well this is would be a great moment to tell him happy
5:42:03
birthday yeah I was aware that it was his birthday and a lot of things on on on
5:42:08
the on the line with the today's match and so I'd like to say thank you for
5:42:14
doing so well today happy birthday and to climb higher from now on
5:42:21
you will take part in the plans what are your
5:42:27
goals like I've said a lot of people or a lot of teams are actually performing very
5:42:33
well so we have to come up with a bunch of different comps that we can continue
5:42:41
using in The Fearless strap to do well and that's the end of the interview with Viper and back to the space thank
5:42:51
you well there you have it a clean two nothing to see here you know what it's
5:42:58
actually great to know that our heroes are kind of like us as Hana life Esports take the victory in this series close
5:43:05
the door on DRX welcome back to the space for the final time tonight Deon alongside with did and wolf and uh
5:43:13
anivia top that has to be the talking point right uh either that or like do you guys think that at any point um
5:43:19
there were some uh uh you know Gallo respawning in 47 seconds 4 46 seconds 45
5:43:25
seconds spam was going into the chat yeah uh it's been a while since we've
5:43:32
seen anivia um you can see this is actually played uh by a fra um and a
5:43:38
loss versus chovi and uh back in 2020 um something
5:43:44
that Zas has been playing in Solo W looked it up he went for the tank build something that uh he's been working on
5:43:50
maybe cooking up I mean he's really into anevia by the way he was also playing it
5:43:55
on me as well so definitely it's one of the pokeat pick from Zeus you're going to see it more for for the B5 series and
5:44:03
yeah uh not sure about that one I it didn't work out that well but I mean it's really exciting exciting to see
5:44:10
that uh especially in the fist draft yeah I mean I thought it was just exciting to see Chronicle bis's brain
5:44:17
trying to process what was happening each step of the way they're not going to pick a de okay it's not going to go top okay what is happening what's
5:44:25
happening is Viper getting all the votes here another 11 of 11 great job right
5:44:30
media and left media and VN cast and my analysts here and everyone that got the
5:44:35
vote like until like about 15 minutes into that game I was feeling like oh it's going to be an animus as well it's
5:44:41
easy but then it became about Viper and I think everybody kind of forgot what
5:44:47
happened in the early game very quickly um I I I think he's VIP Viper um
5:44:53
otherwise known as vipper uh in this case oh my God because he was the most important person that did all the damage
5:44:59
and actually really wanted to win the game really badly the rest of his teammates sometimes did but uh he he did the whole time I mean did they tried
5:45:07
hard enough I I'm not sure by the way like maybe uh this is the one uh that
5:45:13
maybe Viper wants to just old CH like what is happening like clown Fiesta solo game
5:45:20
like kind of similar but anyways they are new big three team right so I'm
5:45:26
really confused what what is happening you know so that's why I put on this I see I see I see well uh you know who
5:45:33
also knew what was happening the guy that was casting it right in the front line what' cronnie say that was a fun Swift play game the new
5:45:40
mode that you can play now in the client get you in get you out very uh faster
5:45:46
gold generation let's see what the Korean uh broadcast had to say here this
5:45:52
is how you play poke that's what he took away from this series you know like
5:45:57
Korean side always tried to make it better you know like always tried to make the players look better but we
5:46:03
always fail cuz we really can't analyze this kind of game you know yeah it was messy um let's see what the
5:46:09
last one is I'm the god of AD carry Viper that's true um Prince uh really
5:46:15
wanted to say it about himself but yeah I was like is that I'm the god of AD Cary Viper or I'm the god of AD actually
5:46:22
it's me by the way uh this is this is a meme based on
5:46:28
the AI generated song about Viper J oh release it by Han life gon had to
5:46:34
clarify that one before we you know started some prints pper beef from the global broadcast no no no Prince is I
5:46:40
just I don't know I wanted to meme because Prince is like great 80 carry himself of course from the old days he
5:46:45
got most predictions for the last week so it does make sense all right let's take a look at the highlights here from
5:46:51
this one there are a lot that we could have pull yeah it's one of the great moment that they had like using anevia
5:46:59
uh correctly but I think y call had great moment here to use his ultimate
5:47:05
but he didn't use it so that's why they kind of split it but obviously they had
5:47:10
one moment right yeah you know this it's like the Fairly Odd Parents meme where ando's like this is where I'd use my ult
5:47:16
if I had level six he's level four and he can't use it and so his positioning
5:47:22
was otherwise good but then the rest of the team is cut off here and niia is very good at isolating uh targets and
5:47:28
killing them and so yeah Great Wall as well yep big burst damage yeah but
5:47:35
anyways that it was only yuk call that who can actually Trigg pull the trigger right there but it didn't happen so
5:47:41
level four ano and level five by couldn't do anything you know that wasn't exactly
5:47:48
how that fight was supposed to go so we have another highlight that shows exactly why this team comp was picked
5:47:53
here by Han life Esports uh again no way in for DRX in this fight yeah and also
5:48:00
two Manning the aacon as Andel is trying to get some information let's say uh a
5:48:07
little bit I think desperate here he did get information they're here guys yeah
5:48:12
he he did find out um at the cost of his life uh of course this play from UK
5:48:17
means that it's kind of a 4v4 because Delight is essentially out of this one and you can see the zoning here is just
5:48:24
uh look at Ania ulti what can you do against that yeah I mean those are those
5:48:29
are Teddy's traps but like no one is really trying to walk towards DRX as it turns out
5:48:37
yeah I I remember one time uh back in the day we tried like anevia Graves you
5:48:42
know to block the lane completely but you have aan Wall to help that out so I
5:48:48
think that's kind of idea that zos had probably yeah and then you know then we have some like fun times here can we
5:48:55
skip this like Oh no
5:49:00
just close your eyes erase this one from your memories no you know it it's only
5:49:05
100 gold more more than last week like Valdez said to 1,000 gold hang on over
5:49:11
Zea also after that goes in yeah zonia so gets trapped after losing his res
5:49:19
comes in and dies as well it was a little bit bizarre let's forget that that that's too much short-term memory
5:49:25
let's go back to the long-term memory cuz again as Jon brought up on the broadcast to Valdez it was 2009 when
5:49:34
anivia was created and we figured which show some of our photos from 2009 that's
5:49:40
me winning a wing eating contest in college uh I
5:49:46
beat I feel like I beat like 50 people at a wing eating contest that's 2009
5:49:52
this was like you D DJing or something no there's like you there's like paper
5:49:58
on my neck like uh the uh oh the bib yeah I had a little bib going on there
5:50:04
uh that is Mr Brendan Valdez looks looks like he just got done
5:50:10
playing some solo queue yeah there he is um could could could have just been
5:50:15
yesterday with uh old webcam proba oh yeah no way look at those
5:50:22
glasses no way baby b in by the way it's not exactly 2009 I
5:50:30
can't really find out like 2009 picture but it's one of the my old memories one of the cringe selfie I'll wait till you
5:50:37
see mine W oh you look handsome you look like a stylish guy like all
5:50:42
[Applause] the I don't remember where I was going
5:50:49
or what I was doing but it's good actually I had really long ha back then
5:50:55
yeah uh and it was a lot bler it looks so good like it looks so young and Wild
5:51:00
and Free look at the old cameras well you know great this 2009 was a different
5:51:06
year it was a different Year and that was when the bird was released we haven't really seen it in a little while
5:51:11
nib coming back bringing back great memories and victory for Hana life
5:51:17
Esports as they go up 3 to2 and now we have solidified our playoffs for our
5:51:23
group Elder squads it is KT that will sneak on into that playoff spot and DRX
5:51:30
will go to plins they will sit at 3 and two no matter what so now they have to go up against all 3 and2 two and threes
5:51:39
and maybe a one and four Squad in group Barrett I mean after today's Reser uh
5:51:45
bfx versus nonam is going to be more exciting and yeah I mean for to tomorrow
5:51:51
it's going to be more Banger as though yeah okay the second match up we've talked about it forever and all that like it's bro versus
5:51:58
D+ do T1 start smash that's the real question on everyone's mind right now I
5:52:03
hope so because I really want to see this team give him the toughest challenge yet to see if he's up for it
5:52:08
and I think all the testing they've done leading up to this gives him that opportunity he's he's had some confident
5:52:14
play I think he's been very strong so far T1 might be able to do this I predicted them I'm feeling really good
5:52:20
about their chances but it's going to be a sick best of three yeah huge huge game there and again bro waiting room until
5:52:26
that moment all right we got a lot of matches for you tomorrow all of them matter make sure to stick around on
5:52:32
