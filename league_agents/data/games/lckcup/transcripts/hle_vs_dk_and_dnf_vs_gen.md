26:45
[Music] good afternoon and welcome to another
26:53
day of the 2025 lck cup I am Valdez with me is ax today and our first match is
27:01
especially enticing here aux we got DK up against H life Esports a couple of
27:06
teams that are two favorites to do quite well here at the cup yeah I think everyone's expectation for H was really
27:13
high in terms of the roster they have some hiccups so far but I think D+ I
27:18
think it's pretty easy to say they've been the best performing team so far in the lck cup you know we've seen some struggles with Gen against bro um which
27:26
is kind of dropped them down a p or two so I I really think Plus have stood out they haven't been infallible I mean no
27:33
team has but really in good form and undefeated so far yeah DK looking great I think that Fearless has really let
27:40
them shine as well I don't feel like they even really needed Fearless but they're using it as an excuse to pick a
27:46
bunch of cool things and make great compositions and really showcase their incredible Champion pools and they have
27:52
not lost as you mentioned H life Esports they did lose as they got absolutely J
27:58
flattened by gen that's where we were like oh wow J's really really strong H life will'll have to see where they go
28:05
but things have changed since then yeah I mean the titans of bro had to you know
28:11
show geni their place yeah I mean this one obviously group ELD is still a good amount ahead of group Baron um so it's
28:19
going to take a lot for group Baron to catch up from here but matches like this where it's two opponents so close together are where group Baron can find
28:26
an edge like H definitely capable of beaten D+ but we need to see them in form we need to see them playing at a
28:32
better level than in some of the Series this year yeah and you know at first it looked like it was just dunzo for group
28:38
Baron but we got nine matches left there is absolutely comeback potential one
28:43
side will lose which team will keep their streak can DK The Undefeated stop the orange tank on their way to their
28:50
third consecutive Victory we don't have a Saturday Showdown for the lck cup that
28:56
will come back in the lck but uh whatever they would play in the Saturday Showdown H sports that is it
29:02
would be orange day so technically Orange Day for them and they are the
29:07
orange tank we'll see if that extra bit of power can help them across the line but I really liked the drafting
29:14
specifically you know you've got the lwm barrel back on the team for DK you've got the super rookie in the Top Lane in
29:20
shiu and it's really just rounded out this roster in a fantastic way yeah and I think particularly for me when we talk
29:26
about the draft in the mid jungle a lot of flexing there in terms of what picks they're able to play uh I think this is
29:31
really cool you know see going up against Z and has said specifically how he is his role model how he wanted to
29:37
play against him inspired him to become a pro player uh yeah I mean really cool
29:42
and hopefully he puts on a good performance he gets to he gets to rise up for the challenge yeah think about you when I first saw him I'm like oh boy
29:49
this guy's really nervous I don't know if he's going to be able to make it happen on stage and then he just proved me totally wrong he was like no I yeah I
29:56
look nervous but I play like like I'm a veteran I play like I don't make mistakes I'm always doing the right
30:02
thing and you need that when you're going up against someone like Z as the bot Lane is key the total head-to-head
30:09
aiming is ahead 35 to 24 and does have the current total first KDA certainly
30:16
helps that he has not lost yet yeah and you know aiming I think last year uh in
30:22
summer in particular really had a strong performance with D+ has started off the season in a similar manner
30:28
Viper though I feel like Viper of all the 0 carries in the league was the person I feel like in Fearless I have the most faith in to be able to lean
30:34
into you know even outside of traditional lady carries and the Mages it be interested to see what does come
30:40
up here well let's see how it goes as the two teams are walking out here do we
30:47
have any Shenanigans I will say that DK always brings a giant fan base they've
30:52
been one of the teams that has really grown I would say in terms of their fan base
30:59
and today yeah we're on the DK side again seems like we're always on the DK side for some reason and uh we'll see
31:06
how that goes for them but H life Esports this is a powerful roster when we first saw it the addition of zus
31:14
absolutely excellent and yeah you know there's there's been some ups and downs for sure but still looking very strong
31:21
yeah I mean that geni series obviously geni played extremely well but H really looked out of sorts but you know this is
31:27
the raining lck Champions adding Z to the mix really just makes them uh even
31:33
more of a threat so once they figure out how to fit him into how their team plays once they sort of sort things out I
31:39
really have a lot of confidence this team will be performing uh at a really high level say's hair is growing out a
31:45
little bit he feels a little bit less embarrassed about it covering it a lot less of and um how long will he grow it
31:53
out I do wonder will he just go back to the normal and then keep it that way or maybe this is opportunity to try
31:58
something totally new I I think you should go for the mullet
32:04
personally yeah you know what if you want you can just go down there and tell them your thoughts you can let them know
32:10
right now yeah right now I'll I'll cover go down there I'll cover in the meantime I think it' be you think they'll let me on stage important information what do
32:17
you think would happen if I just walked on stage right now don't let the intrusive thought win Brandon would they
32:22
stop me or would they just be like wait what's going on keep them a bay keep the intrusive thoughts a bay okay um we
32:28
don't need to find the answer to that question if I had a mic they would definitely let me on the stage but uh
32:35
yeah I'm not going to try it I'd rather just cast the draft I think that's not going to try that's a good what a
32:40
fantastic idea maybe next time give it a shot perhaps not Perhaps
32:46
Perhaps not um I think we're fine here I think we're fine the cameraman I do this
32:51
a great job of showing us all the players we don't need to get up close and person Well everybody's looking pretty
32:57
happy today on the stage you know uh the weekends do start a little bit earlier
33:04
but everybody seems awake ready to go it's not too early you know we're not starting at like 11:00 a.m. that's that
33:09
would be just ridiculous for orts times but uh 3:00 p.m. definitely a pretty
33:17
comfortable start for these guys they can get dinner afterwards very comfortably you know sometimes if you're
33:22
playing like the second series and it goes late it can go until like 11 12 and then you're like well yeah I feel like
33:28
if you ask the average League player if they're up at 11:00 a.m. they're like there's no there's 11: a.m.
33:34
now got a chance in the world actually I mean maybe if they they
33:39
stayed up all night playing that's the only way they get into 11:00 a.m. you know uh I have done it before gamer
33:45
hours yeah how you all in our youth yes how life Esports do have the
33:52
side selection and they will go for the blue side only nine more group stage matches
33:58
left in the lck cup before we get into play-ins and then into uh playoffs of
34:05
course can hli Esports try to drag group Baron up a bit more
34:10
tonight yeah so a lot of weight on D+ in these bands being on red side uh scner
34:18
is the must band when you're on red side kti's very high ban priority as well so might get taken
34:23
away uh H people's deciding to Target the VI obviously Lucid has said before
34:29
think he is the best VI in the lck and has honestly lived up to that title a fair few times so andessa is going to be
34:37
denied Zyra taken away from peanut kalista still open right
34:43
now see what they do here also yon has been a pretty popular ban against H life Esports obviously having both Zea and
34:50
Zas the double Z's both good at yon um can cause a lot of problems Cante and
34:55
ambessa banned away Jas is tired of the Champions with a a million dashes in the
35:03
Top Lane he doesn't want any of that yeah uh y still one that does have a at
35:09
least a couple of dashes will it get targeted here is it kalista is it
35:14
something like a rumble that gets through uh that certainly a lot of power
35:19
picks still available when you're Banning something like the Zyra so kalista is the choice the poppy also
35:26
still available it's not going to be prioritize for peanut but they are going to pick up the Jace first we have seen
35:32
that Jace even with unending despair not being able to be picked up it doesn't matter he is still very strong yeah
35:39
still very popular um and on top of that uh other things
35:45
that been left open obviously the rumble but also the Ash and the virus uh can see them potentially traded off we've
35:50
seen people prioritize the virus especially if you're in a window where you can go the Poke virus can be quite hard for ash to play the game uh you
35:57
need to get up into order range and varus can just que from a mile away can struggle into those tankier champs as
36:02
well and again we've seen this tank Chase could also be you know mid lane Jace we've seen it go more the Poke
36:07
build a little bit Bruiser H nidle will come through so the potential to lean quite heavily into poke ready for D+ and
36:15
uh Lucid repping the N I've seen that from him before with some strong
36:21
performances and there goes the draft uh
36:28
not sure where it went maybe he's taking a little bit of a break um but hopefully
36:34
he comes back yeah um not sure I I mean I I'm looking on stage I can see that
36:40
the players are still in the draft so probably just uh bit of a small whoopsie
36:48
try to keep you maybe we'll do it here on the uh oh okay so this is what
36:53
happened it was a rumble selection not a nly selection uh okay and that is uh the
37:00
issue looks like Ezreal selected on the other side because right now we've got the draft
37:06
going guys so just a little bit of an issue we'll we'll try to keep you updated here we go we got the we got the
37:12
old okay yeah got the old one uh at least you can see it on it back out so Rumble
37:19
has come through so a little bit different don't have the N don't have that fast clear but a lot of power uh in
37:24
the Top Lane Pig Zoe Pig Zoey secure that or y y is they'll take the Y
37:31
themselves so not the ban it and confident to take it away obviously a pick that you often see into air quite
37:38
popular there and Viper did secure that e for himself so something they can play quite safely quite uh at a a long range
37:46
and it definitely feels like so far D+ they have tools they have strong ultimates they can get on top of this
37:51
back line of h a lot of power a lot of safety in this H backline you have the Ezreal and the AIA a lot of Mobility a
37:59
lot of range to play at uh and the Jace likely will be that Bruiser at least if not tank Jace so not the easiest Target
38:06
to get on top of now you see this Sani denied I feel like honestly D+ maybe
38:11
could have got a look in on that um especially pairing up with the Y but fighting against
38:17
it yeah it is pretty interesting I do wonder what kind of jungler they are
38:23
going to go for if they're banning suani away from you know know azir and Jace at
38:30
least banned away and we are so
38:36
back yeah at least support Deni from Barrel the guy who can die nine times and still win um so not want to give
38:43
that one over uh obviously a lot of early power and also part of it being you know if it comes to that fourth pick
38:49
D plus could take it away initially or they can even leave it to a counter pick so a lot of threat there H Wukong going
38:55
to get taken away as well definitely saw H cuz have a lot of value on that when it was like wukan Ari so a lot of dive
39:02
potential but also can work in a defensive manner if you're diving into him he can uh use his clone to get like
39:07
the double SS so uh zenza open available something we've seen very popular in the
39:12
jungle so maybe D+ lean in that direction I mean the N is also just available um
39:21
although I feel like they don't really have the setup for it uh in that composition so not a huge fan hasn't
39:26
stopped team before has definitely not stopped teams before but this could be
39:31
interesting looking at the lein potentially why does it feel like it's
39:37
Lucid asking Barrel what he's playing okay LLY comes in so uh decent amount of
39:43
poke decent amount of pressure and especially I mean we've seen nli do well in the Zyra but nli is a fast clearer um
39:52
and should be able to outpace for example as zzza which is the highest picked jungler on the in the lck cup and
39:58
will be picked up by peanut uh now support picks they end up going for the poppy so again decent
40:05
amount of Peel definitely playing that more defensive game uh I feel like the value is not spectacular here on it but
40:10
the assumption is that when you have a ital when you have things like a rumble as well def are likely going to want
40:16
lock down and engage from their support pick you know I I'm thinking things like the real being available and I think
40:22
that prob that Proby is like a preemptive this is what we expect so we're going to deny in advance
40:28
uh and I actually think this is a pretty heads up pick so the maai works well specifically because it is an Engaged
40:35
pick you know it it is providing what D+ needs but it's not really counteracted by poppy there's not much poppy can do
40:41
to stop what aalai does whereas if you pick something like the ra like Alister you're kind of playing into delight's
40:47
hand with what he's already taken so I think makes sense a lot of CC being offered by the bot Lane which is important when we have this n and it
40:54
definitely feels like when we get to these team fights it's going to be about D Plus trying to connect onto this backline get on these critical carries
41:00
uh and hanai feast Sports trying to deny that yeah they also just have a a lot of
41:06
damage from range themselves we've uh seen Jay and maai many times paired up
41:11
before but thing about you know Rumble alt in Mount KAAL you've got a y or a n
41:17
spear to hop in a varis q to land while people are rooted or stuck in place or slowed by saplings you know it does feel
41:24
like both sides are kind of keeping each other at of distance obviously D DK has
41:29
a lot of ways to close that distance as well so should be a pretty fun one
41:34
actually I I think that both teams have really gotten a lot of power picks in this draft it is the first draft
41:41
of uh the by the way it is lucid's birthday that's what that says uh he is
41:47
uh looking to carry today didn't it say the 28th of the fif so in a few
41:52
days yes yeah but celebrating it today cuz this is the closest mat that's
41:57
that's fair enough you know just clarify but I'm glad I'm glad you clarify thank you a and guys it looks like we are
42:04
ready to hop on the RO for game number
42:18
[Applause] one all righty game number one H life
42:25
Esports versus D plus Kia on paper this one looks like the more competitive of
42:30
the two series we have today as level one barrel just having a bit of fun as
42:37
he does yeah really nice queue from Barrel just completely disengaging the situation peut going the audacious
42:42
charge which does have a slow attached to it so there was potential for something uh doesn't end up paying off
42:49
and nothing has to be burn from D Plus on top of that we see aiming move in and get a pretty deep Ward around the bot
42:55
Lane uh does like look like we're going to end up in a swap
43:01
situation uh on the back of this and not only is a swap situation
43:06
but looks like Z is going to assist peanut with clearing out these botside camps uh and seeing if they can try and
43:14
get these away before like the map split pressure comes in but it looks like on the other side D plus are kind of doing something similar actually walking into
43:20
a trap uh-oh and it's level one between these two but it's still going to be a hell of
43:27
a lot of zoning uh already but zos he got the grasp uh proc y got something
43:33
out of the trade did have bone plating there just to mitigate a bit of the damage you know obviously a popular option when you know you in these pop
43:40
situations um but the health being lower does mean if he does end up going bot later is in a vulnerable spot we're
43:46
seeing shed XP in the mid lane to try and help these top laners out yeah you know just a little 2v2
43:54
action a couple of solo laners together a zero on a six game winning streak um
44:00
just when we thought you know it's Fearless we're getting rid of him at least we will get rid of him for the next couple of games you know what I
44:05
think is part of that yeah uh oh he's tping down immediately are they going to look for a
44:11
dive I mean it is maai is pretty good at diving and at least trading very
44:16
aggressively you see he drops aggro by hitting the minion and now he's got you who's level one but I think this might
44:23
be enough damage the Harpoon is going to miss though and Barrel flashes away he's in a lot of trouble oh he got first
44:30
Blood he's able to get it anyway peanut of course will be able to take him down
44:36
but at least the feed of strength does go over to DK and on top of that because Z TP to the bot Lane even though it's a
44:43
one for one Z missed a lot of experience there so not an ideal situation for
44:50
H uh this is kind of the thing with maai it's so easy to drop the tower aggro they go for the initial dive they get a
44:55
good amount of damage barl Dodges away from that second tower shot and then they just go for the redive uh and Z
45:03
justes buy a lot of time I think Su being level one not a great contributor to this play uh and then peanut coming
45:10
around gets a kill NOS he's dead but his job has been done yeah zus waited until the very end
45:17
to flash um you know maybe could have Dodge like a second Harpoon and
45:23
potentially trying to survive another turret but it's a pretty dire situation so I don't even really blame him for
45:29
that uh looking to save his Flash and then flash towards the end thinking he could get away this time though he
45:34
doesn't have Flash and that's in Italy with red buff uh he's not getting away from this the knock back is going to be
45:40
critical but does he even have it the answer is he's not going to use it if he did and down he goes That's Another kill
45:46
as Lucid is just hunting him down yeah another thing as well normally we think about having like you know double AP
45:52
like AP jungle AP in a Solo Lane you know you can itemize against EAS here but the harpoons reduce magic resist as
45:59
well so you know in these situations before Z has any magic resist it's really brutal when see connects those
46:07
andus getting off to an even better start this Jace already 02 and one not the start you
46:12
wanted yeah I mean he is just eventually going to be
46:17
tanky and kind of do his thing so it doesn't feel as bad as like a lethality beas That Gets behind perhaps but it
46:24
still feels pretty bad like there's nothing really uh good about this situation for zus and even showmakers
46:31
doing a good job of taking trades here against Zea I say that and immediately Zea gets a great trade and the grass
46:37
proc so we're saying I mean we saw how you know a is on a six win streak but I
46:43
do think a caveat to that is what match up do we often see corki air against
46:48
corki and corki is zero and 12 so I I do think that might be a factor in why's
46:53
stats are looking so good H not that the pick isn't strong but uh yeah if anyone
46:59
picks Corky today I don't care who it is even if it's geni in the next series I am putting all of my channel points on
47:05
the enemy team I'm going to open up my phone and put it all on the other team I
47:10
mean it's zero trou it's not like it's just suddenly start winning right well
47:15
it's also gambler's fallacy you know it's lost so many times it's got to win this time right at least that's how I
47:22
think the teams are thinking about it when they pick it for the 12th time like I can fix it yeah
47:29
exactly um no I don't think I don't think he's fixable at this point guys uh
47:35
talking to the LC teams little plane is broken down yeah I think he needs a buff needs an engine Wick or just as whated
47:42
has been saying every single time just play him in bot Lane instead if you already play him I don't think he needs a buff I think just don't play him it's
47:47
fine for corki not to be in the meta I'm completely okay with that I haven't seen enough corki personally um you know that
47:54
one season that I was a part of where it was a z corki almost single every every single game it wasn't enough for me uh
48:01
the grubs here are going to be taken by H life V Sports Lucid is nearby and he would love to deny one they've gotten
48:09
two without smiting though so the third is an easy pick up three grubs secured H Le so they do get the contribution
48:14
towards the fza strength uh and yeah a nice little addition to get oh that recoil gets stopped doesn't get stopped
48:22
uh so Viper avoids that but aiming I mean last year he was a gold
48:28
uh old habits die hard uh just spend his time but getting some plating getting some extra Farm uh it's on a huge lead
48:36
over Viper right now but has pulled ahead a little bit there uh but his pressure wasn't there for the grub so de
48:42
was really not interested in fighting it yeah I think that's okay you know he's going to go back pick up a Durk and a
48:49
long sword and thought maybe he was going to get something else but just uh running back
48:55
to Lane here it is just going to end up being normal Lanes by the end of it all and we can kind of take stock of where
49:01
we're at the three grubs did go to H life Esports but DK are in the lead with the first blood and that extra kill that
49:08
they did get onto their nit which uh we weren't super happy about I think the
49:14
Bai certainly helps it out a lot but especially because you think about the Synergy you've got traps you've got
49:20
saplings you have a ton of brush control a lot of ways to get Vision so just
49:25
together even if you're not you know Landing giant nid Spears it just has a lot of synergy anyway as peanut level
49:33
six is going to find the n and push him away I think it's one of these things where if people get ahead and get
49:39
control is going to be really obnoxious dealing with that um but definitely N is a pick where one behind feels quite
49:44
underwhelming even the maai support if it falls behind just feels very squishy we'll see how that goes in oh
49:52
all right well he's just going to Al away so Al for Al trade very nicely buffered there by
49:58
showmaker and no problem for him at all yeah and moved up for that play So I
50:05
mean it's not like VIP is going to miss much but getting zoned out of the moment gives a little window where maybe D+ H potenti look towards the dragon and
50:13
it looks like that is what they will do so even though you know it's not like zeka it was an Al for ult trade it's not
50:19
like he committed anything more but the light moving up towards the mid lane and also the fact that aiming has his
50:25
additional pressure he's level six he has does result in D plus just getting a free Dragon Mountain as well pretty nice
50:31
one to pick up Bailey and it's mountain and we got hex
50:36
tech on the way next so might be a weaker Soul honestly on the back of that
50:42
uh kind of liking infernal I think cloud is also pretty good but you think about
50:48
chemtech and ocean yeah I mean not great not a lot of Tanks
50:55
either oh that's what I kind of miss yeah I mean I think the ocean value is okay cuz there
51:00
a decent amount of poke but it's definitely not going to be as good as uh a lot of the others and more pressure
51:07
come down the bot Lane H are swapping the bot Lane up towards the top side for these grubs that they want to prioritize
51:14
but you know when you go over these rotations and you don't have the priority you're just suffering every
51:19
time like aiming is picking up more more plates on the bot Lane uh Z just get a decent amount of damage back but I I
51:26
mean this feels like an even easier dive setup than we saw before the route is going to land Z nice flash away from the
51:33
spear I just don't know if it matters though because another spear is coming and maai is here as in they go with the
51:38
damage Barr flashes away we got to dive in the Top Lane to in a lot of trouble here against three but peanut tanking up
51:44
the turret shots and it gets traded back as yes Viper picks up a kill but so does
51:50
sh in the top lanane one of these situations where you're so used to like the amount of damage the tower does and
51:56
the buff just catching peut off got it I I don't think it was by a large margin they did enough damage to kill him but
52:02
it ramps up so quickly in here a takes the window when Z doesn't expect it to throw the ult down get some damage in
52:09
and be the Flash and the barrel here flashes out doesn't risk it doesn't take the extra hit uh which is a good call
52:15
when you see how much damage he did there to aiming in here you know peut tries to play the am tank in the tower
52:20
I'm just going to walk out on the last hit there's a great flash there from SE to avoid the stun from Delight and then
52:26
peanut here I mean that must have just killed him but
52:31
definitely uh the improved Towers the more damage they have catch him up guard yeah now you look at DK's position they
52:38
traded better in the dive situation they're going to get all three grubs for themselves that's a second look at that
52:45
objective there for the fatza strength and they're very close to getting the bottom turret already and aiming is
52:52
getting solo time with the top turret here let's see how much and Viper can do
52:57
down here but there's no wave with the equalizer another one coming in should
53:02
just be able to clear this one out and it just feels like H being handled at
53:08
every turn you know the fact that they swapped their bot Lan up towards the top side they wanted priority on the grubs
53:13
cuz p goes down they lose out on that and you know the gold lead isn't crazy it's not like this game is is doomed for
53:20
H anything but this has been a really positive start for D+
53:26
it it's been massive like they they have the first dragon they're ahead on Feats of Strength they have so much gold into
53:34
their uh varis who aiming has 121 CS he's ahead by 30 Cs on viper going to
53:41
catch up a little bit here but he's also just got so many plates that's why the difference is almost 1,000 even though
53:48
they both have a kill just SOL of that extra objective gold going over to aiming so he hits his first item quicker
53:55
and is going to be a real man Menace when it does come to some of these uh fights we're going to have in a bit like
54:00
over the rift Herald over the max Dragon potentially oh man I mean obviously see
54:06
we're not really in a position to kill him especially with old but just the fact that he has that much pressure you
54:11
know it really feels like H just on the back foot uh Z 031 not ideal and the
54:17
thing is there's no one really who wants to go up against aiming cuz at the point he's at now his poke is really severe uh
54:23
Jace isn't really tanky yet and everyone else will just get kind ofad melted yeah everybody is melting Viper
54:30
is just sitting back as far as he possibly can showmaker though is going to dodge back but Delight is here the
54:36
knockup comes in Flash away as Zea is's tanking the turet and showmaker still
54:42
gets away and he will survive we got a TP coming in see looking to potentially
54:48
punish this a lot of health bars are pretty low up here but they're going to get the first turret actually so life
54:54
Esports pretty good spot as long long as Z Can Get Out Alive the light sticking
55:00
around but yeah the TP goes and they get away he definitely a little bit conservative there like pathing a little
55:07
bit of free just to completely cut them off but uh don't end up finding what they want
55:13
there even though showmaker survives H still getting some pressure down on the bot side but mid aiming once again going
55:20
to be look to pick up more plates he was a bit angry that he didn't get gold King last week I feel we're see
55:26
play he wants to secure it it's taken by jiu actually um so pretty funny uh another
55:34
ad80 carry does kind of make sense but yeah he's just getting he got like three plates bot three plates top and three
55:40
plates mid peanut has to Al kind of an awkward spot for him yeah Miss Al there
55:46
from aiming but I mean you force the Zen so not not too much of an issue like regardless of the fact you missed it uh
55:53
if out I don't think you really have the damage to immediately kill so just a trade there and uh yeah I mean overall
56:00
plate gold pretty even to be honest but it's kind of more distributed for the side of
56:05
H uh and I think some of it not picked up as well Pat and strength by the way picked
56:12
up here by DK they got that uh dragon and it is in ocean soul so we'll see if
56:19
they can pick up a bunch to help against the pooke that's really going to be the main thing here but yeah feat of strength as they do pick up three grubs
56:25
and two drag so DK will secure that for the team they get the
56:31
sandals we might have a a moment here where yes we do have the rift tald spawning in a minute but especially with
56:38
the fza strength down we'll see how hard DK do want to fight over this objective yeah I think for breaking midt one
56:44
definitely a lot of value um for both sides but I think honestly Hing a bit of
56:50
a rough position right now we do see that Zas has gone for the hold breaker first so I me we've seen him pick up the hold breaker before but we' seen we got
56:56
like shoin fimble winter hole breaker whereas now he's making it like paintly
57:02
clear his role is to be a menace in the side lane eventually he'll become bulky enough that like see won't be able to
57:07
cut through him and he'll have a hard time in the 1 V one and I think that is just H's intent play through
57:13
sides uh in the long term obviously they could send showmaker against s and the blade R and king would cut through him
57:20
pretty effectively yeah it definitely would and we take a look here at the difference in
57:26
the 8 carries this is what we were mentioning and now we've got the lock down the shin out pretty good to stop a
57:31
lot of the incoming damage and the pop but it just doesn't matter they outnumber peanut in the river and they
57:38
do take him down as Lucid yeah he was you know punted away but that doesn't
57:43
really matter as they're going to get peanut right before the rift tur spawns so excellent timing here as well for DK
57:50
yep some good setup and I mean one of the problems with H's composition really is you don't have that clear snap engage
57:57
where you just see a Target kill a Target you know you have to find a good angle theight to knock somebody into a
58:02
wall P needs to stack up his a knockup before it actually takes effect whereas on the other side Barrel presses are
58:09
that's a kill you know it's that easy if you have the followup yeah that's why that maai last pick we were very
58:15
impressed by it because it really just rounds out the composition you don't really want to play an engage support but you need an engage support so what
58:21
do you want do you want to go for some kind of engage enchanter the answer was no we'll just play maai and it works out
58:28
perfectly here yeah there's really just not much Kina can do in this situation car though also doing a great job with
58:34
the Twisted Advance there dodging the knockup from the poppy I don't think it was needed but why not show off yeah you
58:42
can see he was waiting you know he he could have pressed it immediately but instead he was like no no no Poppy's right there Barrel so far has been very
58:49
impressive I I think that a lot of times in spring in the past with the old
58:54
format he's been kind of just having fun and that's fine but he's
59:01
really locked in at the beginning of lck cup he's been having a a great performance so far so but also having
59:07
fun having a little bit of fun I mean he did have that Elise game but there have also been games where he's been kind of
59:13
carrying and here we got showmaker right on top of Z the ult is well committed to
59:18
barely not enough damage and zeka gets away but still feeling the pain of just
59:25
yion existing you know what that is that is honestly the difference between having resolve and the extra HP from
59:30
those runes you know leandre's faar is a bit bulkier so showmaker just not having enough damage to take him
59:38
down Herold thrown down mid not a huge amount of value that Tower is really low
59:43
already but they'll happily knock it down uh and now it's going to be really difficult for Viper because he's just
59:48
going to get poked out by aiming doesn't have the safety of a turret to retreat to and those arrows from the varus going
59:56
to really start hitting especially as that manam mun's nearly stacked up already finished from
1:00:02
aiming yeah he's chilling he has a ton of support especially in the top side of the map the bottom side of the map he's
1:00:08
got one in the enemy jungle a ward that is so he can just Farm out very uh
1:00:13
safely Zas is going to be down here picking up this turret and Viper so far
1:00:19
he is still as real so even though you know aiming could potentially poke him out Viper's just saying okay I respect
1:00:24
you entirely you got a level on me let's take a look at this play uh I think I yeah I stopped his
1:00:32
back is what he said and then
1:00:37
oh low so close so close see the emotions
1:00:44
just roller coastering had to use the ult to delay the snap back and uh just
1:00:50
unfortunately didn't quite have enough uh then a good attempt you know keeping Zea
1:00:57
on his toes Zea no stranger to yon's Kit that's for sure yeah I mean they also had an
1:01:04
opportunity to first pick it but I do feel like yon has dropped just just a little a little Peg you know it's not
1:01:11
you know first pick territory I think that's fair but we've seen we've seen like bdd had a pretty
1:01:18
great performance on it we saw Zack himself have a pretty uh pretty good performance on it uh and by show make it
1:01:25
picking it it's a great pick but also denies it because of the Fearless forat Zea is looking for an angle here def
1:01:31
plus will back away is tank J so that poke basically non-existent uh
1:01:38
and show is still pushing he's he's fine I mean that's the thing they don't need this Dragon it's a singular ocean Dragon
1:01:44
Lucid might try and steal it but if they get a tier two that's a good trade hey they're even going to throw AAR ultimate
1:01:51
and the steal comes in why not they're not being zoned away they're winning the
1:01:56
push in Top Lane they're winning the teleport battle as well double teleport used by hle DK has both and they're just
1:02:05
controlling every single objective right now they're even pushing the mid lane yeah both TP used and still taking a ton
1:02:12
of damage on that mid lane Tower the pressure is just constant from D+ and
1:02:17
you know I think expectations was this would be a close series uh but it really feels like D+ have just had such an edge
1:02:24
so far in this game everything has been going in their favor and H kind of just on the back
1:02:30
foot consistently and the fact they lose that dragon and a decent amount of tower damage to those Tier Two Towers on top
1:02:37
of that you see the replay coming through so aiming ends up alting peanut
1:02:43
he does obviously Al block of damage but just sinking up the Beast a little bit there from D+ really well executed uh
1:02:50
it's something we've kind of seen T1 do a lot where they sink of damage onto a neutral objective with the Smite even
1:02:55
counting down uh to ensure that they can all H they can sort of you know obviously synchronize it and uh doing a
1:03:02
great job there to lock it in yeah I mean it's really important um and now you've got ocean soul Point as
1:03:09
well as DK we mentioned before it's not like super high value but against the Poke of the even the Jace who's barely
1:03:16
doing much the Ezra you can mitigate a lot of that the the azir and all of a sudden it just feels like it's
1:03:22
suffocating for H life Esports if you can't poke your way into areas we talked
1:03:27
about DK from ahead with this comp not only do they have the Malai for engage but he just throws a bunch of saplings
1:03:32
gets Vision there's nly traps everywhere you're ahead so you've got work coverage
1:03:38
and how do you really approach an objectives H life Esports at this point
1:03:43
it's difficult honestly I feel like the composition kind of factored around them having control and the enemy team having
1:03:49
to come into them but they just don't have the tools available to really get on top of like this this nly or this
1:03:55
virus is really hard to reach them and if you just constantly getting poked down it's going to be rough now D plus
1:04:00
do start up at a can I think this is probably the best case scenario for H to try and get back into the game is a
1:04:06
fight at this objective so D Plus have to be cautious uh and there's there this is
1:04:13
them walking away there's no reason to rush it you know there's nothing forcing them to take this objective now I think
1:04:19
starting up seeing what happens completely fine yeah but they're playing respectful of hle and they know that
1:04:25
throw at that objective maybe a Smite steel from peanut that is the best Avenue back in the game for H otherwise
1:04:32
D plus can just keep playing it out as it is and Zea that Tower is pretty low yeah and there's the AL going to
1:04:38
force the flash zeka gets away and you know Burns a couple alss from TK but now
1:04:44
you don't have flash as zeeka so a potential engage tool taken away potential safety and you know what they
1:04:50
do as well with their teleport lead is they see Jace moving up the river and they just back away and they get a
1:04:55
little bit of extra pressure for Su in the bottom Lane as Barrel little bit of an awkward spot here comes
1:05:02
Delight thinking about it yeah I mean they are moving towards the top side it feels a bit overused it kind of feels
1:05:09
like H saying look we're getting fored around the map G this TP Advantage we're just going to start it and force them to
1:05:15
come into us beinging some resources uh and de already I mean a
1:05:21
couple s still down here remember the Malai and there goes naly just flying as
1:05:27
Delight does his job the Smite should come in and there it is Peanut locks it down and now they've got reses to come
1:05:35
on in zeeka just going to you know go ahead try to throw his life away he does have Zas though there's the revive but
1:05:41
they're just looking for anything and anyone at this point they get barrel down they've already taken down shiu how
1:05:48
life Esports a very nice call I'm not sure if they're going to get anyone else you see Theon coming over the wall here
1:05:54
showmaker wants a bit more they would love to take out zus as Lucy gets that smiting gets a bit of a heal as
1:06:01
well showmaker still on the chase but it looks like they should get away but Aon into some more map control for halay he
1:06:08
SPS this game is still alive y great opportunity found beautiful ult from Delight able to disengage D Plus's
1:06:16
jungler it's a nice bit of Life coming in for H allows him to call close that gold lead a decent amount but I will say
1:06:22
uh not at the woods yet and yeah he into this but Delight you know if you don't connect this all onto Lucid maybe if
1:06:28
Lucid flashes it this could be completely different I think in the end try to go for the jump but doesn't find
1:06:34
it and now default are trying to get the damage down but they they're cautious cuz they know as soon as Smite comes in they're run in a bad place H they do a
1:06:41
pretty good job of clearing out the targets aely you know they're still very strong uh but that's the power of the
1:06:48
buff it doesn't matter if you trade up in terms of kills because the kills aren't
1:06:53
real they're like a little bit real slightly real yeah just a smidge the
1:06:59
thing is now we have the buff on Z and Delight so perhaps they will play a bit more aggressive leave the charge we have
1:07:05
a minute left Z does have TP so you can kind of think of it as like 6 V5 now if Z dies you can TP back in immediately
1:07:12
and D+ that they're fine just to kind of they set a vision but they're taking it slow uh not the worst case scenario if
1:07:19
this Dragon just go over but potentially look for a steel again they're looking for some poken fishing here right now
1:07:24
even going to commit to a mountai ultimate here for a bit of zoning nice as alt and now they're going to find Z
1:07:30
on the left side as you mentioned he's kind of just a free life though he's trying to go in and die and TP back into
1:07:36
the fight down he goes and he lives Big Al as well and now barrels just left to
1:07:42
the fishes down he goes and that is the ocean Drake as well for halalay Esports again still a very close game
1:07:50
between these two yep a lot of value there from Delights ults and Zas you know still that buff made the most of it
1:07:57
playing aggressively they're looking to try and pressure this Tower I think see
1:08:02
I mean he does I was going to say I think he got Ed a bit sooner oh Zea misses this is bad yeah that was not
1:08:08
great um he's going to get away at least but yeah kind of messing up his combo he
1:08:15
throws up a question mark for himself I think he knows what he did and that's
1:08:20
just fine because it doesn't really come back to bite them but maybe they could have gotten the turret if he didn't do
1:08:26
that and it's just so annoying cuz Z is rather bulky it's not easy to take him down and he kind of plays just like I'm
1:08:31
going to do maximum damage to everyone I can and just be a nuisance and he knows he's going to go down but he just
1:08:37
doesn't really care they have to respond to the threat it's not like they can just ignore him uh and then gets that
1:08:43
great ult which kind of leaves Barrel in uncomfortable position he twisted Advanced onto an Ezreal that has Arcane
1:08:50
shift as his team is retreating don't question Barrel so don't question Barrel it's his fault you wouldn't get it you
1:08:56
wouldn't get it but it was all calculated of course yeah and now that gold lead's closed a decent amount you can see from the graph so a lot closer
1:09:03
there got some core items come through uh got a black Cav from Z so three items
1:09:08
for him three items for Viper feeling a lot stronger uh and D+ haven't managed to secure that Soul yet I mean I don't
1:09:15
think ocean soul is a game Breaker by any means but that extra bit of power just isn't help but now they're looking
1:09:20
straight at the baron they want to stop the flip push from Z yeah I mean Taos does have TP so he
1:09:27
will be here they spot this Baron's only at half health I don't know if really commit to this okay they're just going
1:09:34
to commit to it I guess as the malkey ultimate looking it to Zone everybody away and it does exactly that Barrel as
1:09:40
well will sacrificed his life but showmaker able to trade it back and Al over the wall and there you go DK just
1:09:47
steals the baron under their noses a lot of confidence it feels you know H demonstrated this with adakan they're
1:09:53
like we're just going to start the buff we're going to make it win and D plus do a similar thing both times it was the supports create the space this time
1:10:00
Barrel's Al really denying access to the pit they get the baron we even see showmaker able to trade one for one on
1:10:06
the supports uh and able to get away with the buff this worked out really
1:10:11
well uh you can see this situation y comes through twist Advance peut can't get close H then showmaker make a great
1:10:19
C go in ult out disengages from the situation and now you have all on your
1:10:24
important members in especially I feel like with now at the point where this z h where Z on this Jace is a problem in
1:10:29
the side lane he's too bulky for sew to cut through he's got more golden him 2,000 gold up the only person ahead on
1:10:36
hle so having the baron against him definitely helps slow him down y even getting the zoom in on his
1:10:44
skin of course and he going to buy a tunneler
1:10:50
let see what he goes into as now we do have a bit of a push with that Baron going B
1:10:56
see I mean with with Zack if they give him time he'll be able to clear out these waves DK not overc committing to a push they don't have showmaker here and
1:11:04
it looks like they want to go for like a 131 with him in mid but a very cautious push at this
1:11:11
point in time really not overc committing see how sh handles zus sees
1:11:17
him and runs away yep that's one way to handle it oh early o from peanut there I
1:11:23
mean I guess maybe scared of some follow up SP some aiming but I like the Z value just hasn't really been seen that much
1:11:29
in this game it's like you press Al so you can avoid this this long range damage but you're not really doing much with that time H maral comes in force
1:11:37
him away aiming able to pick up that tier 2 bot Lane get a bit more gold uh they will have to respond to the top
1:11:45
side and we did see SE actually TP there so kind I felt like deep boss were maybe
1:11:50
hunting for a little bit more um not going to find it but they do get the Tier Two Towers I think happy with with
1:11:55
that and now looking towards that dragon in 40 seconds The Baron's going to fade off around the same time so I mean it's
1:12:03
they're not really going to get much from the pushing at this point but uh the extra stats would have been nice if you could uh have them line up with when
1:12:09
you're fighting for the dragon so not going to have those available
1:12:16
yeah yeah that's a finish on the rift maker there for zaka so big item pick up
1:12:22
right before this one does come through see aiming picked up a red potion so
1:12:29
kind of all in on this fight want to make the most of it uh seek arm guard uh as well for SE so a
1:12:36
lot of actives with value there for D+ in this one look at this brush I mean there is Ward in there for the side of H
1:12:44
life Esports so they will clear it out but it just gives you enough Vision to get some poking down they still have the
1:12:49
Malai ultimate but in 5 seconds they need a little bit of extra time and it starts early but it goes to rumble ocean
1:12:56
soul secured and The Equalizer is great hits Del light at least and does secure the kill Flash Forward from X this guy
1:13:03
is a Madman he has the Zas and he's burning down sea and that will be a free kill for them take a look at the rest of
1:13:10
the team as well Lucid desperately trying to Coral them up against the wall Viper doesn't have many places to go in
1:13:15
goes showmaker on the left Viper being coralled into that little Al Cove it is
1:13:21
just a straight up clean Ace to DK after the fight on ocean soul yeah there's a
1:13:27
little hiccup with the yakan in this game but for the most part D Plus have being in control being ahead able to
1:13:33
secure the ocean soul and the fight following and now will close out the game and this is what we've come to
1:13:38
expect from them they have started this ltk cup with a bang they just look so fantastic really
1:13:44
a team effort in this one showmaker does have a very cool uh KDA 5 no assist for
1:13:51
the Y of course as now will go the Nexus turrets and the lights can do absolutely
1:13:57
nothing flash on in aiming you know he he'd love to get some extra damage on the chart but that will just be a
1:14:03
relatively clean Victory here to the side of deep plus Kia and the fans are
1:14:08
loving it tonight yeah I think some limited options with the composition that H Le had in terms of dealing with
1:14:15
these uh you know with the virus and the N obviously got quite strong but to be honest it was more just how the game
1:14:20
panned out it felt like d plus had a better grasp of what they wanted to achieve from the lane stop felt like the execution was cleaner they managed to
1:14:27
secure some objectives with some great Smite secures from uh lucid and other
1:14:32
than the adakan which was like the moment of life for H the rest of the game felt even though there wasn't a
1:14:38
huge gold lead it always felt controlled from D+ yeah I really feel like whoever's
1:14:45
making the calls is probably Barrel um he's got everybody on the same page they've really just done a great job of
1:14:51
running straight into lck cup and just being extremely prepared and they've looked the most prepared out of any team
1:14:58
and the thing is as well H started the series on blue side so now next game probably going to pick blue side again
1:15:04
you know it's been favored massively but that means even if they win the next game deep plus get side selection in
1:15:09
that game three so a really big one here to take that first game for D plus it is
1:15:16
quite massive as D plus G looking like the favorites in this series we'll see if h a ESP Sports can do anything or
1:15:22
will it just be closed out we're going to take a break and have the space we'll be right back

1:21:56
hello everyone and welcome back to the space it is D+ Kia taking the early
1:22:01
Victory against Han life Esports in a great great match between the two top
1:22:06
teams in each group Deon here alongside chronicler and wolf that was a great
1:22:12
game here crony are DK good I I've fallen for this
1:22:17
trap so many times but at least in this game I think they played really well there was a lot of moments where they
1:22:24
could could have easily over invested into a fight something we've seen this team do countless times throughout the
1:22:29
past couple of years but they actually played really restrained play to our outs we didn't have lucid jumping into
1:22:36
multiple people and showmaker had a good yon game I'm just I I I don't know what
1:22:42
to make of this I mean he was dominating in sides he was crushing Z's ear we also aggressively yeah we also had a really
1:22:48
cool support Malachai that you and I wanted to talk about a little bit because we haven't really seen that that much this year um and you know Barrel
1:22:54
ends up winning on this pick usually you see Rumble paired with Malai in the jungle Roll But Malai still coming in
1:23:00
fitting as a support here allows you to dive the lane swapped Jace really well and sets up the rumble ultimates and
1:23:06
objective control so easily cuz you're dealing with a poppy on the other side which sometimes can create problems in terms of setting up those objectives but
1:23:12
Barrel is just like no I ult we have control first super easy to play out it's also you simultaneously set up
1:23:18
really good counter engage because the engage from H life is actually pretty lackluster if you look right like poppy is okay but not amazing
1:23:25
and then outside of that they had Zino jumping in who got targeted a bunch of times but it's it's not even like this
1:23:30
support maai isn't that crazy but it just further speaks to DK's willingness to just kind of do stuff right and I
1:23:37
think that's one of the biggest advantages that they've had so far even though they're level of play has been great it's just been willing to play
1:23:43
whatever and particularly in Fearless that's just going to throw up a lot of teams and it goes back to your original
1:23:48
question are D plus Kia good well they're dad entertaining because they
1:23:53
got two of the best chefs in all of the lck picking random things with uh
1:23:58
showmaker and Barrel and uh in this game it led to some early action some early Dives in uh this game number one as we
1:24:06
take a look at the highlights yeah this is another showcasing of like what you
1:24:11
can do with maai uh in terms of setting up Dives here and they put a ton of damage on Z as he tries to teleport back
1:24:18
in kind of a thing we've seen Z do in the past on T1 and the lane swap meta where tries to survive flashes out here
1:24:23
Barrel gets the jump on him is able to take him out even into the skies here and actually takes that first blood away
1:24:29
which is massive massive for feat of strength and Barrel ends up dying as well good that shinja picks up a kill
1:24:34
but it's well executed but that's not where it stops and unfortunately for Zas at this point isn't that tanky just yet
1:24:41
even with the spear from Lucid being just a little bit too late with the ultimate from aiming setting this up
1:24:46
they still have more than enough damage and it's the guaranteed lockdown that's there and the key thing is while that's
1:24:53
happening on the end of the map shiu finds himself in a similar predicament but he actually gets to trade a counter
1:25:00
kill peanut with the uh tur AG with the turret aggro and again just not quite
1:25:05
adjusted to how much damage this does now sets up DK for a really good mid game yeah I think if Delight actually
1:25:11
takes that aggro first and they play that out better this ends up working out way better for Hana life but peanut kind of botches it there engages first and on
1:25:18
the same page and then Peanut's like I'm holding the aggro doesn't judge the damage correctly so ends up being a
1:25:23
tradeback so the winning on on both sides of the map after getting that first blood as well just a fantastic early game here from D plus yeah again
1:25:29
great matchup in that Top Lane one of the best top laners in the world against one of the most hyped rookies that we've
1:25:35
had here in the lck in a very long time now highlight number two the combo
1:25:40
package here a Duo Deluxe if you will of Drake steals this is what I was talking
1:25:45
about you will not win the Smite fight if they played well against lefal varis and naly right Lucid is great at smites
1:25:52
just by virtue of being a great jungle thus far but particularly when you have that much burst it's possible and that
1:25:58
forces home Al life into a fight that they don't want to take because they need to deny the ocean soul and
1:26:04
unfortunately uh there was no vision there was traps there was saplings and I
1:26:09
think part of the compositional problems here for Han life or they have some forms of engage right they have a shinha can be decent engaged obviously they
1:26:15
have poy can knock people away and can be a tool to engage on and then the azir we all know what that's capable of right
1:26:21
but when you're behind in this maai the support maai adds so much because it buys you space it locks down these
1:26:26
Champions it prevents flanks it makes it really easy to just Turtle hunker down on an objective and say no and it's just
1:26:32
straight up a great composition here from D+ once again winning a draft so swimmingly I think they're our best
1:26:38
drafting team right now here in LSK cup and it's so cool because the team that in my opinion was the best at using
1:26:44
maokai to secure these objectives just get to the objective first which they can because they have been had and they have pryo and then just starting it
1:26:51
knowing that you have the ultimate was peanut peanut there was a reason why this man was basically undefeated on Malai because he was able to utilize the
1:26:59
uh Zone control of this Champion to just guarantee an objective and we also even though we didn't include it had this
1:27:04
with a baron happened the exact same thing where H life knew they had to approach but they just weren't able to
1:27:10
yeah okay so lots of love here on the side of D+ in terms of their play in terms of their drafting let's look on
1:27:16
the opposite sides of the lck reigning champions in Han life ESP Sports they
1:27:21
need to really tune it on up and play better the details on the Dives haven't been clean the macro hasn't been quite
1:27:28
there so we'll see if they're able to do that in game number two Han life Sports and D plus key let's head back on over
1:27:33
to the casters thank you spacers for that wonderful breakdown we are getting ready for game number two as we will have 10
1:27:42
more Champions band that we're not allowed to play we do do Fearless here at the lck cup you said Doo I did it's
1:27:51
also one of the players here that we have in uh our league part dnf yeah why did you
1:27:58
bring him up he's not playing yet he is playing today true a little bit getting
1:28:03
ahead of yourself so you know I I'm I'm looking forward to it it's all I wanted
1:28:09
to say life Esports select blue side again no surprise that they're going back to Blue uh being the highly
1:28:15
prioritized side in basically every situation so far in the LK cup but it
1:28:20
does mean that if they win this game it will be side selection over to D+ um let
1:28:27
see how the draft goes uh I feel like you know some of the things that have actually benefited de BL quite a bit is
1:28:33
the fact that showmaker took at yon So Not only was it a great pick for him but it also denies it away from H who have
1:28:40
two great un players and the bounds looking very similar which I feel like this will happen a fair bit in Fearless
1:28:48
where huh I feel like this will happen a fair bit inless where we see situation where
1:28:55
bands are quite similar because you know the pcks you had to deal with last time are gone they ban the Cante though I
1:29:01
think they're wondering maybe with the picks taken away with the fact that the Jace is gone that Z was going to leave the cassan open and pick it himself as a
1:29:07
first pick wouldn't surprise me but they ban it you can see H Le take some time to think out where their ban is and now
1:29:13
depos have a little bit of time to react so I think that's the reason they banned it second instead of waiting till third
1:29:18
uh and seeing if H banned it again because they wanted this third ban to be more flexible and they end up going for
1:29:24
the Zyra band as well but clist left open yeah I don't I don't know about
1:29:30
that bit of an interesting one um deciding to leave the CL open
1:29:37
fearing the Cante more they will look to deny the Rada um and they could end up going
1:29:43
something like Rada Ash you know that's plenty viable and Ash does well into CL
1:29:48
those permanent slows very effective but definitely for now denying
1:29:54
Rado that's the important thing to get out the way uh just the power of those two is a
1:29:59
Joo just so severe I think Lucid was thinking about the leas in but the Wukong is really The Shining Light of
1:30:07
the Jungle I'd say one of the more surprising ones we've seen rise up in
1:30:12
power just bit by bit Sani available it was available in the first round of bans
1:30:18
and picks last time but got banned in the second round so this time maybe not
1:30:24
going to go for it he doesn't have a chance to play sh jao Nico though the
1:30:30
choice first a very common Choice alongside of kalista um yeah hovering the Y you can't
1:30:38
pick that fais um would be nice you definitely c h the Nico makes a lot of
1:30:43
sense into the vard why we' really seen this pick shine because you know it does provide the engag throw ninch as the ult
1:30:50
layer but you have the range poke you know that you can use into rard it's a it's a difficult Lane for rard while
1:30:56
still providing the sort of synergy that um could do Aurora is also an
1:31:03
option uh we saw wukari piloted by KT great effect so that's also something
1:31:09
they could look to they could just leave mid for now uh potentially take an 8 carry if you want something like the ash
1:31:15
uh Al I'm not sure playing into cluster Nico might be a bit painful but they do
1:31:20
lock in the Ari so taking a page out of KZ and BD's book that combo we saw it uh
1:31:26
to great effect in that game two yesterday yesterday against T1 uh they kind of just run the rift so much team
1:31:33
fighting Power the reset potential of the arri the mobility of the Wukong really capable I just wanted to see syus
1:31:40
I mean there's like three Giga ults on the other side we saw ucal absolutely pop off by stealing the Nico ultimate
1:31:48
and getting five man ALS for himself but yeah it cannot be denied that the Synergy between these two picks in mid
1:31:55
jungle for DK are quite strong so they like to go against it and actually ban the silus so yeah I mean manada Al Ari
1:32:02
old lot of good value there they do ban away the ash uh the compare up with the Rada so still understanding the threat
1:32:09
there other picks that you could see pad with it you know Draven uh we've seen Draven rard pretty good into clist uh I
1:32:16
mean I guess you could we've seen him play MF you couldn't they replay that although I feel like doesn't sink as
1:32:22
wellard some of other things but team fighting Power uh we'll see what they end up leaning into Carly getting a
1:32:28
bound to B away some of these Melly picks that Z likes to lean into obviously would sink up with the uh
1:32:34
Sani yeah I'm not a big fan of the MF myself but uh it is going to be banned
1:32:42
away so both these teams fans of it and
1:32:47
thinking about it they're going to leave their ad carry pick for last so they select blind the Jacks expecting saves
1:32:54
to play it alongside of the Sani but there are a lot of things that are good into Jack still available so
1:33:00
blinding it makes it a bit less strong yeah I think just the value has with the
1:33:06
Sani is huge but also into the Sani you deny that stacking potential uh when you in a fight also good against kist con
1:33:13
Stack Up The Ren so securing that I think is completely fine the nck comes in we've definitely seen games where Nar
1:33:19
has run away with it into the Jacks but we've also seen games where you know wellplayed Jacks can repeatedly do
1:33:24
things like prop grasp on his mini form and and have some pressure uh also now pretty vulnerable in a swap situation we
1:33:32
you see the T coming through which I think makes sense when you look at the picks that uh D+ have a lot of dive
1:33:38
potential a lot of dashes to interrupt a lot of value from this and aiming
1:33:44
considering options I mean yeah there you go Koga
1:33:51
locked in for a [Music] this is what happens you know we don't
1:33:56
have Fearless maybe he just picks varis right this is a totally different situation so we get kgma rata glas the
1:34:05
idea you know it makes sense even if he does get burst down he's going to at least output a ton of damage especially
1:34:11
as the game and then even if he doesn't res he gets his passive yeah you know him not value after death but I do think
1:34:19
we've often seen kogo do well into Lanes like it was an old school H count to to
1:34:25
uh Kaiser uh as well into cler you know outranges her quite a bit she's trying to stack up Spears when you have your W
1:34:31
you just outrange and kind of melter so I can understand the thought process can see the value I still think the CL and
1:34:36
the NCO and combo will have pressure in the lane but what a magine is that D will try and go for a swap I think the
1:34:42
Jack will Fair better than the Nar and you avoid the the level one I think is a little bit problematic from the K Niko
1:34:49
um if they can get pressure there then they can really run away with it but I think once you get a few levels behind this Koga he should be pretty confident
1:34:55
in this Lane match up there's not a lot of times where I feel comfortable or good about a Koga pick in this day and
1:35:03
age as this guy is pressing the red button over and over
1:35:09
um we'll see how that works for him um but this is one of the times where I think it's actually good and we'll just
1:35:17
have to wait and see how it does do up against this kalista and niik Lane which has been having a lot of success
1:35:23
nowadays in the lck we see the comps we see the teams let's jump on of the rift
1:35:29
for game
1:35:35
[Music]
1:35:43
[Applause] two here we go game number two and we've
1:35:51
already got these three guys in box bottom Lane this is just like crean solo que um where every time it's just
1:35:58
everyone go bot level one and fight for the feet of strength um yeah we do see aiming going cleanse I
1:36:04
think makes a lot of sense but it does mean Viper and Delight have barrier heal so a bit more combat power I will say
1:36:11
another reason why uh the Cog mod does well into the clister is you kind of have similar item spikes if you're
1:36:17
playing a cre carry you need a bit you know you normally look like three four items but you follow a very similar
1:36:22
power curve as the kalister which does help out a lot you have a great mid game H it does look like H Le going for the
1:36:30
swap uh not sure if they were trying to read the swap from DK and match it but ultimately I think the swap does favor
1:36:39
D+ yeah swap is swapped and you hasn't seen anything yet
1:36:49
but he does ping the brush and he's about to see them now
1:36:54
and of course throws up an early Counter Strike he's still taking a decent amount of damage here getting zoned out of XP
1:37:01
most importantly yeah he's not going to get close to those fir uh first three melee
1:37:06
minions at least yep no XP at all received so far
1:37:12
uh Zell that's a lot of damage to take we
1:37:18
wouldn't get it we wouldn't we wouldn't understand yeah he's just on another level just a little bit of an overstep
1:37:23
uh definitely would make Dives a little more difficult and not having the maai compar to last time does make a bit more
1:37:28
painful H have this wave stacked up uh looking to hopefully get some more poke onto Su actually should be able to keep
1:37:36
these casters alive a little bit longer but once they get the next wave crashing put a lot of damage into the
1:37:46
Jacks so maker arei um he's going to actually hop as
1:37:51
he's getting rooted shiu still taking a lot of damage here in the 2V1 the heal
1:37:56
comes through Del light one turret shot but she just going to hop away and he does survive he's still got TP but not a
1:38:04
lot of XP gained from this wave I would say yeah not as much pressure coming out on the bot Lane so Z is kind of been
1:38:10
okay just picking all that farm up um you know I feel like Minar not the hardest to dive but you kind of need
1:38:17
your jungler there you know you don't have as much setup as you did last game when you had the maai trying to get some Auto trades and
1:38:23
I also think a problem is the kogmo obviously when you have your W up you're doing a lot of damage a lot of threat but outside of that you kind of whatever
1:38:29
whereas CL nio always threatening absolutely you can see you
1:38:36
nice patience nice restraint here uh to not go for the cannon Minion or any of
1:38:42
the minions really he's just sitting on one CS Z is a very similar spot on
1:38:47
three a bit more XP Lucid level four Wukong not
1:38:53
the best ganker but will they have the damage is really the question flash is away from the handshake and T gets away
1:38:59
with flying C but look at what's happening up here they do tank it see flashes away but a lot of turret shots
1:39:05
going into everyone they're going to try to go for the redive the Poke is coming in but she stays alive for now are they
1:39:12
too low I think they make the call we're a little bit too low we can't go for this again some expert play there from
1:39:18
seu just to mitigate the pressure keep the tower damage stacked up and everyone
1:39:23
was taking huge hits on H di mitigated pretty well I mean z also
1:39:29
doing a fantastic job in the bot Lane so both top laners surviving the respective
1:39:34
Dives I it's kind of insane um how they were able to do it very nice Flash from
1:39:40
zus and then Su saving his for the end and even Landing a big Counter Strike to
1:39:46
mitigate a lot of damage getting a stun on to two so close I think theight had just left range of the tower when the
1:39:52
stun hit otherwise he would have just died uh but it was very close um also by
1:39:59
the time that Viper got aggro one turret shot got him to half Health yeah if you took another he was just dead I mean
1:40:04
it's just insane how much damage these these turrets do now and if this had been last year H wouldn't have taken as
1:40:11
much damage and they would have just dropped the aggro and they would just gone for the dive again cuz they would have had enough HP and it would take
1:40:17
less time for to ramp up you can see how much more respect you have to pay and how much more outplay potential there
1:40:23
really is like we we've seen D still happen like absolutely they're still very possible but you know when both top
1:40:30
laners are playing well they it feels like they have a Fighting Chance yeah it really does I mean they
1:40:36
both played well they both survived and we've seen it before so no First Blood our top laners now going head-to-head
1:40:44
the ja versus n match up one we've seen so many times I think a lot of people
1:40:50
will be most curious about this as a very nice handshake gaming though looks like no W
1:40:56
available yeah wasn't quite there but you can see you know now there's a few levels behind them D+ is bot Lane
1:41:02
feeling a lot more confident in this 2v2 H just popping the W there for some
1:41:08
Lan priority actually committ the TP as well from showmaker showmaker hitting level six this is a huge Spike to have
1:41:14
for this grub fight uh and Lucid is committed to denying at least one of these from
1:41:21
peanut and me he's got his Smite available but he doesn't want to use it
1:41:26
on this one he's just going to secure the one peut gives the top of the morning pangu and is just walking away
1:41:32
you can see that H life Esports are going to drop down a wall though so they
1:41:37
did that and that was about it and now here comes DK as the handshake is good to light in a ton of trouble and First
1:41:44
Blood goes to Koga of all of the Champions on DK to get the money aiming
1:41:49
of course the gold King is looking to get it and there's the ch as well a nice
1:41:54
flash though saving it for the very very end was zeka they could just kill the
1:42:00
the Tia and get out here yeah they absolutely could just looking to run away actually going for a bit more the charm lands again after The Counter
1:42:06
Strike but CU not long for the world will have to pay for it here comes the mega going in but the Wukong Al is
1:42:14
available and Z just gets popped on the head by Lucid who takes him down Ro his
1:42:20
ankles there Lucid played it so well and what could just been you know that one kill on aeku with the dive they end up
1:42:26
getting more and D+ this is an even better start to this game the confidence
1:42:31
they had in this and the reason Luc is not smiling as you said they're so confident this fight with the Ari level
1:42:37
six they're like you know we want two grubs one is not enough to take away from this they look for this fight window this wall is a little bit
1:42:44
ambitious but also Zea now has basically no Mana he's just completely out the
1:42:49
split doesn't do much because show and Lucy can always get over the wall they look for who has no flash great pick up
1:42:55
great handshake from barrel and then they continue the dive with the reset CH has another round of cool Downs this
1:43:01
charm catching at the end and then Lucid flashes out doesn't want to take damage for free thought he could finish off Zea
1:43:06
but here in the redive fortunately the Jax does go down he's the one who ends up picking aggro up again doesn't have
1:43:13
Flash but this from Lucid Z goes in goes for the ult completely Jes him stalls
1:43:20
him out with the ult comes back in Dodges everything what a
1:43:25
play yeah I mean you that's one of those moments I didn't hear what he said
1:43:34
but talking about I think dodging something so that would make sense but that is just a guess for me don't take
1:43:41
my word for it um yeah I mean it it was just excellent stuff and you know Lucid
1:43:48
when he first came in he was impressing from time to time now he's kind of just impressing all the time
1:43:53
this is the Lucid we expected from Challenger league and they got another one of these guys from Challenger league
1:43:59
with ch so I feel like you know a lot of players come up I mean they are fantastic but like a lot of players come
1:44:05
up from challenges and they might look good you know they might be strong maybe they have a constant time in the lck but
1:44:10
it just feels like now Lucid is just at the top you know competing with the top jungl in the lead and and doing it so
1:44:16
well and plays like that just it kind of makes you forget how recently he joined the lck
1:44:23
yeah I mean and it's his birthday re uh soon you know he's playing extra extra well
1:44:31
yeah it's uh 3 days until his birthday but this closest match to it so
1:44:36
celebrating his birthday today no and the thing is D+ if they take down h i
1:44:43
mean like this this was the opponent where if anyone was going to stop them going 5 and0 it would have been
1:44:49
hle and right now it's looking like the they're not going to be able to stop them it just feels like yeah they're on
1:44:56
another level right now the only other team that DK has left is of course the final boss bro oh never mind then that
1:45:03
is that's a real challenge you know it's easy you know understandable sometimes
1:45:09
to make the mistake to forget but uh yeah can't forget about bro uh bro versus DK that's going to be
1:45:16
next uh Saturday I believe I guess maybe Deus just got lucky not playing against bro yet
1:45:24
might be an awkward timing too you know where if Bros stomped them like right before playoffs and then they're like oh
1:45:31
we're not as confident as we were when we were winning might get uncomfortable for
1:45:37
DK we'll see we'll see but still got a series to finish out ahead of them here uh peut trying to start up these grubs
1:45:44
but Lucid is just on him refusing to give over anything they've already picked up that
1:45:49
Dragon pick up one of these grubs peanut does have his Smite though getting one grub would stall out the feat of
1:45:56
strength but it just feels like the members of D plus are moving in the Ari is there again it's
1:46:02
risky Smite yeah he has Smite yeah denies the contribution towards the of
1:46:07
strength uh and it looks like D+ not even particularly interested after that point like okay we couldn't
1:46:14
get the strength contribution go back to farming you can have the other grub when not bothered oh bot Lane bit of damage
1:46:22
coming in as well but not looking to dive any turrets against a Jax who
1:46:27
probably had Counter Strike Z's far up the lane but oh he needs to get out now
1:46:33
okay well he he leaves vision and D Plus's bot Lane basically figure he's backed off obviously we know with
1:46:40
spectator view that if they'd gone down they might be to catch him out but it was an awkward timing when you're just about to get exhausted uh very
1:46:46
vulnerable P 20 is able to escape TP back in looking for some more pressure so you really wanted to get all of the
1:46:54
melee minions at least and he does and I feel like a lot of H's game plan or even
1:47:00
their success so far has kind of been leveraging Z as like a split push threat you know we saw that priority on the
1:47:05
Jace last game and he was the one the only one with the gold lead really leaving him alone in the Sid Lane we've
1:47:11
kind of seen that before in some of the earli series so that might be the Avenue in this one
1:47:16
but it's just so difficult uh because I mean a Jax can kind of just clear the
1:47:22
wave and Counter Strike isn't the it's not like you're going to be able to dive him or anything uh later in the game and
1:47:28
you have this CL Nico which hasn't really popped off uh at the point of the game where they're supposed to be strong
1:47:34
so little bit worrying so far but definitely still opportunities yeah here comes Lucid DEA
1:47:41
just has no idea but oh he gets stunned on the back Rock just the like the final
1:47:46
one the beginning one that the tiia throws out so when you get a pebble in your shoe you know yeah take take sh get
1:47:54
of it oh uh well yeah flashing into the Sani unfortunate timing here for C he is
1:48:00
extremely dead not much he could do about that except uh try to respect the
1:48:06
lack of vision I suppose feeling his own hype a little bit there uh ends up thinking he had an angle onto Z in the
1:48:12
Minar and gets punished for immediately showmaker now paired up with Barrel yeah
1:48:18
uh you know part of the reason why we don't get as much action in the lck as Legion is because players who have been
1:48:25
around for a while will respect the lack of vision and they just won't go for that kind of play and so they just sit
1:48:30
back and F unlike in challenges where it's just blood for the blood God
1:48:35
constantly yeah but also like the jungler is not there cuz he's fighting in the Top Lane for some reason like
1:48:40
what you mean for some reason it's because they kill their opponents yeah true I guess yeah I remember it was some
1:48:46
quote it was someone asked I can't remember which team it was but they asked some some LPL players some LPL team like oh uh um you know why' you
1:48:53
always why' you look for these fights why you always so aggressive It's like because we think we can win it's that
1:48:59
simple we think what are you fighting for because we can win uh that's what see we went for here unfortunately H he
1:49:06
didn't win in this yeah I mean if it was one V one
1:49:11
sure you know go for it maybe you get the kill but you don't have any Vision no Wards Sani could be there and if he
1:49:18
could be there and he is there you always lose so you don't take that risk um so bit of a maybe next time he won't
1:49:26
be there so he goes for it again well hey players do that as well where they just act like madmad and you're like
1:49:32
well always playing like the junglers here Delight bit of awkward damage going in
1:49:38
but no over committal from Lucid that Wukong is doing a lot of damage already I mean they had the CL ult so Delight
1:49:44
was never dying didn't be in Flash didn't be in heal but uh does take him off the map and dragon spawning up now
1:49:50
and it's ocean cloud as long as it isn't chemtech D+ are
1:49:56
guaranteed a strong Soul have we had a chemtech soul yet yes we did uh when I
1:50:02
was last casting with Max oh that makes sense uh Z is in a bit of trouble he does have mear about to pop and there it
1:50:09
is the wallup comes down the range not enough so Lua just going to flash in and
1:50:15
Bop him on the head that's a second Bop on the head Kill from the Wukong and his ult just came up I feel like one of the
1:50:21
things is n ult such a low cool down you can of just Sho the trading so frequently rare window where it wasn't
1:50:27
available and it was seconds away you can see it's now available for him so D Plus Great capitalization you can see
1:50:32
earlier in the game they were looking for Windows to punish Z didn't find it when aan and Barrel were looking to move down but now they did now they're
1:50:39
looking for this dragon and peut trying to find a steel oh well the Wall's going to come in and kind of cor them up
1:50:44
against it but the light hits nothing and is just rooted up a lot of damage though on this front line lucid and
1:50:51
Barrel are going to go down so hav P Sports they get a big chunk of Gold On The Backs side that they shut down Lucid
1:50:57
as well and a lot of that gold did go over to Zea so not half bad such such a chaotic passage of play I mean I want to
1:51:04
see the replay cuz there's just some very very funny things that came out of that ultimately D plus to get the Dragon
1:51:09
Mountain Soul definitely going to be happy with uh particularly when you're playing into something like a clister it's going to feel pretty rough later on
1:51:16
cutting through that uh Zea looking to continue some pressure here peut is on standby ja not the EAS just Target dive
1:51:25
and Barrel is running down they got to make it quick I mean there is a chance but
1:51:32
they're not going to go for it just yet The Counter Strike though does come out bit of extra damage coming in and
1:51:37
there's the turret does go over to H life Esports they already had a turret
1:51:42
up in Top Lane so it's going to add a second one uh second one to their list this
1:51:50
that first play where Z did end up going down um not sure that they need both the flashes or something I will say but
1:51:58
aiming is a gold King he wants the gold forun he doesn't get it um but yeah
1:52:05
a little bit of aning there and then here so Delight has an angle for a big ult but the chance from showmaker is
1:52:11
massive denying it but then Viper pulls Delight in but he gets Ed by the Rada
1:52:17
but since the light is inside him he can only Auto the enemy team so he actually starts pumping down damage out D Plus
1:52:23
have to BL back away and end up losing two for it so you know great charm by showmaker Barrel maybe not getting the
1:52:30
intended effect out of that one yeah a lot of little weird things in
1:52:35
there Delight throws himself into the two front guys as everybody's running away from DK and just locks them down to
1:52:41
make sure they get the kill so now you've got this Rift tur as well does feel like life Esports are pulling into
1:52:48
lead bit by bit we see how these Dragon fights do go but you've got a lot of uh
1:52:53
extra money on your kalista on your tia the Nar as well is ahead and I think
1:53:00
that's a big thing is like the CL of is still very strong in the mid game oh Cheeky from Lucid but uh as I was saying
1:53:06
cler value is still very strong the Zea gets a lot of value in these fights and these fights are going to feel very momentum based because if D+ get a pick
1:53:12
you know they have the Ariel resets they have the rard so it's it's hard to sort of turn it around once there's momentum
1:53:18
you also get in the reset if someone goes down they can come back alive but if you don't get that if H are the ones
1:53:25
initiating uh definitely going to feel very different so I expect the fights to be a bit more Stompy than we've seen in
1:53:31
uh in the last game yeah certainly does uh feel like that'll be the way it goes
1:53:38
for now just a bit of farming our favorite thing to do here at the lck 2
1:53:43
minutes until the mountain Drake does spawn a minute 20 till adakan as
1:53:48
well uh is on the top side so I feel
1:53:54
like you know when we talk about it being top of bots side I feel like in this situation if it's Bots side it's next to Dragon it makes Dragon really
1:54:00
scary because if you lose that dragon fight you just lose out of can of the after with the be on the top side a bit
1:54:05
safer but it also makes it very hard to play for Dragon once Baron spawns as well cuz you're so locked to that top
1:54:11
side of the map uh Harold comes in I you do have the uh Ral glass just
1:54:18
kind of doing nothing baral throut his Al hit nobody and then died and Sani Al
1:54:24
of course utilized to make it possible but the positioning was not the greatest so barl just kind of doing Barrel
1:54:31
things low roll this time I like the T just making it so hard you really need
1:54:36
to find flank angles into this composition and Barrel yeah I mean I feel like so many rados are used to
1:54:42
playing with the clist where you're like hey I'm out a position grab me and A's
1:54:47
like what I'm I don't do that just grabs his arm there
1:54:54
what do you mean I mean this fight is just you know
1:55:00
you're getting walled off there a rift tald coming in you see bar throws out the alt just his Zone and then he's
1:55:07
like here take B two yeah bit over aggressive I think the tower was so low
1:55:12
just stepped up too far and peut quick to punish m one going down pretty nice for
1:55:17
H and you can see now Focus really moving over towards his top side even even if the dragon ends up being a
1:55:23
priority they need Vision here you do not want to trade this Dragon for the attam buff obviously D+ it put them one
1:55:29
away from Soul but you could lose so much off the back of that attam buff that it just it wouldn't even be
1:55:37
worth yeah I mean thing about their composition with aan I mean you have so many different ways to just dive on in
1:55:44
even the Tia could just straight up wall into your team so um alongside of
1:55:51
everybody else you throw a go in don't even need to consider playing defensively from there so H life Esports
1:55:59
certainly want to get this objective for now it's only Z just kind of just standing next to him this might be the
1:56:05
mistake though if D+ so it was a heavy lean Bots Side by hle but it looks like
1:56:10
they got it down in time this is one of the risks is that you put so many members down bot Lane for the dragon it
1:56:16
did mean that they were vulnerable on the top side but it also meant they did the dragon so quickly and now they're
1:56:21
able to turn towards the top side and protect there so H make a Gambit that D+ AR going be ready AR going to start at
1:56:28
in time and they were right they were correct so they get the dragon and now they're back in time to protect not only the top ler but the buff as well so
1:56:35
great moves from them great Confidence from hle here you see Peanut's positioning aiming going to find him I
1:56:42
thought he was going a face check for a second yeah unfortunate timing for peanut but you got to be careful about overextending even as saidani yeah you
1:56:49
can't sit in that brush forever also at some point you have to leave now they look to be setting up the atakan they do
1:56:56
have a cler so a lot of secure potential and you can see the damage already significant Z I mean they must know with
1:57:02
Zea doing that that they've started it but can they even get there in time Lucid is coming me there's a wall in
1:57:07
their face and it's just got to be a steal but it's not it's kalista so difficult to steal against that as you
1:57:13
mentioned Here Comes H life Esports barreling Through the Jungle desperately trying to go for a fight but DK at least
1:57:20
able to go for the dissing engage still very comfortable spot for hle they got the first dragon uh first mountain
1:57:27
dragon they have now the varous Aon buff they have the Feast of strength and uh they can essentially do
1:57:35
whatever they want they've still got a lot of cool Downs as well consider how rough the St this game was they've really bounced back massively now don't
1:57:41
have a huge wave to work with but D plus are just unwilling to engage them and for good reason so they lose that T2
1:57:48
Tower Top Lane can uh defend mid from Z can see
1:57:53
the pings coming out you know they put one member mid the rest of the team put pressure on the top Lane they can just
1:57:58
flip that on the other side of the map and put that pressure on that bot Lane tier two and look to try and secure that get
1:58:05
a big influx of gold 4,000 gold ahead now you look where a lot of it is you know it's kind of spread out between the
1:58:11
carries jungle about even Sports about even but th000 gold lead 280 carries 750
1:58:17
mid 2,000 in the Top Lane it's exactly where you want it to be yeah you're feeling very good and you know we were
1:58:24
all pretty excited for the Koga pick just because of something new you know it's Fearless oh this might work you
1:58:30
know with the rata glass but if if Barrel keeps dying and getting out of position then it really does take a lot
1:58:36
of power away from the kogal you need your rata glass to be alive in order to cast her abilities so that your cogal
1:58:43
gets that extra value it's definitely one of the reasons why they picked Koga in the first place you know R's just not
1:58:49
that amazing at engaging um are Al so slow sometimes you see with cl where they throw the Rada in and then the ult
1:58:56
but uh ultimately into this T I think these Dash Champions is struggling to close the gap so they're kind of relying
1:59:02
on Barrel to engage it's kind of falling flat and we see hle you know they flip to the other side Z is in mid lane
1:59:08
applying pressure the rest of the team get this tier two just textbook exactly how you want to play it back that's two of those not just the fact it's the Tier
1:59:14
Two Towers but the extra gold being in the outer Lanes really just helping to
1:59:20
boost this gold lead even more now it's 20 seconds until the buff will fade and isn't that crazy Brandon they didn't
1:59:27
just run it down isn't that so R it's so rare I
1:59:32
thought you had to die when you had the attam buff but apparently H will just take valuable structures and choose to
1:59:40
not die that's that's wow yeah insane it almost felt like a baron buff you know
1:59:46
like where they're pushing and there's just so much pressure in the lanes that the losing team kind of just lets them
1:59:51
push and doesn't really try to fight them um and they don't overextend because
1:59:57
they don't have a revive with Baron buff yeah I think def played it correctly by giving them space but H you know I feel
2:00:03
like some of our other teams would have just Tower dived at that point and all died and not gotten the towers uh but
2:00:09
now the play comes around to this Baron that has just spawned fighting for the red buff here
2:00:15
uh delay goes in gets a decent Al but it's not amazing and the charm is huge
2:00:20
again showmaker going pretty big on this Ari Z just pressuring the tower and you
2:00:26
know the out of towers good play from H but I feel like D+ has missed a trick letting this T mid go down peut a little
2:00:33
bit out of position but is going to force the flash out of Shu has his team behind him at least and can always Dash
2:00:40
over the wall so nicely done there H sports with their kalista will they just start the baron there's no vision here
2:00:45
at all for D plus Kia I feel like it's just so clear that these are two of our
2:00:51
strongest teams when both game one and two I mean you know this game too D+ had the early lead but once H got control it
2:00:58
has been that controlled similar to how D plus handled game one it's measured
2:01:04
and the teams know you know when they wi in position exactly how to keep pushing those advantages without making mistakes
2:01:10
and D+ right now are hunting for any mistake from H to punish Z oh they all Dodge it it kind of
2:01:18
spread around it that was pretty cool but nice positioning really does
2:01:23
highlight so much damage yeah really does highlight that there's just no vision here for DK and they're desperate aiming alone has to flash he was just
2:01:30
walking down mid lane for some reason it's just so hard for them to approach you know Z is throwing these Boulders
2:01:35
and you can't engage and he just throws down the unravel Earth and you're completely cuffed So Def get forced away
2:01:41
another mountain dragon over the hle more defensive stats you can see as well
2:01:47
when you look at itemization a lot of M being picked up by hat
2:01:52
it really feels like everyone's going to start to get bulky and bulky it and especially if they end up I mean
2:01:57
Mountain souls are time away but the tankier they get the harder it gets to kill those initial targets and bear in
2:02:03
mind the initial targets are probably going to be like peanut Z or delight and Delight hard to kill because of the kist
2:02:08
AL but if peanut and Z get too tanky just you're not going to get the resets you know you're not going to be able to turn things
2:02:15
around it's going to make your comp feel a little flat Terminus coming through as
2:02:20
well from Viper I feel like you could honestly go like Jack show after that uh not not just cuz of the mountains but it
2:02:27
would sync up well with that but the extra ST the extra resist you get from Terminus really just allowed you to kind
2:02:33
of play in their face really does uh extend the life span of a pick like kalista where sometimes
2:02:41
you know feels low range if the game goes too long can sometimes not have a huge impact but yeah it's kind of like
2:02:47
Bruiser kalista build it just makes it uncomfortable for pi as well cuz Zea has LeAndre and Archangels he's quite
2:02:54
actually bulky for a mage if Viper becomes quite bulky and then Delight you have the safety net the CL all it's like
2:03:00
who are you picking uh on this team there it is the flash on in Viper in a bit of trouble but Delight is zoning
2:03:06
excellently and peanut is going to land that Al onto uh the Wukong but Zea has
2:03:11
to flash away tons of damage coming out from aiming but it doesn't seem to be enough nice R A Al though trying to turn it around trying to give them some space
2:03:18
Zu is pushed into zeka and given kill this ja now has an angle he's going in
2:03:26
he's looking but he's not going to hit it as they do push away DK not out of the game just yet they don't get the
2:03:32
initial pick on viper but they' managed to find some kills get some pressure back just as the game f like it was
2:03:37
leaving that grasp they find an angle now H you're not going toble to defend this Tower see playing aggressive there
2:03:43
but we'll back away rest of the team's like whoa whoa whoa hold on Buddy like we're running away we don't do that here
2:03:48
okay it's not challenges you need to chill out a little bit but now actually Lucid is just spawning now they can head
2:03:53
over to Baron and potentially get some Ren uh Ren stacked up on it if they want to but looks like not making the push to
2:04:01
commit to it we'll see the replay Lucid finds an angle I think importantly zacha had just moved away wasn't there to
2:04:08
provide heal the light gets a great UL to buy time but unfortunately I think Viper CED away wasn't in range to pull
2:04:15
him in so he does just go down this UL Barrel massive value in sh in Saving
2:04:20
showmaker and then this this uh jump from the Jacks you can see that Zea
2:04:26
thought that they had him locked down thought he was going to be able to full combo him but just jumps over the knockback straight into the Tia so good
2:04:34
play from D plus not ready to give up yet yeah I mean one thing to be said we
2:04:39
we've had so many metas League's been around for a very long time but and so is Koga right there's been metas where
2:04:45
Koga was king and you just had a giant front line and he just sat back and did a bajillion damage and you had
2:04:51
enchanters and tanks and stuff and protect the Koga comps were a thing we haven't really seen that for a long time
2:04:56
if this game goes and he's got like six items and you're not engaging perfectly and you're not taking out aiming you
2:05:03
might just lose so h b Sports have to be incredibly careful about how they approach every single objective right
2:05:09
now that's the thing he's so hard to itemize against you know he's got the blade R king but also does so much magic
2:05:15
damage um really makes it difficult for the front line and normally when you're playing these tankier front liners
2:05:20
eventually get to the point where like you know you feel confident in your bulkiness if aiming just starts pumping
2:05:27
damage into you you'll go down there there's no ifs and buts about it so definitely have to be cautious about
2:05:34
that level 16 hit there for Z I think another Factor as well is even though HD
2:05:39
control they're not that far in ahead compared to D Plus in terms of experience often like securing a baron
2:05:46
can make a big difference yeah uh but obviously with that not going down yet they've kept it closer now
2:05:52
they see the light do some scouting with cogm more don't want to get caught una awes
2:05:58
yeah it's a good thing about the Koga as well but you got to be careful about running out of Mana you need to make sure you have enough for your W to keep
2:06:04
it uh alive so you're actually pumping out damage but if you don't have Vision you have to check the brushes Lucid can
2:06:12
be decent at it just because he can clone away from a lot of CC but you got to be quick on the trigger on that one as well yeah stacking Mana cost and the
2:06:19
AL can really catch up quickly that Ward huge value there now they aren't starting the baron and but there's full
2:06:26
information from D plus they know exactly what HD looking for trying to bait them in well there's a wall coming down
2:06:32
trying to get aiming he doesn't have Flash but it's just Z who gets chared and dies instead and aiming is totally
2:06:39
safe no followup nothing just Zea going in and dying I love The Confidence from
2:06:45
showmaker flashes in he's like I'm making the pi finds an angle on Zach's burn all his cool Downs are starting up
2:06:52
mean available this could be dangerous yeah they're taking a bajillion damage from the baron as well and okay charm
2:07:00
comes in again see you just going to bpop the n on the head rata glass Al actually does a good job of zoning great
2:07:06
zoning alt as everybody is getting away here peanut has to flash they're looking for more though the charm is going to
2:07:12
land again man showmaker is just incredible on this pick as the knock up on Aus they want to take him down aiming
2:07:19
going 1 V one versus a kalista going to keep keep him alive but Barrel will trade his life with the Nar uh the
2:07:25
tower's still there so perhaps not you know to get away but can they get him
2:07:30
really oh the W from showaker the flash on in from Lucid gets the job done so
2:07:36
many low health bar so many people out of position ier is just dead here
2:07:41
unfortunately wait can he get execute this might be it no well close enough close enough
2:07:47
close enough okay you didn't give the kill to Zea or Viper you'll take that uh it is Pina who gets the kill fortunately
2:07:54
showmaker has TP so he is off the map for a while but just have that TP get him we see the replay and The Confidence from showmaker the charm flash to find
2:08:01
Zea saves his ad carry and just flips the pick on its head beautiful play here
2:08:06
it does look scary aiming and Barrel get low but this Slam in from Z backfires
2:08:12
with the stun and then that ult from Barrel it doesn't hit anyone but it splits the fight completely yeah this is
2:08:18
where it gets a little bit messy from it's a great charm from showmaker he has
2:08:23
really been on point with Zari uh I think killing Z completely fine it's a
2:08:30
little bit goofy after that you know they're uh flashing after the CL I think they forgot the tower was there um and
2:08:37
then peanut without the kogmo hitting him is pretty tanky um and they do find
2:08:42
him it's a decent amount of gold for Lucid but uh just very chaotic at the end of the day and now H they're on the
2:08:48
map sooner they're able to pick up this dragon show did have TP but they opted not to use it I think him not being on
2:08:54
the map me they were cautious about approaching and that's three Mountain dragons for H Lee one away from Soul but
2:09:00
also in terms of just the stat the dragon gives it's pretty significant uh especially as Viper has gotten that Jack
2:09:06
show now this is a bulky 8 carry it is kind of crazy you know you got a too with 156 armor yeah um I mean
2:09:16
everyone is I mean apart from Delight really everyone is quite bulky and Delight has like he has celestial
2:09:21
position he's a seeker's arm guard he has the kist ult but everyone else just has a lot of raw defensive stats
2:09:28
um not the greatest feeling to have playing up against that it really might
2:09:33
just come down to okay we've got a lot of burst damage but we can't really burst through many targets so aiming go
2:09:40
kill or we might just lose the thing is they need the momentum for like the resets and stuff showmaker so when you
2:09:46
don't have a good Target a beer is painful now they have started this up uh the do have teleport in the Jack so can
2:09:53
get there to respond but you want to force him up the baron ear cuz if it comes down to a 50/50 there's a cl to
2:09:59
that so it's not a 50/50 it towards them and that's what how life Esports is playing towards they're like yeah you want to flip go ahead let's try it's not
2:10:06
a real flip we got a little play in mid zus trying to hop away he's actually doing a ton of damage here comes the
2:10:12
wall so makeer awkward spot and dble go see there's the knock of an elusion he doesn't do much Z goes down yes but it's
2:10:19
h life Esports up a man aiming still alive though so trying to make a potential play knockup not going to come
2:10:26
in for zeeka but they're looking at the baron still up a player let's see if they can
2:10:32
get it going to be hard for D plus to try and contest is Ze is looking for pick there he got slowed flash traded
2:10:40
and the sticks are in the baron delight's got an angle on the left they don't quite see him aiming he's showing
2:10:46
himself on the left and that's an Eco he gets flashed on he flashes away though he gets away he gets SP but it's just
2:10:53
not maybe enough he's trying to get the reset it's not going to happen Viper just has the damage and how will I
2:11:00
Esports win the fight and will take down this Baron which is doing a million
2:11:05
damage but it doesn't matter they will have up Y for the
2:11:11
respawn oh oh it was ear yeah was they got it they got it they got it they got it they got it okay it looked like it
2:11:17
was ear I was looking at the the thing on the top left yeah yeah no okay that they got it right they got it right um
2:11:23
yeah hectic fight and you Oh my he just picked up a g as well the CL we got of see uh See we're trying to bait in Z
2:11:30
here but Z just so much damage at this point of the game uh we see rest of the
2:11:37
team focused down on Lucid he gets kicked apart Z does unfortunely go down before Mega FRS uh and Viper doesn't really kill the
2:11:44
light funly enough but now H like look they don't have Arial we have a CL we can set up on this but the light a
2:11:50
beautiful flank angle here finds both the carries and yes aiming flashes out
2:11:56
but he can't get the reset Viper two tankies just standing in his face yeah it shows the value of the bulkiness he
2:12:03
has in his build and he just killed Delight with his passive but delight's job was done
2:12:09
there yeah Delight knows what it's like to be in that position and and sometimes all it takes is one big ult you know you
2:12:15
can have kind of a mediocre game not really popping off in a big way but you hit a big al at the right time aing and
2:12:22
you can be the hero and it did feel like you know there was a potential if aiming and showmaker
2:12:27
had room to maybe do something in that pip but not when Delight hits that Al here comes a wall and they're up against
2:12:35
it there goes Delight in once again Lucid dies mid Dash as showmaker and
2:12:40
there we finally have the big Nar Al into the wall the Coga goes down and this game is done and dusted Hite B
2:12:49
Sports should be able to take it down here as they will as five members be able to
2:12:54
push into the DK base yeah oh I can find the combo a showmaker I mean without ult you can't
2:13:01
really do much and it just Clos in the game out series
2:13:06
equalized oh he he did get second series equalized and ultimately you know H
2:13:12
little bit of a a rough start start of that game and yes in the mid game we did see D plus fight back but for the most
2:13:19
part they just pushed the lead forwards found control bounced back when it struggled and it's just blow for blow
2:13:25
between these two teams definitely showing what the top of the LC is right now uh and now looking towards a game
2:13:31
three where D Plus have that side Advantage but just yeah I I I feel like we're getting a treat today with this
2:13:38
series we absolutely are I was scared that DK were just going to come in with another two Z but halalay P Sports
2:13:44
showing some life here in the second game you know the kalista left available first picked by Viper got huge value
2:13:51
especially when he was stacking up all of those Mountain Dres yeah and even with like the cogo and the ronard denial
2:13:57
counter like aan got a lot of damage done it's not to say like the pick was bad but you know even late in the game
2:14:02
Viper just kind of did what he could we've seen this Wukong AI work before we even saw some signs Alik from it in this
2:14:09
game but H was just so bulky it was four tanks and a Nico with like two different
2:14:15
ways of being unkillable with the Zas and the kalist AL so I think eventually just D Plus just couldn't cut through uh
2:14:23
what H had and I just I'm so glad this is a three gamer cuz I wanted this to be a close match and H Le making sure is it
2:14:31
absolutely is DK probably going to be moving over to blue side we'll see how that goes for The Fearless draft of game
2:14:37
three but first guys a break we'll be right back

2:21:44
[Music]
2:22:04
we're all tied up back here in LW Park as the lck Champs battle back and tie D+
2:22:12
Kia as it is one to one Hana life doing good work in game number two Deon alongside Chronicle and wolf and Hana
2:22:20
life started off slow with this one the early First Blood going over to kgma and
2:22:25
then after that they took control of the game and D+ were on the back foot the whole time yeah a bit of a vintage
2:22:31
Barrel unfortunately but not the good vintage Barrel on this one and Shu also really showing that he is still kind of
2:22:38
coming into his own I think he had a really rough game and even though the trio of showmaker lucid and a tried
2:22:44
their best they couldn't couldn't pull a through I think the draft um was fine we're not going to talk about it in too
2:22:49
much detail it it wasn't the most strong D+ draft we've ever seen But the clear game plan for D+ was once again just
2:22:55
punishing sides early set up Dives with showmakers Ari which he played incredibly well through the early game
2:23:01
but team fighting later on became a big problem Ox mentioned it already on the cast like there's just too many tanky
2:23:06
members when you fall behind and they end up getting three Mountain Drakes you're just not breaking through that Mr
2:23:12
yeah again multiple chefs on this D+ roster this time it was aiming on the cogma pulling out something different
2:23:18
didn't quite pan out let's take a look at the High lights here highlight one uh this is Z's getting thrown behind but
2:23:24
then this is where the tempo falls off for D+ yeah it's really interesting because I think Zas had a lot of really
2:23:31
bad moments in this game but he also got two that kind of won them the game because even though they give him up
2:23:38
here what is much more important is that a lot of resources are invested and they don't get the drag or even though they
2:23:44
do get the dragon the fight win that comes through here is what kind of gets homo life back in the game because
2:23:49
before this DK was setting up for the early game like they were in game number one and this is one of Zea's better
2:23:54
plays uh on the TOA with the Weaver wall because D plus is kind of emo for these dragons have been snap it get out you
2:24:01
know and he was able to put his wall down as they engage through there preventing their Retreat so it was really clean TOA play from him he had
2:24:06
the right position and they knew what tools they had to actually lock D+ in place there and punish uh the fact that
2:24:12
a lot of resources were used killing Z moments before yep highlight number two here this is where it goes from Drake to
2:24:18
next objective next objective and this is where Han life was rolling not a lot of ances here for D+ as we take a look
2:24:23
at it uh one more time so this dragon is fine right like this gets taken this is the first dragon you don't get Soul
2:24:29
point but it's not the end of the world I just really want to show as soon as DK lost control in this
2:24:35
game I want you to think of how do they actually approach because tiia basically
2:24:40
counters every form of engage that they have so we get the engage ranada attempts from Barrel which as we're
2:24:46
about to find out just doesn't really work and I it hwa just show that if they can play their own game if they can kind
2:24:52
of go back to the penut go macro DK don't really get a lot of angles back in I mean flashing into melee range on Ari
2:24:58
was kind of their engage for the early game right um but obviously in a setup like this where you don't have that much
2:25:03
Vision there there's a ward as you can see there it's really hard to actually break through and H life Esports with
2:25:09
this tanky kalista that's so difficult to kill it's hard to actually lock anybody down like to kill Viper takes
2:25:15
way too many resources you still have to deal with zeka's damage you still have to deal with the Sani you put all your resources into killing sedani or trying
2:25:22
to kill a mega Nar then you get ripped apart by the kalista and once H Sports had control of the game they just
2:25:27
weren't going to let it go uh zeka did have the one moment where he jumped into free people and they lost the fight
2:25:33
which actually made the game Lost for I think like five minutes longer than it should have but we're not going to show
2:25:39
that because uh I think let's skip that well it's fine they won the game so we're not going to go to ham yeah we're
2:25:44
calling that one out because he does make a play here in highlight number three in the mid lane that catches out
2:25:49
uh loose and I think then creates it very difficult for them to get in the big thing here is that you can see Shu knows
2:25:57
that he needs to do something about dinar but unfortunately he doesn't quite know what and this is I actually think
2:26:03
this wins him the game this play from here because that takes out the Jacks you see DK is just in complete shambles
2:26:09
and they lose two people as a result you know Za actually kind of playing like Doran in this series a lot taking a lot
2:26:15
of the pressure absorbing a lot of the pressure and in this particular moment I was watching that going thinking the same thing is D plus like oh okay he
2:26:21
doesn't have narbar maybe we can punish he's like no I'm going to use Shu as a battery to get narbar I'm super big in
2:26:27
this game and then here things get a little bit desperate you know there's an awkward handshake for Barrel as well aiming is not going to be able to secure
2:26:33
a kill here with the bailout because Delight has zonas which is actually pretty massive here and you know desperate times call for desperate
2:26:39
measures I think those last two fights for D+ they were never really in control they tried to make a play on theas they failed had to try to salvage on Baron
2:26:46
and failed as well and I want to highlight this specifically because up until they won one fight like they had
2:26:53
zero turrets and I know that we know the game is quite snowb right now but this to me really does signify I'm not really
2:27:00
looking at win or loss but how does DK look in the game and when they get early map control when they're able to really
2:27:06
play the snowballing style I think this team looks insanely oppressive and here we saw some glimpses of it but really it
2:27:13
did feel like it came down to Zea jumping into three people for the game to kind of get pulled back outside of
2:27:19
that once they lose I think this team is still particularly with drafts like this that are a bit finicky uh kind of
2:27:24
struggling yeah huge huge battle back here by Han life Esports in game number
2:27:29
two against D+ Kia and now all we got to do is decide the winner you know let's
2:27:35
send it on over to two winners right now on the broadcast that's Mr Brendan Valdez and Daniel Ox Harris oh thank you
2:27:41
degon you guys are wienners as well um us cuz I thought he was talking about someone else I'm like oh are we not are
2:27:47
we not cast in and he's like no we're the winners I'm like nice nice yeah I definitely called them winners for sure
2:27:54
uh we're getting ready for game number three DK moving over to the blue side
2:27:59
here unsurprising this is part of the reason why we do favor them going into this game obviously we had to play the
2:28:05
game out and see how it does go H Sports were able to take that last one DK have looked great in Fearless
2:28:12
drafting that last one a bit more even they did go for kind of the wild card with the Koga as well so more
2:28:18
interesting stuff on the way I'm sure sure yeah so going to see a little bit of change of place pace and cuz we're
2:28:24
now on a new side but also the pressure now goes to h because they have to ban scarner in this situation fortunately
2:28:32
they've been kind of freed up from the clis ban from last game that is one of our other most popular bands in the lck
2:28:37
cup uh they will ban that VI again quy ban from D+ hle fans so happy right now
2:28:45
uh Cory if you're not aware 012 in the lck cup uh and I'm many of the Zea fans
2:28:52
have a rough relationship with corki but yeah Cante left open great first pick
2:28:58
for Z but also ambessa left open sorry F pick for Cal but also ambessa so Z could just pick up that himself yeah that's
2:29:05
why they go for the asban and ambessa I feel like Sue Has looked better on
2:29:11
ambessa uh we haven't seen a lot of Shu just yet at least in the AL with ambessa picked I I wonder what Z will pick in
2:29:18
response and he guesses perhaps not but Ania not a huge pressure
2:29:25
to pick it pick it right now but it just kind of cover your hand a bit more it is there so you know not a stranger to
2:29:31
going a different direction don't temp me like this
2:29:37
cam at TR I knew I knew it I knew it I knew
2:29:43
it I knew it and yet I still fell for it that's the thing that bothers me the eight TR I was like oh okay no
2:29:50
no it's like sick cool oh okay well you know let's move on it's no surprise
2:29:57
let's be honest with ourselves we can hope but it's no surprise uh looking at the Jinx object very early pickup for
2:30:04
this um but interesting we've seen Jinx Lulu be pretty powerful in the elk cup
2:30:09
Delight not someone who I would specifically link up as a a Lulu player not not that he can't but more so
2:30:15
leaning into those engaged CHS but very early to pick up the Jinx in to D plus K kind of showing the hand a decent amount
2:30:23
see what D plus K want to do in response why is lucid reacting this way
2:30:30
Kindred and Gallo circles comp immediately comes in yeah so a lot
2:30:39
of power in the Gallo that can kind of set up the Kindred play for those marks
2:30:45
obviously a really strong front line already um I find it funny he keeps hovering when he can't play it you know
2:30:52
yeah he's like I wanted to play yon took it away from me my team picked Jace instead interesting they're looking
2:30:59
towards the Leona the Brom pickup okay more of a defensive pick to try and help
2:31:04
out the Jinx uh I mean decent amount of value in blocking like Kindred damage and I think
2:31:11
the expectation is that Barrel is probably going to play an engage pick to try and Gap close uh cuz they need to
2:31:18
get to that Jinx who has so much range but it definitely means that the light has less agency than we typically see
2:31:23
him have on things like the real like the ran which Speaking of which they might end up just buy Banning things
2:31:29
like the raan that is typically very good into the bro when I see Gallo I think you want to have something to
2:31:35
start the CC chain so Gallo can UL them to follow up especially when you're playing into a jinx so I think Ran's a
2:31:41
good ban I also think you know playing braw the elast could be a really rough
2:31:46
Lane um if you if you just get cocooned and then full combo mod and we know obviously Barrel plays it so yeah well
2:31:53
see I do think raan would be better for the composition as a whole but at least is very barrel uh and they do ban the
2:31:59
raan away so don't have to deal with that in team fights I think that makes a lot of sense Ian ban away I think was
2:32:05
very heads up uh something peut played last year uh to great effect and would
2:32:11
really make it difficult to deal with his Jinx yeah I I do wonder where we're going for the ad carry roll um you know
2:32:20
there have been times where Kindred has been put into the ad carry rooll I don't think that will happen here almost
2:32:27
definitely not um but a lot of stuff has been banned
2:32:33
and played right we've had four 0 carries played we now have Corky band we've got Victor which could technically
2:32:40
be played in that spot band we've got uh obviously Lu and Ash band away yeah not
2:32:46
a huge fan of the vehicle here it it means you have even more momentum in fights but you kind of don't have anyone
2:32:53
to leave the charge on that on that first kill and it's kind of going back to that Fierce composition where they're
2:33:01
like hey you need to come into us and then we're going to be happy but if you don't come into us if you just poke us
2:33:06
down it's a problem and you know what Champion has poke ziggs ziggs is well in the broom really fantastic you can't
2:33:12
really do anything against his ultimate and kind of keeping the distance at all time and I think H just lacking engage
2:33:18
options you know uh in terms of what the composition offers it feels like D+ can really set the set the pace of the game
2:33:24
they have ad from the top side they have a little AP from the mid lane and Zach
2:33:29
going to pick the silus uh something happened by the way
2:33:35
he was hovering it and some it was like silence and someone screamed something I don't know if it was a fan or a player
2:33:41
but the whole crowd laughed and clapped well I mean I'd be pretty happy as a zean in general but here
2:33:48
specifically I don't know I feel like both both you know I think H had some shortcoming in
2:33:54
the game one draft I think game two was a lot more even um although H came out ahead but I think this game too I think
2:33:59
D Plus have a decent Edge in this one I just think H don't have the typical
2:34:05
engaged tools you want and it's not like Silas has a bunch of great options to steal from the nice holds but it's like
2:34:11
Kindred all it's high value but it doesn't really give you the the engage option you can't you know pull a fake
2:34:17
and grab a ranal and dive in like we saw in the world final so you know any
2:34:22
composition if you get a headit early you can set the pace of the game but I think if they fall behind they're gonna have a real tough time and you're
2:34:27
playing into like a zigs a lot of poke a kindred get stacked so I I think you need to shut down Lucid I think that is
2:34:34
very important I need to make sure aiming doesn't take over the game either either they're still definitely Wing cons I just think they don't have as
2:34:40
many tools as D+ do right now yeah I would agree um I'm curious about aiming
2:34:46
on the Z you know how well can he do a lot of the damage will come from the zigs especially if it ends up being tank
2:34:52
Gia which is what we see more often so the zigs Kindred and ambassa DPS
2:34:59
Trio uh could be rough if you're not killing the Jinx so we'll see how it does go we're getting ready for game
2:35:05
number three let's hop on the rift right now
2:35:27
game three on the cards H life Esports have pushed D+ Kia
2:35:32
to the edge to the end of their rope we'll see
2:35:38
how this one does go interestingly enough I mean not seen a dive um I sorry not dive I swap I do
2:35:47
think that if you end up swapping one the advantages with a kindred is that you can dive get that early kill get
2:35:52
that early Mark um those aren't familiar too much with the champion four marks is where you get a big range increase then
2:35:59
it's every three after that you get a smaller one but getting those first four is just when you come alive as a champion so really important I think
2:36:06
that D plus are able to get the hands on those sooner rather than later yeah um I think the biggest
2:36:12
question mark for me in this whole draft was the Veo I think you know it was just a
2:36:17
matter of like you you look through the jungle is that were actually available that like hadn't been picked or went
2:36:23
banned and I think the pool was just small um there was always
2:36:30
Zach just saying true could have played Zach he definitely could have uh Warick
2:36:37
you know also available wow 6 and0 so far with the brao um and I I feel like brao is one of
2:36:44
these picks in my opinion where in the right spot just suffocating you know know you can get so much value so much
2:36:51
power but I also think like in the wrong spot kind of underwhelming and we'll see
2:36:57
what the like can do with it here I mean obviously you know you're playing for a jinx you're trying to keep a save you're trying to proc passive on people you
2:37:02
have a lot of people who stack up your passive quickly but I just don't think it's the best response to the
2:37:08
zigs um and obviously isn't fantastic at interrupting well either yeah it's
2:37:14
definitely not I do remember that Barrel had a great game on it zaka able to to kind of cancel the knockup with his own
2:37:23
by jumping in with the chains and he's doing very well that lane so far show doesn't have his W yet and obviously as
2:37:29
soon as you get that you get that free Magic damage Shield which is a big Advantage now with that pressure from mid plus the pressure from
2:37:36
B we're seeing this red T and this is why I think the swap would have been you know on the one
2:37:42
handan pair is better in a in a swap situation than essad do so I I get them
2:37:47
not want to do it but this is kind of the sacrifice you're making you know you don't have the opportunity for Lucid to
2:37:53
potentially pick up an N Mark with a dive you're also uh suffering a little bit from the any pressure from a jinx
2:37:59
you can just rocket the wave zigs needs a few more points in Q to get going but I don't think it's too much of hit so
2:38:05
you know they're clearly establishing they want the ambessa not to be starved of gold yeah it's really not the end of
2:38:12
the world I think uh actually going to get unlucky here with the mark spawn is
2:38:18
lucid on the bottom one but youve got an opportunity to maybe just go from Scuttle to Scuttle especially look at
2:38:25
the positioning of peanut right now I love this I I love when teams play like this around a kindred um she make it
2:38:32
really we and hard for it it's kind of something I've also talked about with zigs where I feel like ziggs and his ability to take Towers you should kind
2:38:38
of play around that like you play around Kindred like you want to enable him to have power access it kind of feels like
2:38:43
it's too many games going get zigs to hit Towers get Kindred to get Marx if you do both of those you're going to
2:38:49
have a fantastic game yeah I mean it's Team game after all let's see the Smite here goes the way of
2:38:56
lucid and he's just going to kind of waddle away after that one yeah already
2:39:01
got the freebie Mark uh so that's really nice and just a positive start what do
2:39:07
you think about the zig skin by the way wait oh my God I just I just saw something horrible wait
2:39:14
I think aiming misclicked um I think I just saw if I'm cracked here to points
2:39:21
W uh which is just a it's just a misclick yeah that is your and it may
2:39:27
sound like oh you know it's just like is it that big of a deal but like zig's Q is your bread and butter it's going to take a like one of the things is as you
2:39:34
get like level four level five yeah you can see it there two points in W like the Q gets so much stronger with points
2:39:39
in it so a little bit unfortunate and I'm not sure it's going to make a major
2:39:45
difference but he does lose a little bit of his laning power cuz like next level he puts it in ult there it is value
2:39:51
yeah the Poke now it's on cool down for 20 seconds I think I'm not sure how
2:39:58
exactly it happened but it's not the first time a player will made a misclick and I am I'm assuming it is a misclick
2:40:03
because to assume otherwise would be it hit me on a deep level there's no way
2:40:08
anyone would choose to put themselves through that um watch him put a third point in W and you just like leave the
2:40:14
cast I got a got a call of wolf or chronicler you're like no I've had
2:40:20
enough I can't handle it seen enough aiming zigs for one lifetime yeah he honestly he's usually been pretty okay
2:40:27
um as far as it goes so I'm going to give him the benefit of doubt it was a
2:40:32
misclick let's see let's see let's see no no no he's going to Q stop it
2:40:39
Brandon the thing is what you you Max Q then you max e and w is last so it feels even worse because you know you're never
2:40:46
going to have that skill order you wanted to okay trading flashes Flash from flash
2:40:53
yeah yeah he was in a dangerous situation they traded up in sums but now it's a little bit delicate to approach
2:40:59
these grubs they definitely want at least one if they can get the hands on it yeah when near the Zs team as well
2:41:05
would be lovely to get as many as possible zos does have level six here
2:41:11
and Delight just holding the door in front showmaker nice angle here could try to go for it even the zigal going to
2:41:17
do a bit of damage in onto the trying to just create space for that uh grub that
2:41:22
is coming in here comes the silus though and Lucien in a bit of trouble he's not level six down he goes barell goes too
2:41:29
deep and the Essa CU will trade one back but it's Hite vports trading up in a big
2:41:34
way and I feel like this is just H Le doing better homework than D+ in this situation because they moved their
2:41:40
members over they had Z dealing with the midwave they had everyone else there and then Z is able to move in and and see
2:41:46
was so late on this ambassa you can see see if you look at the mini map we already have the stus push pushing in
2:41:53
moves over quicker the fight starts and Barrel's trying to make space for Lucid
2:41:58
to get the Smite but by committing your engage onto Zea you know I mean sorry
2:42:04
onto Zas it's a Cante he doesn't really care and besta comes late and does get a kill but I just think H set up for that
2:42:11
objective better and D plus were too focused on denying the one grub that they it lost them the fight and they
2:42:16
still didn't get the grub yeah and consider current situation where they have a level five Kindred who basically
2:42:23
does nothing you've got a zigs who aled the Braum and has no items right like
2:42:29
they're not really in a great spot they would love to get more items first before they fight with these Champs or
2:42:35
at least level six on your Kindred to stop stuff like you know uh asylus
2:42:40
engaging on you I think the thing is as well if if they played to poke them down and looked for the fight you know if you
2:42:45
killed peanut that's another Mark like you could have just set up in that way I think it was just the wrong call on how
2:42:51
to approach especially when Barrel committed the old uh the combo onto Zas of all people and I know he was low but
2:42:58
it's it's cassant it's not new he's never low he's never low he's low because he chooses to be low he does it
2:43:04
to himself it's like grow in the standings they're doing it for the fans
2:43:10
you know so is Cante I guess all of the Cante fans I mean kanteti does kind of remind
2:43:17
me of a generous Giga Chad he gets a bad rep because I me he has the gigachad mode exactly right he just gets a bad
2:43:23
rep just cuz he's so op yeah I got no beef with cassan as a person just him as
2:43:28
a champion you know that's a problem yeah also his uh his soundtrack his
2:43:35
music they have they play in the brakes the best one it is the best one for sure
2:43:41
we haven't had a lot of uh Things Come Close actually and right now he's leaning
2:43:48
against Z in the bottom Lane so he's fine yeah aing is going the
2:43:54
death grass zigs build again um on what level does that hurt you compared to
2:44:01
like maxing W I mean I'm maxing W I just I I don't even
2:44:10
I mean I think luden is the go-to and the prepared build in in every situation but he has been going this death fire
2:44:15
grass uh build recently a lot I do feel like having like a more sustained damage
2:44:22
is good into this but I feel like you do that by getting LeAndre second um into this composition yeah not necessarily by
2:44:30
the death zos does not care about aiming existence on multiple levels he just
2:44:37
sitting there farming the wave tanking q's and that's about it once again nice
2:44:44
cancelling from Zea I feel like every time he does that he always comes out ahead on the trades yeah Zea pretty good at this silus Champion um to No One
2:44:51
surprise yeah obviously one of these picks that you think silus should oh fited in oh boy and now zacka just going
2:44:58
to seal the Kindred ultimate it's going to get pretty interesting let's see if Luci can burst him down didn't have the E stack but he's burning and it is going
2:45:05
to be a kill to Lucid anyway and it's not the marked Target but it's still a
2:45:10
nice amount of gold a nice injection over to DK and Lucid great patience wait it out and honestly the old from Zea I
2:45:18
think I don't think he was wrong to use it but kind of backfired as well cuz it just meant there was no chance of
2:45:23
killing showmakers cool Downs had come back up he was able to disengage and Lucid not only gets the kill saves his
2:45:28
flash as well which I think is pretty big in this situation fortunately no extra stack on the back of it but it
2:45:35
does set them up nicely to focus on these grubs and with peut on the other side of
2:45:41
the map does deny the stack uh again but does look like it's going to be a triple
2:45:46
grubber for D+ to equalize is already two uh neutral objectives though for H
2:45:53
so they are heading terms of future strength here you know Ze is constantly being cancelling he gets canceled in
2:45:59
return by showmaker and then the AL does let him survive but it also means showmaker can kind of just heal up and
2:46:05
walk it off and the red buff enough to take him down yeah and vgo against
2:46:10
Kindred in the 1 V one you miss a stun you're just uh you're you're a Sitting Duck you just sit there you walk away
2:46:18
obviously ly in a different situation maybe you can Al in if you've got teammates and look for resets that's that's where Vego is going to be strong
2:46:25
but a lot of reset denial when you're playing against Kindred as well so another reason why when we saw that pick
2:46:31
we were like huh interesting yeah I mean I I think the the value of the Kindred
2:46:36
all into like Jinx and vgo cuz I think Jinx alone like yes it slows down the
2:46:42
resets but you know you I just feel like this comp is so much more riing on resets when you have two of them um um
2:46:49
and honestly sometimes I feel like even the vgo can be more relying CU you can be baited when you're Ting in the Kinder
2:46:55
Al can block it then if you hold ult you're not using your Al a lot of value so yeah really heads up pick in this
2:47:02
situation yeah well oh there's there's a mock he's
2:47:07
hunting he's trying to get it and he's not going to get it because already
2:47:13
pulled it in so I think he's still sitting on one which is is not very comfortable you can
2:47:20
see in a cool overlay right next to it uh so yeah four would be big uh while
2:47:27
away from that still they op put suppress on the tower playing around zigs they playing around zigs like you
2:47:32
don't have to gank you don't have to kill Viper just give him some cover uh let aiming hit the tower get some plates
2:47:40
just do that on repeat every time zigs gets to touch a tower a plate goes um
2:47:45
and it is future strength for hle now um uh haven't picked up that second dragon
2:47:51
so they do have that Advantage but I think the more you allow aiming just hit this Tower the better
2:47:57
you're going to feel he has Max this Q by the way yeah
2:48:02
just in case anyone uh yeah in the end like when you're at this point your Q's Max like it's not a big issue I thought
2:48:08
it could you know it makes you a bit weaker in Lane but it hasn't proved to be a problem it's not a big deal just in the moment I saw it I was like yeah
2:48:16
ouch I can guarantee in those moment you always feel awful about it when you accidentally Max the wrong I mean it's
2:48:22
not as bad as when you level the wrong thing when like if you're playing a lease and you want you know you put two
2:48:27
points in E before you get W or something or two points in Q before you you uh get W rather that would feel bad
2:48:37
yeah who got a second Mark by the way just getting the bottom skull crab as spawns
2:48:43
there so getting an opportunity has stolen zigal going to cancel a back
2:48:48
cheeky aiming doesn't have TP so yeah I mean the thing with zigal is I feel like
2:48:53
a lot of the time the damage from it comes from the items he has I mean it does a lot of damage of itself but you
2:48:59
your items need to bolster it it's kind of like when uh Silas steals C assult
2:49:05
never hits as hard yeah never does as much and it's kind of a similar thing where like it's not not terrible to take
2:49:11
but the damage isn't that crazy I think re actually has a really high AP ratio so I think in terms of like aggressive
2:49:18
combat power dive in the back and it it actually can do a significant amount ofage so maybe that's Z looks toal later yeah there's
2:49:25
definitely a lot of like random support and like jungle tank alts that have
2:49:30
really high AP ratios I I think like the Zach it's cuz they they never get AP and
2:49:36
they give them big AP ratios so like when they get Baron it's nice but I remember they did this with n they buff
2:49:41
the AP ratio on narl yeah and N didn't care but silus was just absolutely feasting it's better AR
2:49:49
and we saw both the Champs in this series but not in this same
2:49:55
game makes sense uh she having a pretty good time up against the cassant just two guys
2:50:01
going head to-head and there's an Al not sure the heal was needed I think Viper maybe
2:50:07
concerned uh sorry Delight concerned that maybe Viper wouldn't get out the center but I think that wasn't exactly
2:50:13
massively needed looks like aiming is going towards LeAndre next which gives a ton of damage for
2:50:20
zigs um especially a lot of lot of Health stackers on the side of H yeah I think the thing is like you
2:50:27
could go like a more Ang going be of Squishies with like Horizon Focus but the thing is you'll still do a lot of
2:50:33
damage to Viper uh and this way you're actually damaging everyone else so I think it's the right call although I'm
2:50:38
not a big fan of the death fire
2:50:43
grasp yeah or is it blackf for is different that I not on zigs but I I'm a
2:50:50
fan of that you know it's also a name in one of the songs of uh pent I'm just
2:50:57
picturing like a zigs like Satchel in using the death by grasp and then just
2:51:03
alting hell yeah assassin zigs you Max your W for extra engage
2:51:10
power absolutely so cursed so they they got a third Mark by the way spawn to the
2:51:17
bottom side and H were like H whatever yeah so one away from the big spike if they can get that that would be
2:51:23
ideal uh very even gold hat of the ahead in objectives uh obviously
2:51:29
so but I think D+ okay with that as long as he can keep getting some more marks right now it is set on Zea uh I love how
2:51:37
they both have like portraits next to their names you know
2:51:43
yeah uh and I think this is concerning to give over a dragon a third dragon
2:51:48
free already it's so early for H to have three dragons from Mountain soul will they though that's the question I mean
2:51:54
she's coming up yeah if they can get the Kindred there hard to do a 50/50 against
2:51:59
the Kindred with the power of the ult stolen out I think this is a great call from deed night they throw the Harald mid to force H to respond and now can
2:52:08
get their way in here Mountain solver H would be massive lot of bulk but also just keeping that Jinx safe so I would
2:52:15
not want to give this third Dragon over no matter what they will look to get aiming just going to Satchel the tower they'll take that mid tier one easily
2:52:21
enough and they're happy just forcing hle away from the dragon don't need to start it right now just keep them off it yeah but how
2:52:29
long can they do it for you know Peanut's just going to start it up again and there's a lot of gold in the pockets
2:52:34
of DK that they'd love to spend but they can't so they got to stick around they got to fight over this mountain
2:52:40
Drake and just trying to look there is another Mark actually in The Jungle which I believe is being uh shown here
2:52:48
by the big zoom out also the multiple different angles by which both teams are trying to just Converge on this
2:52:55
objective and he's got to recall TP back in he wants to spend Lucid hitting it at the moment he can just get out the pit
2:53:01
at any time leandre's picked up for aiming big spike he's got two items compared to Viper one so I think that
2:53:08
might be enough for DK to say okay you want to fight we'll give it to you yeah Power of
2:53:14
TP and power of backing out of vision as well h
2:53:19
not really able to do much about that and trying to get peut close to the objective but already the zigs pooke is
2:53:26
coming in but here comes zeka trying to get in there but the re pretty good onto that front line and she was buying a lot
2:53:32
of time in the back has the Gallo on top a thre man knockup and Viper though did
2:53:38
get the one reset can he do enough damage is really the question able to chip away at showmaker but not willing
2:53:43
to take the 3v4 and that will be the dragon going into the hands of D plus Kia huge for D plus there denying the
2:53:50
soul stacking towards Soul sorry and I think the fight execution really good they're now also trying to defend this
2:53:56
bot Lane Tower and a little bit risky I think yeah the door is held so uh Luci
2:54:03
did also fail as Dash I think it's fine to give it up uh I actually think aiming
2:54:08
can get this mid tier two by himself which is kind of absurd although
2:54:14
we might have to wait around another wave which could be risky he's going to do it he's the gold
2:54:20
for this is what he does he's cycling his ability trying to get that passive up but he gets it low enough the Satchel
2:54:25
does the job and I think with the one for one Tower trade more than happy you see Zea coming from the flank I think D+
2:54:32
do a phenomenal job of healing these threats barel that engage really amazing
2:54:38
yes Zea stasis is so he doesn't get taken out but it stalls out the fight and this G World from showmaker massive
2:54:45
forat knockup really just disrupts H's chance of having any momentum takes out the vgo and gets them the reward really
2:54:52
well played uh I think from barrel and showmaker particularly there yeah also
2:54:58
the the initial poke that was coming out from aiming onto Pina really made it difficult for pina to have much of an
2:55:04
impact at all right like we saw Viper get the reset but this is one of the issues I feel like with this H Le
2:55:09
composition is you don't have reliable engage in your comp you're kind of
2:55:14
relying on Zea finding a flank angle OAS and and if D+ know that so as long as
2:55:20
they have their flanks covered as long as they're on the lookout for these divers these aggressors they can just
2:55:25
peel and poke peel and poke and then the second you over commit they'll just take the team fight and you got to remember they have a kindred as well yeah so many
2:55:32
tools to respond now they looking top TP is coming in behind yeah you got to be
2:55:38
careful I mean taking it slow and steady and and peel and poke uh they're kind of out of position for that the engage braw
2:55:44
ultimate going to catch showmaker he has to flash away big zigs bom over the top though into the satchel and now in the
2:55:51
backline sh finds the angle and this should absolutely go the way of deep
2:55:56
plus Kia nice pull back there from zus to get himself to safety but now Aon available D plus Kia want
2:56:03
more yeah Z no TP and super low they recalling they're giving up on the objective huge for D+ a lot of damage
2:56:10
put out there by aiming and as well you can see moving through the show not
2:56:17
even when H wanted to move through that choke is just not the ideal place to fight against the zigs the mines on the
2:56:23
ground really disrupt in for issue trying to look this Tower but I think
2:56:29
best just clear it out yeah yeah I mean you consider the spot
2:56:36
we're in now like gold might look even but there's really still no answer for
2:56:41
the zigs unless aiming okay nice Satchel he's just going to hop his way to safety
2:56:47
but yeah this is this is the choke of Doom right here so flight walk through a bunch of Mines they move forwards ult
2:56:54
gets a lot of value there even through the lock see a great grab onto the bom new is cool down to down he actually to
2:57:01
use the unbreakable to walk through the Minefield uh and Z has a great ult he would have just certainly died if he
2:57:07
hadn't be able to get out but he gets away he doesn't change the the course of the
2:57:12
fight and now I think this is another example of a situation where you don't need to dive and go crazy there's no
2:57:20
good response from hle you have poke from D+ you have peel H don't have great
2:57:25
engage you can just threaten the tower quite comfortably yeah he's taking a lot
2:57:30
of free damage from Viper yeah maybe don't some reason he's trying to
2:57:36
aggressively get in there and speaking of w over the top with the zigs as well they do have the Aon BFF that's a couple
2:57:42
of revives already on the cards TP trying to really uh
2:57:48
yeah I capitalize on getting it from Barrel I think part of this was the fact that a had taken so much damage so like
2:57:55
okay well let's just engage but they didn't even get the tower right they they really just didn't get value from
2:58:00
the attam buff so don't think that really went the way D+ wanted it to but
2:58:06
it's kind of the thing where they have the buff they like oh let's just dive and then now you wasted the buff I mean Zeo wasted his TP which is what I was
2:58:13
very much focused on but yeah this was not clean at all yeah I mean aiming should not be this low getting HED out
2:58:18
by a jinx well played by Viper but shouldn't really happen and although we get the bro we don't get anything else
2:58:25
you know in terms of having an attam bu you should hope for a lot more in live
2:58:30
Zea in trouble you see trying to block the Silas from dashing another knockup comes in zeeka okay going to buy some
2:58:37
time does he have a chance he doesn't have a flash anymore and yeah that's going to be the end of him nice pick off
2:58:43
there just by his time I think maybe the hope is we can get the dragon before they get here in time and Lucid is very
2:58:48
far away but Hy don't don't P yeah which it
2:58:56
kind of feels like the right call if I'm being honest you would just get smashed in a fight right now but just means Z
2:59:02
kind of died for nothing zga dies for nothing any tped up to that wave so he stuck around as we
2:59:09
were watching the replay and uh by the way the mark also secured by Lucid up a
2:59:16
full Champion now he is
2:59:22
real yeah and we'll watch this replay all the speed up there from
2:59:29
showmaker gets like the I think like the max range knock up as well close to and
2:59:34
yeah the problem is he he ends up Z using before the O ends he going to heal but I going to be he's dead anyway there's nothing he can do in this
2:59:39
situation he's just buying time for his team
2:59:45
um yeah not really able to to make anything off it right now two M Dres two
2:59:51
D+ so some nice extra resistances got a Gallo who appreciates that even
2:59:56
like H lucid and TI are pretty bulky and yeah aiming has done a lot of damage
3:00:02
that is that is ziggs that is Zs and he's done a bunch to the structures as
3:00:08
well so you got to factor that in you you're able to take down the mid tier
3:00:14
two very easily because you have a zig on your team and it's offers you so much more map control there's only one turret
3:00:20
that's been taken by H life compared to four and yeah I said it before you know the gold looks somewhat even but a
3:00:26
couple Mountain Drakes you know a fifth stack here now for the Kindred things are really beginning to get out of
3:00:32
control but aiming is in the middle of no man land and he's going to get showmaker in there as well he flashes
3:00:38
away but Z gets the kill zeka will be traded for it though we'll see what this Kendrick can do Lucid flashing over the
3:00:44
top peanut not able to get away showmaker buying a lot of time but that is a Fed a pretty excited Jinx rather
3:00:51
looking to go on the hunt so DK not going to play with their food and just run away although yeah zoos goes in with
3:00:58
the TP and suu trying to peel for the team this could get pretty dangerous the zap
3:01:04
on top of C the knock back and see they just got to leave him there's no hope for him and that should be another kill
3:01:10
right into the hands of Viper yeah very late kill as well so they can potentially reset look for this bar and
3:01:15
if they get back in time I keep saying Z instead of Z cuz I see hle Z and I'm like it's Z but no it's
3:01:23
not it's z um very scop fight aiming mispositioning a decent amount does use
3:01:28
the Satchel defensively but the bom Al catches him and on a
3:01:33
mission it works you know you step up too far even that works and I think this fight could have been even more in favor
3:01:39
of H but peanuts very split can't really make the most of his reset but even so
3:01:44
like showmaker doesn't have armor you T Viper you're just going to die uh and then this chase down this TP from
3:01:51
Z the new teleport I feel like it's obviously learning the timings of like how quickly
3:01:56
do you cuz I was like is he going to be there in time to even do anything the answer is yes uh and they get the Slate kill not gone for the bar in the replay
3:02:04
I was hoping they' maybe be able to set up around the objective but from the looks of it they haven't really done much of that either Luci got a sixth
3:02:10
stack by the way he got the fifth from the Scuttle crab and he got the sixth in the fight from the vgo so very close
3:02:17
close to seven and as you mentioned you know once you have four you're like a real Champion but you get seven you get
3:02:22
10 you can start to take over the game the Kindred we talked a lot about the zigs what it's able to do but the
3:02:28
Kindred I listed as one of the big carries as this game comes along yeah got fed early as well as just a boost to
3:02:34
your range as well you know I feel like that's the one Edge that like H had was
3:02:40
like this long range Auto attacker if Lucid also becomes longrange Auto attacker you got nothing um
3:02:48
do see hatti setting up in the area wanting to secure the skull
3:02:55
crab trying to land some hope the offensive W Satchel we've had a couple
3:03:01
of fights in a row that were very messy from both sides It Felt Like H vports
3:03:07
felt a bit more in control of that top fight that they actually lost where they had like the flanking TP coming in but DK did a great job backing away and then
3:03:13
retaking the fight with the zig damage as they came through the choke and that second also very broken up kind of all
3:03:20
over the place Viper not able to link resets excited resets into more kills I
3:03:26
do wonder what a fight looks like at this point in time if it's just like a straight front to back I feel like DK
3:03:32
should probably try not to get caught out yeah I think when it's split that's
3:03:38
when hle starts to get advantages and once someone goes down like the increased mobility of vle gets or the
3:03:44
Jinx excitedness allows him to really start to to clean up fights I I think
3:03:49
when D+ have it stru in a structured front to back I I think it's hard for hle uh dragon up for 25 seconds third fr
3:03:55
the team they definitely want to look to contest this Z is walking down as TP not quite available neither is see who's
3:04:02
right now so he might have to move soon Pina is fishing all right stun landed I mean
3:04:09
they're they're forcing DK back they're taking a lot of map control here and vision control around the
3:04:14
objective push in mid you know Jinx easily able to match that he had blue buff which is really helping with the
3:04:20
Rockets clear and DK's actually threatening Baron perhaps they're coming
3:04:26
up here clearing out the vision and they're just going to start it they say okay Dragon we don't care about that we
3:04:32
want to go for the baron they want to pull them into and also Z is running up but he's still quite far away not making
3:04:37
the decision to TP def will pull away from it they want to defend this mid tier one don't want
3:04:42
to give it up for free and I think HD really making the right call there you know attacking mid
3:04:49
instead of the baron calling D plus buff and kind of just stolen things out and if you look Z is pushing bot Lane again
3:04:55
he's still has TPS fineing with it this is Cante you see showmakers like do I
3:05:00
engage on this guy even though he's standing right next to me the answer is no it's Cante uh death sense picked up
3:05:06
by Zu and tp's back in think it's just going to be a straight up fight over the
3:05:12
dragon stun here on the Z is's not able to go Unstoppable for a bit but he's so tanky doesn't really matter and setting
3:05:19
up on this one te he's got a pretty massive flank but spotted Z as well the two Z's coming
3:05:27
over the top as now they try to turn on to zeeka as he does go golden and it's stolen by Lucid he gets the dragon so
3:05:34
many low healths and Barrow goes in and just Stacks the front line there for his
3:05:39
DPS and you seees as is all alone on the back of the fight he's going to be run
3:05:44
down this should be three for the side of deep Plus in both dragons three
3:05:50
Mountain Drakes three kills eventually who's going to pick it up is the only question it does go to showmaker of all
3:05:58
people and yeah just a massive fight here for DK once again I think if the dragon hadn't gone to D+ they would
3:06:04
still be happy with the outcome of that fight but the fact that they got the steel as well is icing on the cake Lucid
3:06:10
has been dominating the Smite battles over peanut so far this series and once
3:06:15
again it's paying dividends three mountains and Mountain dragons a four mountain mountain Soul would be absurd and now they know Z is dead for a while
3:06:22
they're heading over to the baron we'll see the replay the thing is it's hard to win a Smite fight against a kindred
3:06:27
because of the ultimate but this is just Lucid grabbling you know nothing else needed just a raw Smite coming through
3:06:34
the damage from uh aiming was huge and that Barrel follows up beautifully on it and then Z looks for aiming but kind of
3:06:41
hard you know he uses his CC but aiming would have had to Satchel defensively and so he just kind of disengages
3:06:47
and now D pick up the baron as well 5,000 gold lead they are on a fantastic
3:06:53
position in this game it's just very comfortable uh you talked about it in the draft what feels like ages ago like
3:07:00
40 minutes ago it's actually 32 minutes ago well not exactly because we had like
3:07:06
the draft and then maybe like 34 the the camera shots and we saw the the drafts
3:07:11
on the wall 35 okay you 35 yeah okay 35 probably closer I'll give you do
3:07:18
that and yeah t now with Baron and zigs uh try to engage on aiming what you
3:07:26
still have to do you still have to find the flank it's just a struggle and especially Z like last fight he went in
3:07:31
with gal like what are you supposed to do nearly died to Lucid he's doing so much damage now yeah like what are you
3:07:37
supposed to do with Z you went into a fight with gallol he's supposed to like Dash in and then ult out it just
3:07:44
and now he's got Kindred Al how are you supposed to engage with this you know I feel like especially when it was such a
3:07:50
late pick off the Silas the ults they're not in isolation bad but for what they
3:07:57
need they just don't offer it I'd actually I'd prefer grab the Rel and just dive in proto Bell well I guess
3:08:04
it's rocket Bell now and just oh boy press off yeah it's not Zia but you know
3:08:09
it it's still a 0 carry that doesn't have a lot of mobility in Jinx and you're just able to do that as Zs just
3:08:16
having uh a really fun time against this the rocket doesn't do anything they're
3:08:21
not able to actually break the inhibitor turret funnily enough just waiting for the next wave still have a minute and a
3:08:28
half to go sh doing a good job of pushing in mid yeah the only thing is aiming is a bit low so some good poke
3:08:34
that did come out uh from Viper uh but I just don't think there's anything to punish him and again they
3:08:41
have the kindal I I I think the re would have done better for them um but I still
3:08:46
think it's just best a a rough Bunch for the situation they get the tower here
3:08:52
looks like they're going to keep pushing man in a lot of trouble this vgo just doing absolutely nothing the whole game
3:08:59
really living up to the paper man that is the nickname we gave to him
3:09:04
and aiming I feel like he's great at taking Viper was playing lethality Jinx they
3:09:11
would actually be doing better right now he's hitting W's he's hitting zaps on a on aiming he's hitting ALS but it's just
3:09:18
it's not enough you know you force them off fantastic that it is good but you're not actually really changing the state
3:09:24
of the game Baron's been used 3,500 Red Bull Baron power play dragon soul in a
3:09:29
minute for mountain mountain Drake would be massive especially you know you have stuff like Lucid harder to beer him easy
3:09:36
to get the ult off show makeer you get extra damage from your magic resist and now aiming just picked up a Rabbid on uh
3:09:43
shiu just picked up a ga we have the electri of iron as well for Barrel they know this is likely the
3:09:50
last fight of the game and they are feeling confident yeah the zigs so comfy he's got Gall Al he's got Kinder adults
3:09:56
you know he can just build only damage items the whole way very glad he didn't go for like a serifs or anything like
3:10:03
that totally unnecessary you don't need it you can just go for I don't think he went perhaps the
3:10:09
optimal damage but you know what I'm not going to pick I'm not going to not going to criticize he has some good items he does some good damage he does have
3:10:16
damage items which is I you know I was trying to you know highlight that positive at least and he's doing a great
3:10:22
job with it so far uh potentially a final fight here H really have to fight for this one you cannot give Mountain
3:10:28
soul to a four Mountain Drake team and they're just still trying to find the
3:10:34
angle on zigs the story hasn't changed steal re or essel and just try and make it happen I think that's your best
3:10:39
option he found a flank again oh they're trying to get in and the engage Brum surprisingly doesn't work no flash and
3:10:45
aiming now though yeah and oh no that bomb just gigantic damage
3:10:53
and the light's like what do I do now I don't even have my alss so he's going to miss his but again it doesn't matter cuz
3:10:59
they get Mountain Soul the damage at the bottom it's just an easy stand off akk didn't need kills they just needed the
3:11:07
dragon they're still going for more I mean might as well but yeah
3:11:13
kante are they killable I don't think so in any
3:11:19
sense you got a level 15 vgo up against Lucid who is quite fed
3:11:25
okay attemp they have a flank angle the flank angle this is what we've been talking about Z trying to get to the
3:11:31
back line the flash on aiming he finally got onto the zigs the damage is decent
3:11:36
but the Kindred ultimate keeps aiming alive and they cannot take him down showaker runs in front just string his
3:11:44
stuff in the face of the Jinx and there is just no way to attacks this attack
3:11:49
this six the entire game aiming can TP into the fight now as well as peut has
3:11:55
to back away from this one they don't have a wave right now actually they're trying to get it low enough instead
3:12:00
they're just going to get the Champions low enough and get three more kills the wave comes in and the game and the
3:12:07
series is over D+ Kia move to 4 and zero and take down H life Esports PR strong
3:12:14
performance I think going into this my expect a was a D+ it just looked a bit better so far but even so I expected
3:12:22
this to be a big challenge In fairness HD definitely put up a fight but right now it's it's definitely clear that D+
3:12:28
are our strongest team right now they have looked the best in the play we've seen so far undefeated only bro left to
3:12:36
go undefeated in groups and pushing up group Elders score even more and I
3:12:44
really think that like the fact that they've won against both in T1 they being a big reason why gelda pulled so
3:12:50
far ahead he's like showing off the sponsors he's like by the way shout out to our
3:12:56
sponsors also shout out to D plus Kia I don't think the players all played fantastic but also I think Fearless just
3:13:03
feels to have benefited them they've shown so much flexibility in the champion pools it feels like even when we get later in series The cohesion is
3:13:11
still there from the draft showmaker feels like can play anything and a rough one for H they
3:13:17
still put up a good fight I think we have to remember that it was a three- game series but it just wasn't quite enough on the
3:13:23
day yeah it wasn't enough I I think com life Esports still a strong team you're going to look at their uh score line and
3:13:30
see two and two but they lost to two very strong teams in D plus Kia and gen
3:13:36
gen has been more up and down obviously but they lost at the beginning of the series funnily enough this started off
3:13:41
pretty well for Life Esports they had this fight and we were like oh maybe they can get it done yeah this was like the best part of the game for H Le but
3:13:49
after that it just felt like they didn't have the options to engage and I think they didn't have the tools is ultimately
3:13:54
how i' view it I do think that it's not just about the draft I think D+ played really well but I also think that out of
3:14:01
the three games we had this is the one where there was a a major draft Gap that I think caused issues for H Le and they
3:14:07
try to find work arounds Viper was getting some good poke down on the Jinx we saw Z and Zea both trying to find
3:14:13
these flank angles but just so hard the peel I I would say was really good from D+ uh the
3:14:20
exception being this moment but even then uh it still didn't go that far in
3:14:25
favor of hle it wasn't enough for them to get the baron it just kind of stole the game out a little bit longer and D
3:14:31
bounced back I think Lucid had a really fantastic series uh I think Barrel had some great moments
3:14:36
showmaker uh I think shiu also was scary on this amb best in the late game like
3:14:42
when he went for the 1 V one against peanut yeah and it just feels like this team are withing so well together you
3:14:48
think bringing AI in as much as bar has played with Team before you know it was a
3:14:53
different jungler it was Canyon it just feels like the team are working so well as a unit despite having
3:15:00
switched out quite a few pieces and especially up against the team like H who only changed the top laner they were
3:15:06
summer Champions only changed the top laner and yet D plus it feels like they've adapted to these
3:15:12
Chang a lot of yelling it's showmaker and it's Lo
3:15:18
and Barrel of course can out aiming and two they're they're not going to talk
3:15:24
much aiming sometimes they're just locked in yeah locked in doing their job and you can
3:15:30
see the hype the happy about it you know this was a big match to take down this was a big statement um the reigning
3:15:36
Champs from last summer aiming doing a ton of damage as zigs does for Vi also
3:15:42
doing a lot and I feel like kind of feel bad he had a really strong Jinx performance given the but you just can't do more in this
3:15:49
scenario didn't have the tools to set them up yeah I mean Viper he's one of the best ad carries in the world he
3:15:56
played quite well today I I think you put any AD carry in this position and
3:16:02
they're probably not getting it done just by this feels reminiscent of game two uh yesterday T1 B KT when uh you
3:16:10
know we saw smash just trying to do everything just didn't quite come together and sometimes that's the way the crumbles it's Team game at the end
3:16:16
of the day and uh and the better team on the day one yeah a lot of threats as well you know even if they do kill the
3:16:22
zigs like probably late in the game Viper would pop off and it would be an issue but youve got the zigs you've got
3:16:28
the Kindred who is farming very well you've got sh on the ambessa even showmaker was building tank but Lucid he
3:16:34
is going to be the one that picks up the player of the match tonight yeah I mean I think it's F had some pretty good
3:16:40
performances was doing some great moves on the Wukong uh thenly as well I mean I
3:16:45
feel like that was more controlled one but yeah I think I'm going to be honest I think there was a lot of votes that were pretty valid in this one I think
3:16:52
you'd still got to find someone who just wasn't deserving at all so I wonder if we will see a mix in terms of votes I didn't personally vote for Lucid but I
3:16:58
think it's a very valid one who did you vote for maybe you'll have to see on that one what what's your comment going
3:17:04
to be today ax oh just curious see you got to think about it casters have a little bit of less time cuz they got to
3:17:11
like put it in towards the end yeah I'm processing like you can just see my brain just desk are sitting there just waiting like hm what should I do they
3:17:17
got like 20 minutes as the game is ending I mean I feel like as well like when you when you're on the desk you
3:17:22
have time to prep it more well guys we have the interview I'm going to hand it over to our translator take it
3:17:28
away thank you very much guys this is dear for the LK cup P interview
3:17:33
translation joined by Lucid on the side of D plus Kia
3:17:39
congratulations the captain of grp Baron hunter life Esports and you took them down and get to continue your undefeated
3:17:45
run how do you feel yeah being able to win makes me really happy and I think I feel like we
3:17:52
definitely contributed to our group which is very delightful you know especially in game
3:17:58
one dropped the last R5 Malai pick was highly pred by the analyst so
3:18:07
can you walk us through how the team decided to go with maai you know maai was really good going
3:18:12
into the enemy comp and I think being able to uh scale I think that's just
3:18:19
something that barl also really wanted to play so he was very proactive in picking this and in game three despite
3:18:26
the high tier priority pick Cante being open you took Essa first and after
3:18:32
giving out kante you completed a kindred Gallo comp so what was the cor strategy
3:18:39
here you know she was really good with kante but I think he said that he was more confident witha
3:18:49
you know Kindred I was a little timid about playing Kindred but our team
3:18:54
actually encouraged me so I just went ahead and and locked her in I think we're really getting along in
3:19:02
the team D plus just how are you so good as the only undefeated team in the AL cup
3:19:09
with a 4 and zero record what is C+ Kia's biggest strike you know in this
3:19:15
meta team fighting is is really important and I think our team is very good at Team fighting so I think we will
3:19:21
be able to keep on and finish up the group with an undefeated
3:19:29
run it looks like you your birthday is coming up so happy birthday would you like to say anything
3:19:35
to your fans you know the holidays are coming up
3:19:41
the Lunar New Year and my family or my my birthday as well so I hope everyone
3:19:46
has a great holiday only one group battle match
3:19:51
remains and your opponent is okay savings F Bon who recently pulled an upset so what is your
3:19:58
resolution you know be losing in the kaspa cup really makes me want to get my
3:20:05
payback and I want to make sure that we end the group battle with a five and
3:20:11
zero record and that's the end of the interview with lucid and back to the space thank
3:20:22
you thank you very much dear congratulations D+ on the Victory and now lck global would like to present
3:20:29
lucid dreams thank you so much for coming in
3:20:36
for another session today chronicler I think we did make a lot of progress last time talking about your love of the
3:20:43
Scooby-Doo liveaction movies and how no one really understands like how much you enjoy them they're just underrated okay
3:20:50
I you know we made a lot of progress let's leave that in the last session but
3:20:55
today you gave me a note that you wanted to talk to me about D+ Kia tell me about
3:21:02
were actually they were actually called Dum One gaming back back when I really started to believe again that the lck
3:21:10
could get back to the top because there were a couple of dark years where we basically lost everything and then this
3:21:15
Challenger team came up up and they were so creative and they were so fun to watch and then they won in 2020 and then
3:21:21
I got to join the lck and then I had to watch them lose by
3:21:27
a single game two times in that year and I just it it it got to me you know and
3:21:34
you started to feel like you couldn't trust this team anymore is that what you're saying no because they kept
3:21:40
making these roster moves that they didn't understand and they let go a barrel and I know that half the time that guy just kind of runs it but the
3:21:47
other half the magic that he was able to create and the fact that he won worlds
3:21:53
after he Lo left the team and showmaker and Canyon were just kind of left to fend for themselves and it just felt
3:21:59
like the magic wasn't there anymore um was your father a D+ or Dom
3:22:05
One gaming fan as well I I know he I mean he like League
3:22:11
of Legends cuz you know I'm I'm there I don't think I've ever talked to him about it okay just we have to ask these
3:22:17
questions in these sessions just to make sure there's nothing you know it's it's just yeah it's a sensitive topic you know cuz I I I'm so I want to believe so
3:22:26
badly and you you you you mentioned in your initial Note coming to the session that you have some traumas um like a mid
3:22:33
cidan in a grand finals and something about a Kellen alisar um you know is
3:22:39
that something that's still Weighing on you heavily well it's not just it's not just Ken Alistair right there's also moham at Worlds
3:22:47
there was there was us getting Kana and then him just kind of being there for a year and I don't really remember
3:22:52
anything that happened but I know it was all bad and then showmaker and Canyon broke up and then they got Lucid who I
3:22:59
thought was going to save the whole team and then last year was just more of the same and in any of those years where you
3:23:05
started to feel like maybe you could trust and maybe the roster decisions weren't always right and maybe Thanos
3:23:10
perhaps you know somebody you mentioned don't remind me of fos I I'm just looking up I'm on Google right now I'm
3:23:16
finding out some of this stuff um you know maybe they didn't have the the start that you expected but in any of
3:23:22
those years did they have an explosive 40 start to a group stage beating top
3:23:29
teams no it's just always week one and then after week one you know I get excited again and I I think that they
3:23:36
can do it and then they nose dive or they throw a 10k gold lead and and cause
3:23:42
Atlas to go bald that's but but they they've done it
3:23:47
they they're four and zero they may have now you and I are almost out of time for this session but I want to let you know
3:23:55
that there are a lot of other people out there just like you who want to believe in D+ Kia know that you are not
3:24:04
alone like myself for example I chose showmaker for player of the match and I
3:24:11
made the quote showmaker is back because it looks like a return to form for the bid laner who has had some ups and downs
3:24:17
over the last few years I I just I just want to believe I
3:24:23
I want to believe that they can do it I want to Dare To Dream but it scares me right even with Lucid being as good as
3:24:30
he is not even mad about the fact that showmaker didn't get P cuz he was just
3:24:35
so good it reminds you of your early days of the lck doesn't it does yeah it
3:24:42
does it's okay for things to change because sometimes the more things change the more they stay the same speaking of
3:24:48
changes we had Ox join since then and that's been a big upgrade for us he's looking at showmaker as well world
3:24:53
champion form is it the year for your second hey that's that's that's what I
3:24:59
mean that's I'm having those thoughts you know that's what that's what any DK fan I imagine is is thinking we've been
3:25:05
waiting for years it's healthy to dream this big I don't think it's healthy it's healthy to have these thoughts because
3:25:11
sometimes tragedy can happen we have stages of grief and the last one of of course his acceptance and now you can
3:25:18
start over again with stage one with d Plus keia in 2025 let's hear from Rascal he says DK's
3:25:24
brain he gets it I you know for as much as Atlas has memd Barrel as a shot
3:25:32
collar it is undeniable that the team looks completely different right we see the
3:25:39
join showmakers eyes we see them actually have good mid to late game macro which is something that I don't
3:25:44
think they've showed since 201 21 and goo here saying Lucid is the
3:25:50
Vanguard of rebuilding the D+ Dynasty do you feel like he's a player that's
3:25:56
joined one of D Plus's rosters he's the rookie you can trust I I think I can you
3:26:01
know I already I wanted to believe last year and then at some crucial points that that Fai wasn't really rewarded but
3:26:08
I think this year is different I think that he's showing that he is just that
3:26:14
guy the seed is D pluses with Lucid I think that's a pun on Lucid um the end
3:26:21
of his name in Korean being seed not entirely sure what he means but they are currently first seed in the elder group
3:26:28
the stronger group so perhaps that's what he means I'm getting this feeling
3:26:33
from somewhere above that perhaps it's a reference to him getting the seed for first stand well that that's how it's looking
3:26:41
right now and I just I can't believe it with you know T1 being spring T1 and
3:26:46
just not looking that hot and then gen losing the bro and then H life just being beaten by them those are their
3:26:52
main competitors excuse me this is a private session a private session hello I was I was trying to did you take my
3:26:59
jacket why does this one not fit I was sharing some deep stuff de gone can you can you not uh Dr gone your session is
3:27:06
at 4:30 it oh okay well uh you know what you can you can still dream about a
3:27:13
great D+ Kia for in zero congrats one more game though could potentially let
3:27:19
you down I'm just going to wear this small one here let's take a look at the P votes right SI Jack as we uh come back
3:27:26
from getting our feelings out there six of 11 a lots of Believers across all the
3:27:32
different roles here for deep plus Kia who would you have voted for Dr gone Dr
3:27:38
gone I would have voted for showmaker showmaker played great I'm not I'm not
3:27:43
mad at at any any of these votes I was actually saying to Wolf as well the vote I feel like that wasn't warranted was
3:27:48
shiu Barrel was self-explanatory given his engages but even aiming I think that zix game he had the one mistake where he
3:27:55
got caught but outside of that actually played it really cleanly I was so tempted to vote for Barrel like I was about this close he had had great maai
3:28:02
game the rata game wasn't one of the wins so I could just delete it from my memory and then I was looking at game three like okay some of those rata
3:28:09
engages were phenomenal so I was pretty happy with that spread there only one barrel vote but at least he got some credit well after that victory it is a
3:28:17
undefeated D plus Kia on the standings as we take a look at the group standings
3:28:22
group Elder 11 wins to six to group Baron in Hana life Esports as that
3:28:28
number one seed for group Baron just more questions as this lck cup has gone
3:28:33
on I just can't believe that DK is the only team that so far is undefeated and it's crazy too because you could look at
3:28:38
it and say okay group Baron is the weaker team right they only have six wins but they beat T1 one of the stronger teams coming into this and then
3:28:44
Han life Esports a team we thought had the best roster coming into lck cup and sure they're underperforming but D+
3:28:51
closing out that series proving that some of those earlier wins were not flukes well a the best team after week
3:28:57
one in group Baron was d uh DN freaks they had the opportunity to make a huge
3:29:03
upset against geneng G who are trying to recover from an upset earlier in the week will they be able to do it we'll
3:29:09
find out after this short break

the inut clue hi
3:46:40
[Music] teing hello and welcome back to the lck
3:46:46
cup we're here for the second match of the night we got the DN freaks up against gen G and this one is a very
3:46:53
interesting match because the DM praks actually kind of on uh you know a little bit of a rocky start or bit of back and
3:47:01
forth right they lost to DRX but they're also doing pretty okay at times like you could see where their strengths lie and
3:47:08
Genji lost to Bro zero I think if we didn't have that bro series it would
3:47:14
have been a great loss for the world cuz that was a fantastic series but also I think people would be a lot more down on
3:47:20
DM freak's chances in this matchup I think geni definitely didn't look on form uh in that matchup and even I mean
3:47:27
not just that one but when they played against the uh when they played against bnk yeah it definitely felt like they
3:47:34
were close to losing that one game I mean they didn't and we've had like that before but it was kind of like H you know not the best form but then the
3:47:42
match against bro was just I mean bro played really well I think that's the thing you have to say is I'm not going to sit here and pretend that like geni
3:47:48
played their best and bro toppled that went at their best for sure they definely played down but bro played
3:47:55
really well and I don't think that any team can beat gen I think bro really had
3:48:00
to rise up the occasion so the freaks it's definitely possible we've seen it done but they do need to rise up the
3:48:06
occasion if they want to take down gen cuz they definitely will not want to lose two in a row that's for sure I mean
3:48:12
at this point you've got a little bit of a buffer right because there is uh you
3:48:18
know bnk below you and technically you could tie up but you're feeling okay you
3:48:24
know every single game win that you get uh could be very powerful dnf looking to escape their lost streak versus geni in
3:48:31
shock after the loss against bro twitch chat knew I mean we all played our bxs especially Leo the numbers I'll remember
3:48:39
him forever uh Angry geni on a six match winning streak against this team not
3:48:45
this roster but the team can they uplift their spirits today yeah and geneng G
3:48:51
also now on a lost streak of one which is actually very significant for Gen
3:48:56
when is that a streak um yeah they've just started it you know I'm on a one so
3:49:02
you're predicting Dean to win this one they on a one loss streak if it goes Fair there'll be a two loss streak you know so we'll talk about streaks a
3:49:09
little bit later Hunan is in the starting lineup here and he is of the
3:49:16
2004 class so he's not quite the the baby like 2007 just came out of
3:49:21
Challengers but I will say that when he first entered Challengers we were like oh this he's oh no this is really
3:49:27
struggling and then he rose so quickly this guy is great we'll see what he has we have the interview ready with him
3:49:33
right now let's jump into that to listen in
3:49:46
[Music]
3:50:08
[Music]
3:50:13
standing
3:50:32
there is the man the myth the legend pan and he is just another one of these
3:50:37
Challenger players that is getting a chance to play during the lck cup a lot of different teams are experimenting
3:50:44
trying different things Bulldog he's here I saw him will he play later I'm
3:50:50
not so sure maybe they get p a full series against gen I will say it's a pretty tough opponent to have your first
3:50:55
lck match be against chovi yeah yeah I mean chovi didn't have
3:51:02
the best performance in the last series against bro but closer I I feel like again was has been playing pretty
3:51:08
fantastically even when bro in the losses he had some pretty Stand Out games so I think some team
3:51:15
against gen G just because if there's a big enough gap between your midlaners you just lose by default it's a an issue
3:51:22
that teams have struggled for a long time to overcome you need a good mid they be in good form so a big ask for a
3:51:28
rookie but uh I guess this is just a trial by fire there was a sign that was like well this sign is very interesting
3:51:34
as well um this is this is a banger
3:51:41
actually I wanted to talk about a different Simer than I saw that one man that's that's Peak that's actually jeni
3:51:47
never cry the context is from a a web comic um and you know where a newborn
3:51:54
baby the mom says uh Queens Never Cry yeah for those who don't know uh but yeah than I'm glad that we have you here
3:52:00
cuz I would have never ever in a million years have been able to link those two together but I'm there across the Gap
3:52:07
also for people who don't know the meme right not everyone's terally online
3:52:12
like yeah there yeah I'm online but then there's there's you um I'm plugged in he
3:52:19
is at all times I'm surprised you don't have like a laptop and like an iPad and you know like multiple different
3:52:25
monitors going on while you're at work like one of those harnesses and you you just jumped on you like a whole desktop
3:52:31
it's funny too because you only have a laptop at this point in time in Korea as well it's like maybe it's cuz you can be
3:52:36
mobile then you know on the Move yeah and well not for long Brandon not for
3:52:42
long but you know upgrades are coming every body has you know when they first come to Korea you you have your like starter your starter thing generally
3:52:49
it's a laptop yeah I didn't have anything I just what did you do I just flew over
3:52:56
um I was working at a company guy with your hands in so I was working at a company I did have a laptop it was very
3:53:02
old so I couldn't really play games but I was working at a company and I used their computer to play to play league okay okay for a second I thought you
3:53:08
were like oh no I spent months of my life not being able to play games no no that that would never happen
3:53:15
we do have a match here on our hands we're highlighting uh all the players and the coaches you guys should all know
3:53:20
them here and you know I think geni coming off of that big upset against bro
3:53:28
they're still smiling they get side selection as well I don't think we should expect like a huge downfall of
3:53:34
geni if anything as production has said it's angry genen now so maybe they come out with that extra fire that extra bit
3:53:40
of realization like oh you know we can lose to anyone we really got got to try our hardest here against the Ines and
3:53:48
that might just happen Maj Le get the varus ban coming out nly lot of big
3:53:54
respect batting the nley against Canyon but that's not Scana which is going to come through
3:54:00
right now right okay well that's cl cl is also a really good ban which means
3:54:07
scner is going to come through yeah don't worry it's coming through
3:54:13
right now now now now now there we go oh you got
3:54:19
it there on like the seventh one you did it nailed it uh kante though ke Sante
3:54:25
yeah that's that's a problem I feel this is a problem with playing red side is like you know for those who don't know
3:54:31
34 scarner bands 33 cler bands so far in the LK cup next most is Vi at 20 those
3:54:37
two are like the locked in bands at the moment and then you're like well you want to ban Canyons n and then you got
3:54:43
to banss uh why red side is such a big bit no uh no to's like I can fix him no
3:54:50
you can't you can't fix him no tovy don't do it his coach is telling him no
3:54:56
no no it's 012 don't do it Y is up I'm buil different I'm build different the
3:55:02
whole crowd let out a giant groan and it's okay it's 8 carry it's 8 carry it's
3:55:09
up against oh that's chy was saying I ain't playing that give it a ruler
3:55:14
brother is like I can play anything if it's a need carry double and give it to the next guy I mean to be fair you know
3:55:21
I think was it what did was saying that he thinks it's a lot better in the bot Lane um a lot more you can do with pressure from the pick that was what I
3:55:27
did yeah so maybe feeling a little bit better about this could this be cor's first win in the lck cup it could be and
3:55:36
also you know you are used to seeing Cori vers here so many times genz are
3:55:41
like we have Cante we have Cori and AIA They're bringing back all the lck
3:55:46
favorites all the Champions you love to see all right what's next Lami in the B
3:55:53
well they already have Cori I guess they put Cory jungle Lami the jungle's got to be like UD Heim or like Sani you me you
3:56:02
mean the bot l oh that would hit all the Bas that would literally nail everything
3:56:08
uh people don't want to see but so pan gave up the the secret information he
3:56:13
likes to play control Mages funnily enough he called it a standing Mage which I guess makes sense you know you don't have a lot of um well I know
3:56:20
stands up Victor who's open so that's what I was thinking yeah he does stand I
3:56:26
don't think you really need to ban Oriana even though pukan is a big Oriana enjoyer yeah definitely they it that's
3:56:36
you know fair play um they denied his a they ban his Oriana I think the Victor angle makes a lot of sense in this
3:56:42
situation yeah uh it looks like they will just lock that in everything's playing out according to plan outside of
3:56:50
I guess the Corky there it is and Victor can
3:56:56
struggle into his ear especially if you put a lot of pressure into the mid lane and you force flashes and you make them
3:57:01
vulnerable to Zer alt so certainly pan is going to have to play a clean game of
3:57:06
League of Legend which we can't always say about our rookies being able to do yeah they went heavy on the jungle bands
3:57:12
here but it has meant like raan is open uh which we often see into Brom very
3:57:17
hard for Brom to do much against raan because you know it takes so long to stack up your passive he can just dash
3:57:23
out again against that but it is raan noia uh toying with the idea off of Zach
3:57:30
which also I'm be honest you have two immobile carries in the Ash and the Victor no way of stopping them really
3:57:35
other than the braw M which isn't super ideal I actually think the Zach would have made sense the Mastery absolutely
3:57:42
not uh the Le in you know Canyon I I'll allow it but now
3:57:49
uh going to see a poppy in return so perhaps not to be fair if you went Zack and they pick poppy you'd be kind of
3:57:54
cooked anyway so yeah I think with poppy available it's like you kind of have limited options
3:58:02
but poy not even going to be selected and Wukong will be prioritized here by yosik yeah it's been really popular in
3:58:09
Solo que and I feel like the priority in the lck cup has been rising as well of this pick we're seeing more Wukong um a
3:58:15
lot of Team fighting Power uh you know you have I feel like sometimes with the
3:58:21
Brom you can really see a comp struggle with lack of engages you know maybe like the last game we had but here they have
3:58:26
Ash Arrow they have Wukong who can dive in they have n who go Mega and find find access so I I think they have more tools
3:58:33
here and also less like poke from the side of gen compared to what we had in
3:58:38
the last series from D+ so I think both teams have given themselves some decent options I think think uh one thing is
3:58:45
that geni you know raan uh does fine into Ash Brom but maybe like the level one could be a bit precarious so got to
3:58:52
watch out for that uh but some decent comfort for that team but they do have to fight against the immense corki lost
3:58:59
streak and their own yeah singular game singular series L streak singular series
3:59:05
Lost streak uh so there you go the call up of
3:59:10
a rookie for dnf you can't stop that that's what that says I I think it is
3:59:17
possible to stop it but I don't know if corki is the choice but ruler says you
3:59:23
know what hand me the Corky I got this I I'll put an end to the madness of all
3:59:28
the casters and all the fans who just keep seeing corki losing over and over
3:59:34
again I will be the one who breaks the streak we'll see if he can make it happen the's top on of the rift for game
3:59:39
number one [Music]
3:59:52
[Applause] get you know I can't remember precisely
3:59:59
but I'm pretty sure is z was on a big win streak as well um yeah was six games
4:00:05
did he win that game during that uh I want to say no okay so maybe it's
4:00:12
been broken already that was how life Esports game one they selected it against DK and oh yeah yeah yeah yeah so
4:00:19
that win streak is already over it's already cooked um so we don't have the battling win streak what about the Braum
4:00:25
win streak also gone was six and zero now it's six and one true uh and you
4:00:30
know as I said in that series I feel like Braum in the right situation has a ton of value um but in the wrong
4:00:37
situation just doesn't just lacks the tools sometimes you need and a big one is engage which is why often we see this
4:00:44
ash bro not only do you have the powerful level one you have Ash you can get that increased attack speed from the
4:00:50
flurry and stack up your passive but uh also you provide that engage that the
4:00:56
the Brum lacks and they do get information a lot of scouting coming out going to get standard Lanes here which I
4:01:01
think does favor dnf uh the ash B very strong level one and on top of that uh
4:01:07
the Cante fa is a lot better in these swap situations than the Nar who's obviously an easy dive and mini so I
4:01:12
think dnf happy they have matched Lanes here yeah uh a I have a question for you
4:01:18
there is uh I'm going to have to hold that question as the heal is utilized the Sun comes through 12 losses we have
4:01:24
guys such as closer zeka aiming everybody just losing Corky is not
4:01:31
winning in the lck it is the Talk of the Town it's why the chat the chat the
4:01:37
crowd and the chat I guess probably I don't know um did not like the pick when
4:01:42
it was selected uh life TR at level two here you will get it um but ax there's one champion on the rift right now who
4:01:49
is undefeated with a decent amount of games who is it is do you know it
4:01:59
okay I don't think it's Cante no it isn't definitely isn't Cante I'll say it's not like a one zero situation yeah
4:02:07
uh is it Victor it's not Victor is it
4:02:14
oh okay I'm going to I don't think it's Ash I'm pretty sure I've seen Ash lose
4:02:19
okay I think it could be raan is that your final
4:02:24
answer can i ph a friend and I ask the audience chat help don't open Twitch yet
4:02:30
I'll say that uh I don't think we haven't seen that much lein play we' seen a bit it could
4:02:36
be lein is that your final answer no no okay
4:02:42
uh well it's definitely not n it's definitely not Wukong it's not Ash it's not Victor it's not corki it's not raan
4:02:51
it's not air it's not gante so it is wait I said it could be raan so it's
4:02:56
raan or lein yeah have I
4:03:02
seen I think it's Le in Final Answer final answer yes you are correct it is
4:03:07
Le for $500,000 oh my God that's life changing and you could go home or you
4:03:16
could play for $1 million I don't have another question
4:03:21
though I'll take I'll take he'll take the 500,000 yeah thank very much he'll be happy with it yeah yeah so Lon is
4:03:26
four and zero currently in the lck he on I would have taken 500,000 one
4:03:33
like yeah that's about what like 380
4:03:40
USD at this point in time uh I mean the exchange right not the hottest at the moment yeah but
4:03:48
um yeah so some decent trading came out in the bot Lane but nothing really too
4:03:53
big to come away from it uh I think part of it is that like as much as a level one is strong for the as Cory fine in these Early Trades and
4:04:00
raan just you know if you're not really shutting them down level one and getting like a big Advantage there once raan
4:04:07
gets level three there's not much you can do to him he can also like block the Brom q and then Dash away so you can't
4:04:13
Even Stu it so yeah just Turing into kind of a farming situation
4:04:20
uh do you have chy down in CS how is that
4:04:29
happening yeah crazy um Ki not chying yeah don't worry
4:04:35
he'll still somehow end up at like 13 CH per minute late in the game yeah we're going to be like 32 minutes in he's going to be high CS for sure
4:04:43
and besides him it's like at the moment ruler and pan who have the highest CS
4:04:54
also all right he blocked the que not to bring up again but in that quiz I I said Victor but there was that game where
4:04:59
like didn't VI to go like 07 yeah but they won that game oh damn yeah there was a game it was uh
4:05:06
Fisher yeah fish wasn't there another game where went like 07 they didn't win uh I think that was bdd I think that
4:05:14
yeah I think that was the bdd where he had like a great game one game three in the MVP and then the middle one was like zero yeah 0 60 okay so that yeah yeah
4:05:23
yeah good thing that wasn't my final answer right yes yes definitely very
4:05:29
good okay grub started up Canyon's already grabbed one so he's kind of like I'm not that bothered you know he's denied the
4:05:36
contribution to the F of strength but he could go back and get more if he really felt like it you see life has already
4:05:42
moved up jro is moving up the follow uh Rula has priority he could actually come
4:05:48
as well and he could cover midwave and then they all move towards these grubs but it looks like the focus might be on Dragon potentially instead I'll take the
4:05:55
skot for now for sure really just backing he's got 66 CS
4:06:02
seems like he hasn't missed many a Nar into the wall That's
4:06:09
Cante man he's nearly under half Health yeah I mean do is doing a good job of putting on pressure right he's up in CS
4:06:16
he's he's doing his job but you're never getting a kill so that's really the you say that thing we
4:06:24
did have Doran get a solo kill uh n into kante that is true so doesn't mean it's
4:06:31
going to happen it's not impossible though you know yeah if you just don't press your W button when half HP in the
4:06:37
tower and eat a full combo it could happen yeah just play it cleanly just
4:06:46
don't do that is is the takeway that we're going to have canion's also kind of power farming he hasn't really
4:06:53
visited any lanes he got the one grub and the Scuttle crab on the bottom
4:06:59
side this time and he's just been kind of just powering through the jungle yeah this is kind of what my Le's do in uh
4:07:05
solo Q just never a guy yeah in Solo Q this would be like seven kills to zero
4:07:11
for the enemy team yeah but I mean he has now starting the dragon they have
4:07:17
pry on the bot Lanes they can move over we have pry on the mid lane from chovy uh a lot of damage being
4:07:26
done good safety from oh he misses yes no my chy y oh man I thought you were
4:07:33
talking about p and I'm like wait that's fine I mean he's a rookie I'm not going to that Brut probably nervous he's up in
4:07:38
F still look it's okay Au like you don't have to call him out for it he's aead and CS oh Arrow going to come out and
4:07:44
the stun on a Duro but you see that ruler doing a great job of trading back so there's really no extension of the
4:07:50
play it actually does feel good for Genji's bottom line Stacks up the Conqueror and like they do manage to lock down jro a bit but just don't have
4:07:57
the damage to cut through uh they do get benefit in terms of Summoners but I
4:08:02
think R is going to be able to pick up a plate here yeah bottom Lane plate is
4:08:11
down and we're about 10 minutes in in about 9 Minutes in and nothing has
4:08:17
happened Ox yeah but we're still 11 minutes away from the uh latest Fierce
4:08:24
blood that's what you got to remember that's true it was like uh 20 minutes 40
4:08:29
seconds 48 48 yeah I remember cuz I was watching and I uh I put my official prediction in
4:08:35
and I was wrong I remember cuz I was casting I remember cuz chronicler won and he was just so smug about it my just
4:08:44
couldn't stop talking about it the whole day there was a picture in the group chop him being smug oh all right Canyon
4:08:50
is leas in so you know he gets uh thrown into the air by the cyclone and then he just kind of laughs at him yeah and not
4:08:57
ready to play for apart from the Scuttle crab but uh huge yeah well secured by
4:09:04
gen the end freaks will back away on that one obviously know Wukong Al don't really want to go for more just a lot of
4:09:10
back and forth trading in this game no one getting too heated so far which you
4:09:17
know I I I feel like both coms of strong scaling components I don't think DM already upset about this um but also it
4:09:23
kind of part of the course sometimes for Gen just to slowly build up their lead in a game yeah I mean they have good scaling
4:09:30
you know Cante is going to be unkillable later on you've got air and corki who as we know extremely safe you can just sit
4:09:37
back and farm and be happy as the game comes along um obviously the DM freaks have their own share of scaling I feel
4:09:44
like the one thing that I would have liked to see is ji put a bit more pressure on aan like we see this all the
4:09:49
time especially jungler players will be like I'm going to find the rookie and I'm just going to gank him relentlessly
4:09:55
or at least put on pressure or at least kind of show up in his Lane once if you Fe an early Flash from the Victor level
4:10:04
six he's just dead have and AIA so
4:10:09
instead I mean ky's just been running around farming and he's ahead N9 Cs and that's it oh he's got a one gold
4:10:17
Bounty look I he does yes oh it's up to two
4:10:22
gold they found him the flash comes in but Canyon still has flash but now Canyon's in a r spot he's getting first
4:10:28
down it's first blood that goes to pan in his first lck game he just strolls on
4:10:34
in he's like I'm totally fine I'm just going to beat this leasing into death yeah pong super confident turns it
4:10:39
around gets the alop and you know still had that flash available so despite the efforts to get him was able to
4:10:45
reposition and geni do not get the one gold Bounty unfortunately for themselves uh and now DM freaks looking
4:10:54
towards the Gres will'll get one and we'll look for more R and jro just
4:11:00
trying to scare them away but they're not really phased too heavily D do TP
4:11:06
so that rocket almost stole it by the way that second one ruler TPS or not
4:11:11
ruler Doo TPS and pan now has to run down a bottom Lane but this is a second plate oh we have the eclipse de in as
4:11:18
well Canyon wants to pump some
4:11:24
damage could this be could this be the 013 cor key what are we thinking I mean
4:11:30
I said at the beginning of the day or at the beginning of this series at least that you know gen they're going to come
4:11:35
back they're going to be angry but so far what I'm seeing is actually just more passivity I mean they they went for
4:11:41
this play sure I think the problem was is that like Canyon got the kick out the shuffle but like chy already used all of
4:11:50
his cool Downs there wasn't anything anything else like having a third person there would have made a big difference but just the Flash and the fact that the
4:11:55
rest of the team were there to peel just a bit of an
4:12:01
overstep we know gen are still a good team they have a very strong roster and they were able to take down H ESP sports
4:12:07
but that series from Hama as well was extremely weak like we talked about how strong jeni were and they did play it
4:12:13
very well but it was it's it's always two sides to the coin right where it's
4:12:19
like one team performing well the other one maybe not performing well and it leads to a win for the team that's
4:12:24
performing well so gingi they started off very strong but there definitely still could be some you know some issues
4:12:32
within the new roster you know ruler coming back are there too many cooks in the chicken do cook chicken not inside
4:12:40
yeah okay um in the kitchen could be and you know dur are the chickens in the are
4:12:45
they being cooked in the No No they're they're family are they pet the chickens are chefs in the kitchen that sounds
4:12:52
like a good show actually k i I feel like I'd watch that yeah maybe like an
4:12:58
anime animated series no I want it live action I want real life chickens I want
4:13:04
them to train the chickens to yeah I mean that that sounds pretty difficult so I don't know that's why I said
4:13:10
anime all right flash away buddy you're against raan you're not getting away and
4:13:15
down he goes this dive is morave a let's kill the turret as soon as we possibly can and they will be able to do that
4:13:22
Cante eventually should die right Keen Sante not going to hit the Q3 on a life
4:13:28
who just Dodges it and there you go they get the turret the first Blood turret
4:13:34
and the kill yep Supreme confidence there from life just able to dodge everything away they get the pat of
4:13:39
strength off the back of that turret and just a great call realizing that Cante is just one of those Champions
4:13:46
where you kill the turret and then deal with him after because he's a pain uh with all the CC he has in the kit we'll
4:13:54
see replay this in the bot Lane CC lay really well he's about to hit Mega and I they give him the window that's why he flashed obviously to try and get that
4:14:00
window but they just don't give him the opportunity great layering of CC H this one a little bit harder you know ke's
4:14:05
getting scary and they just go hey guys let's just kill the power yeah just watch life and how he
4:14:12
dodges this at the end that's the coolest part the Q3 just jumps on over
4:14:17
yeah very good position really well played and Z just pumping in the damage you know lethal Tempo uh with the flurry
4:14:24
as well able to shred through Keen despite how tanky he is yeah still have
4:14:31
geni in a lead uh they did not get first blood they did not get first turret yet
4:14:38
they have more gold and more dragons well that's cuz than freaks Canyon's 20
4:14:43
CS up and ruler's 20 CS up and they got more plates 10 CS up and they got plates
4:14:49
yeah um so you know they have the advantages but I think DM freak's pretty
4:14:55
happy with how things have panned out so far see theak is going to spawn on the bottom side of the map and it is ocean
4:15:04
soul um may or may not come into play the ocean Drake depending on the timing
4:15:10
you know maybe if gen can like knock down one or it's not really going to
4:15:15
matter like maybe if they want to fight over ocean soul points then you know it leads into an
4:15:20
Aon one way or another seems kind of unlikely yeah it does make things a bit easier 3E 25 minutes cuz you can kind of
4:15:28
just control dragon and the adakan um but it becomes very difficult
4:15:33
when Baron spawns cuz you have two major objectives on opposite sides of the map yeah it's an interesting gang from
4:15:39
piosik where he just walks in a straight line at the enemy and hopes he doesn't see see
4:15:44
me didn't really end up doing much uh but he he's showing presence in the top
4:15:49
side because they want to fight over the rift Herald of course which at the moment Canyon is
4:15:55
trying to deny Berserker he feels the pressure in the 2V1 he will play it safe
4:16:00
because if he goes down it's just free Rift Heralds given over so dnf in
4:16:06
position now to try to go for this both top laners who are in the bottom Lane have their TPS available the unbreakable
4:16:12
use already yeah dud he's stacking up his rage bar could get a TP angle you can
4:16:18
actually see there two Wards uh just past the river onto jji side of the map
4:16:23
but look for in wow the engage on a chi he gets the Divide off though and I mean
4:16:30
at least they get his flash trade of a couple of their flashes for chovy's Flash yeah and I think that signal not
4:16:37
to go for the fight Dudu has had his Mega proed he's about to be exhausted you've been all your big tools and didn't find anything
4:16:44
D Coming Back wants the TP wants some help P nearby as well keante kind of
4:16:49
missing a lot the Q3 as well not going to land here Dudu just gets out and a ton of damage comes out from pan and
4:16:56
posi and so it is traded back but at least the rift Herald will go to the uh
4:17:03
farming Canyon who does pick up another objective but this turret also going to
4:17:08
go the way of DN yeah feels like Keen missing more skull shots when we take typically expect of him on a champion he
4:17:15
has been so proficient with uh and yeah I think DM freaks this is the right call you go bot you get a kill you get a
4:17:21
tower uh Harold normally gives a tower in most situations so I I think it's a
4:17:26
decent trade obviously J get to choose which Tower they take probably go for Mid but yeah I mean the AL comes out uh
4:17:32
D go mini But ultimately when he miss his Q3 the Q3 yeah yeah could have killed
4:17:40
him uh if being completely honest because if he hits the first Q3 he SS him towards the turret as well which
4:17:47
maybe gets him closer to ghost or something but like you're just missing so much damage in your combos if you're
4:17:52
just not hitting anything yeah generally abilities do a lot less damage when you miss them yeah significantly generally
4:17:59
unless you're playing like uh I don't think there's a champ in the
4:18:04
game where you do more damage from so what if you're like playing Ari with uh
4:18:09
malignants and you Alt you're still going to do more damage if you hit your abilities you put I'm just
4:18:16
saying that it still it can do damage even if you miss just what I was saying I mean with
4:18:24
malignance you still have to hit them with unability you know oh they actually man to defend
4:18:29
pretty well there yeah uh dragon is alive turret's barely alive now they're
4:18:36
pushing into the river Still Standing what doesn't kly makes stronger gen on
4:18:41
the dragon ocean points I said they wouldn't fight over it they're all going all in posik knocking up everybody but
4:18:48
he's super low and kasak in the backline is totally fine but Dudu just got here and now it's a 5v5 but everybody on the
4:18:54
side the kick is massive from Canyon but it might not matter Dudu in that back
4:19:00
line not able to quite do enough damage but pan as well still alive full health but he doesn't have a front line anymore
4:19:07
the knockup comes in and pan so sad for him he gets knocked down and the
4:19:13
shutdown goes over to the corki as well gen barely pull ahead and take that fight the rookie the last one to fall
4:19:19
felt like he was doing everything he could to keep the fight going but gen just had some crisp execution here so
4:19:25
first off you look at Duro waiting over the wall for bios's engage to immediately CC him but he buys so much
4:19:32
time the healing that comes out thanks to life gets an AO on to ke for some extra health and the the Arcane storm
4:19:38
doing so much work getting tons of damage kicked in flashes out before the followup
4:19:45
CC does manage to survive but only for keing to take him out and then it's just
4:19:50
Kung Yong just trying to do what he can but he just doesn't quite have the damage yet that L unfortunately misses but even if a hit low health bars but
4:19:57
not low enough they put so much damage into Cante and rakan and especially
4:20:04
between rakan Cante and lein so much shielding being thrown around like you don't think of these Champions as like
4:20:11
big shielders not J but over the course of a long fight like that they actually got quite a few
4:20:17
in it's kind of insane I feel like if you're taking out some of the carries dnf had an angle to take that fight down
4:20:25
but that's not the way it played out and we giving Keen some flag from missing some abilities but in that fight he was
4:20:31
able to do so much and stay alive for an incredibly long amount of time so just
4:20:36
some whoopsies but then immediately turns it around when it matters most and ruler you know in the carry position
4:20:43
this corki seems to be fine from ahead he's doing a lot of burst damage he's already got a couple of items as now we
4:20:50
will be fighting over this Aon we got 5v5 but D's less than half Health with no narbar and they're putting themselves
4:20:57
in a position where they cannot Retreat actually so they kind of have to go for the steel piosik trying to get close can
4:21:04
he get in there Canyon getting pretty low himself has to get out but look at Keane just tanking it up and they get
4:21:10
the sweep on aan as well down goes the Victor and Berserker is alone the entire front gine gets shredded by of course
4:21:18
the penta man and it gets by chy the pin of denial happens again he
4:21:26
might be able to get his first win in the lck cup but corki will not get a pen chy says no you know ruler's going to be
4:21:35
upset about that one and here's the sad thing because they got the atamp up he can't even suicide on the tower properly
4:21:41
in protest I was looking on stage you you actually
4:21:46
see big versions of the webcams ch's got a giant smile on his face ruler is very
4:21:53
serious rer takes it seriously he wants his Penta he's playing Corky who's zero
4:21:58
and 12 and he doesn't get a Penta yeah so they try and rout round but it's really hard for piosik to get in because
4:22:04
of keen who's playing bouncer H and so if eventually just has to go for it and ult Keen to try and create some space
4:22:12
but you see just hyong is like trying to find an angle to get damage down but gets swept up by chobi he's instantly
4:22:18
deleted Yoshi got caught the charm as well and they just move through the fight the fact that they pick up the
4:22:23
atakan as well no chance for losing his
4:22:33
P talking about
4:22:39
the take it slow
4:22:51
said you want to die and he wanted uh he wanted him to
4:22:57
give it so a lot of discussion obviously
4:23:04
about the pent situation ruler was not happy I think at this point of the game there's going to be more discussion about that uh than actually playing out
4:23:11
the game I think geni got this one pretty un lock but uh no pent uh for ruler in this one unless something crazy
4:23:18
happens from here on out oh that Arrow jeez I mean they have
4:23:24
a ofon buff so doesn't matter um just sending it and there you go nice little
4:23:30
sweep catches a very juicy Target the ass will go down and that is a couple
4:23:36
for the Corky once again ruler up to 7 and zero and he could have even more kills
4:23:43
if we didn't get so many assists as well yeah carries oh man 84 maybe you know yeah
4:23:51
like that specific one extra kill 806 there you go he could have been
4:23:57
905 that one specific extra kill I think the one I'm talking about this game has totally falling apart I mean just two
4:24:04
gigantic team fights the one that led to Genji getting position on Aon and then of course the Aon fight a huge
4:24:11
difference in terms of levels and the jungle I guess all that farming from the side of Canyon has paid off by the end of it all and obviously uh the big team
4:24:18
fights and the objectives so there you go Gen kind of
4:24:23
an unusable spot now almost 14,000 gold ahead yeah chy with some slick moves
4:24:31
here and second fight in a row where he's just picked one of these Mobile carries and said you're
4:24:37
mine a fantastic job of it uh and obviously with theam buff just get a free recoil it's not easy he tp's
4:24:45
in and Canyon's like well I've been so much damage he's to levels up on the mid
4:24:53
laner they're just that far ahead power far Le in goes hard uh but yeah it seems really cooked
4:25:00
at this point I think you know DM freaks they kept it relatively close throughout the game but I think the problem with
4:25:06
playing against gen is that it's close until it isn't and the team fighting is so crisp generally speaking cheing um
4:25:14
that they will just pick you apart and they don't mind if the game is slower paced they will find Windows to push the
4:25:20
face forwards but they're good at controlling and just building up a gold lead gradually for themselves and then pouncing when the time is right and I
4:25:27
think DM fre really fell into that trap yeah and now with the deficit they they are really going to struggle to do
4:25:33
anything look at the items between 80 carries like I didn't really want to but
4:25:39
now now you forced me to it's pretty absurd basically two items Vamp
4:25:46
sceptor joke now it would be really crazy if Cori was lose from here that's
4:25:51
all I'm saying yeah you know I don't think it's going to happen Dan I I think they got this one actually uh the damage
4:25:58
from ruler alone is enough and P's like well maybe no never mind they have Cante
4:26:05
as well um ocean St Cante as well as if he with with spare
4:26:10
Vis as if he wasn't unkillable enough already abely
4:26:17
unkillable and you know it really just shows you the strength of bro as well the fact that they were able to take
4:26:22
down a team this strong dnf and bro same score line one and two but bro are just
4:26:28
built different that's what the BRX pays for y and this game looks like it's a
4:26:34
totally different tier like geni actually playing to a top level TM
4:26:40
freaks they were competing while nothing was happening um they just can't to anything
4:26:48
you have no op I don't oh by the way apparently chy also said I thought lein got a kill so he thought that it wasn't
4:26:55
a Penta angle that's why he was saying it's not a Penta it's not a Penta that's a good cover that's that's fantastic
4:27:01
excuse choby uh wow nice engage here from Duro going to catch both carries at
4:27:07
the same time forcing both the flashes obviously it doesn't matter all too much that's a nice little Whip and as they
4:27:12
are certainly playing with their food here at the end of the game gen are so insanely
4:27:19
ahead cover your eyes oh it's not safe and they got the kill at the end as well
4:27:25
it's like 20,000 gold ahead Jen just destroy them yeah not the
4:27:32
cleanest uh kick at the end from Canyon uh but generally solid game from uh geni
4:27:38
they will break the Cory lost streak and uh yeah so you know the kill feed it came up that LE killed arakan so chovi
4:27:46
thought that that was a kill and so that was the cover he used so he could steal
4:27:52
the penter that's angry ruler right there doing the showmaker that's how he
4:27:57
feels right now on the inside the coach like good job guys we won let's have a little he just just
4:28:04
smoldering I to like laughing oh toia was laughing like patting him on the
4:28:10
shoulder and stuff and rer was just like like totally ignoring him that the perfect moment to say it's okay little
4:28:17
bro yeah uh I mean this gold graph says it all you know it was just steady
4:28:23
building up some Farm differences DM freaks even felt like they got some advantages and then one fight lost and the game is just over within a span of
4:28:30
10 minutes it was one of those games couple of Team fights into you're just that far
4:28:37
ahead and Aon certainly helped out with that as well the LC
4:28:42
tigers do not die it says geni fighting and they pick up the first win of the series we'll see what happens next after
4:28:49
the break

we had some great content there during the break and some great content when we listened in to jeng's Victory here in
4:36:17
game number one as ruler almost had a pentac kill stolen away we'll cover that
4:36:23
and more welcome back to the space deonal lside chronicler and wolf after that very very slow start to this game
4:36:32
to the point where it led to uh M quizmaster Valdez having to create some
4:36:37
stuff that was that was a very slow early a very slow quiz as well I was kind of hoping they were going to get to the answer a little bit faster he gave
4:36:44
Ox like I don't know 10 minutes to figure it out um I actually I actually love the build up I thought it was very
4:36:49
dramatic and also the game had nothing going on to me the big standout for this game the whole feeling about is like
4:36:55
yeah it had a really dramatic ending right near pentakill gingi looked dominant if you just like start watching
4:37:01
from 20 minutes on but the start wasn't clean and I'm starting to get a little bit concerned that jeni you know
4:37:07
especially with top teams like D+ at the top might not be the best team we have right now in lck cup I think there's a
4:37:13
lot of jelling that still needs to be done the early game was a little bit messy Canyon for the big kick play in
4:37:19
the mid lane and ended up dying and they gave First Blood over jeni really need to tighten up some of their play cuz
4:37:24
it's a very snowballing meta often times right now and they ended up winning in the end cuz they were the stronger team but this is a little bit concerning you
4:37:32
know we saw the graph at the post game and there was no change in the gold lead
4:37:39
until this moment highlight number one at 9 15 minutes we finally get someone who takes the lead in terms of gold and
4:37:45
it was all due the back of Canyon and the previous game really feel like it was on a tight rope this game was just
4:37:53
it was just a rope it wasn't tight there was nothing happening and then fortunately here Canyon even as low as
4:37:59
he is actually goes absolutely Mega gets a Freeman kick while also taking out the
4:38:05
biggest threat and this is really what kind of wins the game and it's it's crazy that a game between a dnf that
4:38:14
sure has I think some good players and I could see become a full on team as as
4:38:19
the year progresses but geneng G is coming off of a summer that was
4:38:24
completely out of this world and I know that obviously did change the bot Lane but neither Canyon nor chovi I have seen
4:38:31
in the form that they need to be do does this team want to kind of reide what happened last year yeah but we saw that
4:38:37
kick play there the dragon as kind of one of those glimpses into the clutch that we know can Canon still has it's
4:38:43
just the consistency the early passing the early impact that we're not seeing from Toby XA um and then also just Canyon's
4:38:51
uh early attempts to to make plays haven't been as crisp as we like to see from because he hold them at a really
4:38:56
high standard it's Canyon you know world's MVP yeah but from there jeni did know how to accelerate the game 2
4:39:02
minutes later huge huge fight on the bottom side of the map which then leads to the moment we're thinking all right
4:39:08
here's the geni penta ruler welcome back and uh uh was a chovi had a huge huge
4:39:15
grin on his face in the player cam as it was later explained chovi saw the kill
4:39:20
that Canyon got on Aon and thought that that man that Lee got a kill like in the
4:39:26
in the ticker which is why he didn't give the kill over uh he afterwards apologized one right there genuinely
4:39:32
yeah that that's the one that threw him off uh so I'm sure ruler will in due time forgive him what it important to
4:39:38
show here is that that is what I want to see of gen right and I think we're not going to go too crazy this is LK Cup
4:39:45
teams have plenty of time to fix their issues uh as we've seen last year even your Performance in Spring and Summer
4:39:50
doesn't mean anything because when you get to the big tournaments that when you need to step up which ji did at MSI
4:39:55
obviously not so much at Worlds and the reason why we're talking about it already when we're in January is just
4:40:01
because it's geni and naturally with players like chovi and Kan that's what we're going to gravitate towards yeah I
4:40:06
think that geni was known for snowballing games incredibly well um and
4:40:11
also for great team fighting in even game States but most of their games weren't very even cuz they usually crushed early and then exploded those
4:40:18
gold leads into the mid game these games recently haven't felt as much like the old gingi little bit of a new identity
4:40:23
for this team and I I still think they're figuring it out well just like Brion Bros were able to break a
4:40:31
streak against jeni ji breaking a streak here now corki the meme is over corki
4:40:38
gets himself the first victory in the LC K cup geni up 10 Z will they be able to
4:40:44
close it out here will the DN freaks have something to say about it let's send it over to the guys that have something to say about the match the
4:40:50
casters thank you spacers we do have something to say about the
4:40:55
match we'll let you know what that is in just a little bit I was going to say corki is now on a win streak of one I
4:41:04
was going to say corki is still a meme because he's 1 and 12 yeah yeah nothing so hard still a
4:41:09
meme and still bad although ruler can make it work if you have eight kills
4:41:16
does a lot of damage it does yes it you have four items when the enemy ad Carry
4:41:22
has two it's pretty good do you know what else is pretty good in that situation anvia 80 carry you have double
4:41:29
the items with the Enemy carry no it's not as bad as Nivia 8 carry um but it's
4:41:35
close I didn't say that I didn't say that I mean to be fair you know I spoke to w a lot about this NE but like the
4:41:40
power offer in the bot Lane was better used than the power off in the mid lane um and it did win in the bot Lane so
4:41:47
very safe won the lane kind of I mean they didn't fight at all they also kind of
4:41:52
pick support um and yeah yeah did have just didn't really do all together that
4:41:59
much for a lot of the game but now on blue side uh and gen has to ban scarner
4:42:07
and likely kalist so DM freaks get the that bands
4:42:12
back there we go VI ban from them as
4:42:19
well uh they banned it on blue side last time yeah maybe ban the varus uh for
4:42:26
geni for the freaks they're going to find the rumble I mean Ash is taken away so I
4:42:33
think vars really stands out as being like the premier bot L right now I think I'd probably ban
4:42:39
it uh otherwise it is going to get stopped up immediately I mean rer played Corky into
4:42:46
Ash and won so but no it it is going to be the
4:42:51
virus that is taken off the board that does leave VI available available and VI AA viable yeah a viable andessa also a
4:43:01
viable yes um yeah so good just pick that one up no Sant on the cards as well we'
4:43:08
often see matched into it no Jace either top pool kind of thinned out so this this face pick actually gets a lot more
4:43:14
power is that because the top pool has like four champions in it yes very thinned out so far yeah you remove the
4:43:21
ones that everyone wants to play and then I mean there's still stuff like Jax yeah and
4:43:27
Renekton and Jax and Renekton Aurora yeah that's too
4:43:34
I mean Keen was I think our first to play aora Top Lane uh very quick poppy
4:43:39
Pig which is a flex could be spat could be jungle could be top so keeping the options open um if it
4:43:48
is top I think that makes sense if you just want to match it um you know fake that you have some flexibility but also
4:43:54
good at shutting down the dashes but I I feel like picking it this early in another wall is a little bit questionable they instantly reveal it's
4:44:00
not going jungle with a VI pickup uh and now for DM freaks to
4:44:06
answer it's a little bit tricky cuz you know in the poppy you don't want to pick too many chance dashes into VI you don't
4:44:12
want to pick too many stationary jumps um so yeah you're probably going
4:44:17
to end up picking stuff that has Mobility but it's not necessarily like uh you could think
4:44:23
about something like an Ezreal could maybe could be uh prioritized for Berserker instead thinking about mid
4:44:30
jungle they want to get the top of the map first I like the tiia honestly into the vi into the poppy yeah uh can really
4:44:36
shut them down quite heavily if it does end up being a poppy support especially you know we saw earlier uh a game where
4:44:42
there just wasn't quite enough engageed tools into AER and it was a bit of a struggle Aurora also
4:44:48
strong um by the way y also available just
4:44:53
wanted to throw it out there no going with the changing mind every two seconds so I think Aurora just left specifically
4:44:59
shut down Poppy and V but just a lot of power in the team fighting the ult as
4:45:04
well uh now geni if they want to match up to that mid I think it would make a decent amount of sense they wanted to go
4:45:11
with the Yi but they you know with the ad jungle maybe want to lean more towards an AP mid especially since like
4:45:17
rumble's taking off the cards in the Top Lane so you can't just pick up AP there uh and Gallo I think Gallo
4:45:24
VI you know I feel like you do this and use Bania immediately um is what I would
4:45:29
do unless you plan to pick it yourselves because you know if you can't play a champion you can literally fly up
4:45:36
in the air and avoid a vial you're going to get smooshed it's true there you and there
4:45:42
it is uh it turns out that Ox in fact is coaching from the Caster
4:45:48
desk sent a quick message to coach Kim he's like you know what I think probably
4:45:53
go ahead and ban theah yeah coach Kim's like I agree really difficult to work out though that one hey guys we're
4:46:00
playing engage Champions maybe just ban the champion who can like Dodge vile do
4:46:05
you think uh Israel deserves a ban or do you think they can extend for that uh
4:46:11
uh I think it's probably a safe ban probably a decent one um I like the Jinx
4:46:17
ban coming out from DM freaks especially when you have like this this diving composition you're lacking damage a bit
4:46:22
in the mid lane it might end up being the poppy top I think having a Resa Champion like Jinx can go a long way in
4:46:28
terms of making the fight go faster I think DM freaks could also ban like the Kaiser MF is a bit weird to me I feel
4:46:35
like got the vi I mean in What scenario is MF pretty old but I don't know um
4:46:43
yeah I think maybe like a Kaiser ban could have value here um kind of fits on theme with what ji's composition wants
4:46:50
to do uh we'll
4:46:55
see yeah the MF I I'm not a big fan of myself but maybe you know laning thing
4:47:00
it could be as well if you don't want to deal with that it feels like MF is very safe in general not against what they
4:47:07
have as you were mentioning now the Leon also taken off the board but Ezreal
4:47:12
available and there's not that many great ID carries outside of the kaisa
4:47:19
you know I feel like kaisa into this obviously people like clicking her into Ezreal cuz you can dive onto him um you
4:47:24
don't have like the best setup you definitely need engage support here and there's tools to disengage it like this poppy could have to go and support to
4:47:30
mitigate it what I will say is that if you do get rolling on the Kaiser you're one of the 80 carriers who feel best
4:47:37
about buying AAS um so you do have that in your pocket uh but definitely you know both teams so
4:47:43
far I mean it felt like there was this dive oriented play from gen but now DM freaks have really Le that way as well
4:47:49
it just kill the enemy team's backline um and it like G wins gallo and
4:47:56
Poppy wins that 100% of the time my concern is that geneng g kind of really only have one damage thre so if I mean
4:48:03
it's a big H but if ruler dies what is left in terms of like carrying the the damage to the fight
4:48:09
it's like a it's a very low damage composition you have things like aora ult you have a kaisa and a n like nless
4:48:16
presses are and ezal and kaisa ults in and rora o on top it it's hard to
4:48:21
outplay that and then you're just left with a bunch of tanks and bruises so
4:48:26
little bit consider it won't be a problem if Genji get ahead ezal super strong in the mid game a lot of the other Champions will still be doing a
4:48:32
lot of damage there but if it goes late if Genji has any fums I I I really think that composition could end up lacking in
4:48:38
the damage department they do have a lot of Peel though and it is an AS it's not like it's not going to be that hard to
4:48:43
defend ruler um but a lot of this game rests on his shoulders I feel yeah
4:48:49
absolutely a lot of berserker fans in the audience you can see a really cool drawing up at the top right as well that says swag or just swo and then a
4:49:00
separately um happy jeni family that's what looks like when he
4:49:06
stole the pen yeah well this C certainly has ways to
4:49:12
dive into the backline and acquire Targets this one has ways to prevent that and also to dive and engage should
4:49:20
be a pretty interesting match between these two going into game two can geni have a clean series let's find out as we
4:49:27
hop on the rip for game two
4:49:36
[Applause]
4:49:47
all righty here we go game number two and already we are invading this is all
4:49:54
spotted by life who spots them going in and that's going to mean that Berserker can get in get a ward
4:50:00
down and so can uh poosi and
4:50:06
dooo it's a bit of a split map at the moment
4:50:14
H keep put a w down isn't repeting to top
4:50:22
though can I keep the options open oh life's going to face check well it helps
4:50:29
when you're face checking and the guy just runs out of the Bush it does help yeah you're like oh you were in the bush
4:50:35
I had no idea the INF are kind of figure out what they're doing but no one's already shown um they don't know who is
4:50:41
on this bot side oh keen's got to stun yeah that's the stun the followup
4:50:47
here yeah they don't already kill him they just kind of annoying him I mean they chunk him out so it's
4:50:54
it's not too bad and they kind of deny him access to Lane it's a very weird arrangement I
4:51:01
mean we've seen games like this before yeah um where like the top laner stays bot for like an extended aggressive play
4:51:09
and they kind of just T you back top and they kind of sacrifice a lot for it but it's a snowball the bot Lane seen this before on things
4:51:15
likeon uh not really so much here it does give a little bit of an advantage to ruler and dururo in the 2v2 they got
4:51:20
the lane first life was a bit late H and EZ already notoriously good level
4:51:25
one but in the counter point is put Keen behind and he has no TV in the Top Lane
4:51:32
so I think what's important though is that bazer and life get level two before this wave
4:51:38
crashes it would be a hard dive to do so I'm not sure that really Genji goes for
4:51:43
it uh I don't think they will to be honest I think they're probably fine poppy in the Top Lane you know Keen
4:51:50
had to have his fun he got to have his fun with Keen Sante and now he has to play Poppy and ambessa it's uh I
4:51:56
remember from the season opening event he was like complaining about playing boring stuff but it's like bro you
4:52:03
kicked he was complaining about the match up cuz it was like tank vs tank I was like yeah come on you could have
4:52:09
picked not anything else yeah well maybe not so I
4:52:14
have limited sympathy if you enjoy tanks that's fine okay some people just that's how they are but um you can't then
4:52:21
complain about it yeah it was a fun event by the way we we
4:52:27
had a lot of fun in season opening events H out of midair and protection on the que life
4:52:33
goated yep doing a good job mitigating the pressure um they are still down a b in farm kind of expected from the start
4:52:44
and it definitely feels like they have the pressure here uh yeah I mean this is kind of the trade-off uh how much value
4:52:51
are you getting from this bot Lane little advantage that Keen gave over in return from besta having a bit more free
4:52:56
time top sounded like you said
4:53:02
Bessa that's what a friends coer like that's her nickname or something I just removed the M yeah I
4:53:10
mean like I don't think anyone would call her nicknames after you know the
4:53:16
way she was an Arcane she was very Fierce yes strict I didn't see season 2
4:53:22
yet un fortunately she was in season 1 you she was right I did see season one
4:53:28
yeah yeah we didn't watch season 2 yet you know I saw some fans being critical of lck casters not watching the show
4:53:35
about the game cast lacking the law knowledge yeah sorry about that yeah
4:53:40
kind of shameful were you doing anything around the time it came out any excuses you know a child of something would be a
4:53:47
good excuse at the hospital for some reason I can't quite remember though yeah yeah well huh I guess we'll allow
4:53:55
maybe it'll come back to me eventually just remember a lot of crying and you
4:54:02
know same with arane season 2 taking care of
4:54:08
something yeah well we're chilling out again do we know
4:54:14
what was the first blood in that last game it wasn't a it was the one where they play no it was one where they were
4:54:20
went mid and it was like the shuffle into the leasing kick ah yeah it wasn't
4:54:25
first blood for pan just to then immediately in every fight afterwards just die unceremoniously well no he had
4:54:32
that first fight around Dragon where he actually played it really well and then get touched and then he just kept getting shuffled by chovi chovy put him
4:54:39
on his list he died in that fight as well at the end yeah but you you didn't die
4:54:45
unceremoniously you know I think you put up a good fight I mean he was a Victor with like one item and he was like doing
4:54:51
tickle damage he was doing his job he was get he's pumping that he just you know Tu some time he had a good ult it's
4:54:57
just difficult right and then chovi just put him on his
4:55:02
list that did happen that did absolutely happen and now we've seen Swap come through uh didn't freaks putting some
4:55:10
some pressure towards the grub so should be able to secure those but it does mean dud is isolate you just have ult and
4:55:15
life is coming to give him life hope yeah he's on the way I mean this Gallo
4:55:22
might make things even more difficult so yeah they just have to back away from
4:55:28
this they actually can't even stand near and if you take a look at the Top Lane Keen is just playing against only kaisa so Jen are winning here denying all the
4:55:35
farm getting plates I mean as soon as Gallo shows I think you you just run the tower I think you can make it yeah
4:55:42
they're backing off I think if it's like Gallo as well they can 4v2 you between the towers but once you see Gallo it's
4:55:47
like okay we have enough CC we can make our way over you know they're tankier characters as well they're not squishies
4:55:53
but still positive play for Gen I would say forcing away uh in terms of the gold
4:55:59
around that one they did also get the dragon so despite the fact those three grubs went to DM freaks still even in
4:56:05
terms of those objectives the feat of strength yeah one a piece infernal Drake
4:56:13
exactly even on the gold it was there for okay we're back again we're back it's even need some
4:56:21
gold watching geni took the lead there for like a split second there's wave coming in that's
4:56:27
wind they were very far ahead in that in that first game by the end ofes yeah it
4:56:33
just it kind of exploded out of certain point it really did I I mean it it was
4:56:41
very oppressive they were getting all the Drakes they're getting the Drakes again with that first infernal we've had
4:56:49
a lot of mountain today a lot of ocean couple of souls a piece going what do
4:56:54
you feel of this game what you thinking what are you vibing with why does chemtech not exist anymore I'm doing my
4:57:01
best okay I feel like we haven't even seen like an individual chemtech Drake
4:57:08
it's for the best in a while don't question it just accept it I just want to know you don't want to know well
4:57:16
we're we're cooking the tank G yeah I mean it's a decent trade you know chovi
4:57:21
gets chunked out take off his magic damage Shield he's out of Mana
4:57:28
um King caught up in CS too you know he had some kind of free time against kaisa
4:57:33
in the Top Lane yeah I think that's really cuz we already saw a CS lead between the 8 carries and it has
4:57:38
expanded a little but most the Top Lane being cleared up was the big take away from that play ji made towards the BS side now Canya is fishing for
4:57:46
Dudu uh and if he ends up getting Ed like next to that wall he is just
4:57:51
dead instead he's just going to
4:57:56
back deny us some more action just recall simulator you know
4:58:02
yeah that's sometimes how it goes I mean the main thing is the ruler's ahead you know I kind of talked about it coming
4:58:08
out the draft but ruler really needs to be the driving force this game he is a lot of their
4:58:13
damage um and typically he's pretty good at dealing damage not again pent though
4:58:19
he struggled with that a little bit last game he's like the penta King of the lck
4:58:24
not since he came back hasn't got a single one the alate cup that's true P6 in a lot of trouble here I think he
4:58:30
might just die does he even bother to flash nope he doesn't First Blood Duro
4:58:35
picks up it's kind of weird because the you know the the gusts of wind from
4:58:40
Gallo they landed right as he died but still it went over to Duro might op but
4:58:46
um I feel like just called wandering in the jungle that is something gen has with this compatibility just to find
4:58:52
these kind of snap Eng gauges on on Lone targets but also chovi has been spending so much time in the river you see him
4:58:58
doing it again now he'll like push the wave in go on a little walk I think he might actually move down to the bot wave
4:59:04
now but generally he would like push the wave go to walk push the wave go on to walk push the wave go to walk you see him do it so often and and most times it
4:59:11
doesn't really amount to anything but it's pressure it forces the other team to play in a different way we saw that when they were threatening them off the
4:59:17
bot Tower it was only when chovy returned to Mid that they could push up and you get that pryo you have the
4:59:23
opportunity to go for a walk Canyon and durro both here and because chov is coming in you just know it's not even
4:59:30
withth flashing like chovy's walking to cut off if he was going to flash but he holds the Summoner he knows it is pretty
4:59:37
cooked yeah I mean it was just killing a control ward in the dragon pit just
4:59:43
random time no vision over the wall just a little bit of greed I suppose at of pic but it it matters a whole lot
4:59:50
especially it's it's a sort of thing you can do on a champion with Mobility um we just get up the wall not so much on zenz
4:59:58
when you're kind of stuck in the if he was like Wukong maybe Wukong for sure would be fine I think he still would
5:00:03
have died well we have the grubs coming down now Duro going to eat a hook and a tp's coming in so gen say well we got
5:00:09
one so we're just going to run away that does mean there's five grubs to DM
5:00:15
there's a lot we'll see if they can make use of those yeah I mean the thing about wuk is I think you could just taken a different path completely so you
5:00:20
wouldn't have even been exposed yeah but uh yeah so geni just deny them any
5:00:26
contribution towards the Feats and they already have the fierce blood so they already head there uh five grubs we'll
5:00:33
see if they can make use of those cuz right now they're just losing plates on the B side to keen and considering the
5:00:38
start that happened in this game ke like putting Focus towards uh his bot Lane sacrificing himself a little bit he's
5:00:45
now up in farm and taking plates he's chilling he's fine yeah it's just geni slowly tearing
5:00:52
this apart once again but this time in game two it feels even more apparents I feel like you know in game one there was
5:00:58
a lot of back and forth a bit of trading you know it it was kind of like DN
5:01:05
freaks had some angles they were doing pretty well on some of the grub fights and stuff but now it's like kind of
5:01:10
getting everything they didn't get all the grubs obviously D freaks got the five grubs but if you're behind you
5:01:16
don't really get a chance to hit many Tower so it doesn't matter all that much Mountain Soul again yeah CH Tech just
5:01:23
doesn't exist I'm doing my work I'm doing my job uh yeah and they already
5:01:29
have a very tanky composition and if they can get like an early mountaina they will just be a brick wall and I
5:01:35
know I kind of talked about how like later in the game they could struggle in terms of lacking for damage it's going to take a for that ready to come in and
5:01:41
if they're ahead that may just never come in right now ruler's on a pretty good
5:01:47
curve v Gallo still doing lots of damage poppy still doing lots of damage see Keen is actually going for bit more of a
5:01:53
damage build himself not going like full tank yeah I think makes
5:01:59
sense kind of like how Duro is just quite literally running straight at life and denying so many control Wards so
5:02:07
much Vision he's cleared out everything in the bottom jungle and he can do this because he has Gallo
5:02:12
nearby and he's like okay if you really want to collapse on me uh I've got a lot of support I'm r i can hop walls like it
5:02:19
should be totally fine and there's really nothing that life could do about it so he just lost a huge Vision battle
5:02:26
on the bottom side of the map two deep Wards he couldn't even clear out the one that he was trying to clear out because
5:02:31
Duro was still there and yeah it just feels like
5:02:37
there's so much pressure from gen Conant L like you look at the scoreboard the game doesn't look to be in that bad of a
5:02:44
situation at all you know but it just feels like even things like ruler just before
5:02:50
there putting a heavy trade into Dudu and then in the meantime you look top and keen's kind of just chilling farming
5:02:56
up against the Aurora it just feels like ji is squeezing every little bit out of this
5:03:02
game yeah they really are and even if Keane wasn't that fed he could just
5:03:08
still do poppy things I feel like poppy naturally tanky you pick it for denying
5:03:14
dashes and for big alts onto junglers onto you know key Targets in
5:03:21
fights they're trying to get this first turret who's going to actually pick it up looks like it should go the way to
5:03:27
gen G there it goes that's your Feats I have found the Feats and they're on the side of gen
5:03:34
G almost all of them even the objectives and as you said it's a it's a relatively
5:03:40
calm game it's it's nothing flashy geni aren't going crazy they found the one pick on a poosi and that was it the kill
5:03:47
win to Duro it just feels like it's C in some
5:03:56
ways similar to last game but just more pressure bit more gold generated uh but
5:04:02
still it feels like that slow controlled sort of style and the question is I feel
5:04:07
like the Bro win really it was them breaking out of that cuz there were definitely points in that Series where
5:04:13
it felt like ji got them in their grips and it was going to go through that again the game slowed down geni seemed
5:04:19
like they're going control uh and then it kind of just felt like hamach was like you know what time to make a play
5:04:25
time to make something happen break the pace of the game and honestly I feel like that's when H beat them last summer
5:04:31
in the finals it very much felt like breaking that pace of the game that geni
5:04:37
set I feel like if you let them be the Pace Setters and you just you're not winning you're never going to win you
5:04:43
have to be proactive and it's not just like endlessly charge at them that's obviously not going to work either but
5:04:48
you have to find the right moments uh and I think if you just are too patient you're just not going to do anything the
5:04:54
best defense is a great offense right [Laughter]
5:05:01
true and at the moment D freaks they don't have any
5:05:07
offense there's kind of sitting back farming you know just
5:05:13
losing a lot of vision not really fighting for any big objectives just here but like can they
5:05:19
even get close to that thing yeah Dragon M 45 I would like them to try and fight that at
5:05:26
least that's like the bad minimum looking for some damage in mid
5:05:32
onto life we do know that ruler is an incredible Ezreal player so you know when you were saying not enough damage
5:05:39
he's is able to carry a lot of it at least if he gets ahead which as we know in this game he is I mean we saw that
5:05:45
the T1 game when smash is playing Asal like you can pump numbers as as you yeah you really can I mean this is all just
5:05:51
solo like that all the damage all the gone Health that's all from Mara and now
5:05:56
keen's doing his job okay alter way the key Target I I press my w that's it the engage comes in the front line is gone
5:06:03
the damage is there the vile right on toan as Dudu desperately tries to get on the ruler but you just G him and he's
5:06:10
totally fine he actually almost did die at the end of it all but Rials taken and
5:06:17
as you mentioned very important to the ad car still has a splash yeah I just
5:06:22
think I mean I know I said they need to do something but that felt kind of desperate kind of forced um they kind of
5:06:29
came in a little bit late the ult came out from Keen knocked away the ambessa uh and it just the fact was it
5:06:36
already been poked out so heavily by ruler like the the fight had already been won the m just didn't know it yet
5:06:43
and it was some more that poke that came through and then the followup was just geni cleaning up but now they can look
5:06:48
towards Dragon they have control of that and DM freaks aren't even going to
5:06:54
contest Three Dragons already uh about 18 minutes is uh this game is just it's
5:07:00
rough it's just cold they're just not giving them an inch to breathe it's two to zero and it
5:07:08
feels like the series is two to zero still early on in this game but they're about to get Mountain Soul Point very
5:07:15
slowly this Canyon slowly punches the dragon to
5:07:21
death and there you go third Drake to their side they have the rift Herald on
5:07:27
Canyon as well probably just going to drop it in mid at some point there it
5:07:32
is and here they go stole that Minion from ruler
5:07:39
there they did and maybe something here trying to trying to really pressure the
5:07:44
turret they're going to get the turret tp's coming in but I mean they might get
5:07:50
Duro they might be able to do
5:07:56
yeah um anyway uh moving back to that fight
5:08:04
so like life this game life is already on half Yos is like half now as he goes
5:08:09
in the Essa I love the decision from Keen cuz the Essa has more value than the Z
5:08:14
right now straight onto pungy he doesn't get to do anything Doo goes in Chun
5:08:21
ruler just engages but it just felt like there was never really any the fight from the DM freaks he was
5:08:26
like oh I we have to fight they're about to take oh they already got help we'll fight anyway and then just nothing happened you
5:08:32
know kind of feels like they've just been watching the game pass by and you see the gold graph there very even in
5:08:39
terms of them just building up the advantages and doesn't even have a real Spike he's
5:08:45
about to get it like the problem is right but they didn't B ruler Flash in that fight and he's about to hit his two
5:08:52
item Spike which is massive yeah so now going into the next fight he's still he's going to have a Summoner spells and
5:08:58
it's going to be that much harder and I feel like when you're more proactive in a game he did it you're constantly
5:09:04
burning Summoner spells this is why sometimes it can be really hard to sit back for a long time and wait for a
5:09:10
window to strike because everyone's going to have all Summoners up but there's no action and then it makes it
5:09:15
so much harder like rer now has essentially his Flash and his arane shift double Escape uhoh he can play
5:09:21
aggressive but he can also just play defensive if he thinks he's threatened and you're not going to get on top of him um whereas if you know they were
5:09:27
looking for little Windows trying to find advantages maybe it could have backfired but the alternative is that
5:09:32
they would have been some more Summoners and be able to threaten cuz now look how confident geneng are setting up the
5:09:38
sakan they don't feel any threat yeah Duro is able to hold the door right in
5:09:43
front of them Keen is just kind of roaming in behind them like escorting Pana away from the fight and they say
5:09:51
well we've got the Poke Advantage so why don't we just go ahead and poke now that we have ruler items online a bit of a
5:09:57
combo here nice hook on auro but the front line is still so tanky Canyon has to flash over the wall rer is going to
5:10:04
get engaged on but the Gallo right on top of everybody let's see if we can get
5:10:09
do to do something on this he's being burnt to a Cris by the Isreal just so incredibly fast and Keen is going to
5:10:16
take the kill down not even a clean fight that was half under the turret and jeni still bopped them over the head
5:10:23
yeah I mean definitely felt like it maybe could have been an overstep for Gen but at the end of the day you know they had the Summoners to back
5:10:29
themselves up they managed to disengage in the situation ruler still survived we'll see a replay off that one
5:10:35
get heavily poked out on the turret the RO does over step a here and get caught
5:10:40
out stalled under Tower Canyon goes in aggressive does have to flash away but
5:10:46
then Ru it he can Flash to disengage in the situation still has zaran Shi afterwards to get away for the ambessa
5:10:52
choby gets a great taunt and Keen is there to keep him safe just feels like
5:10:57
they have the tools to deal with the threats and again those Summoners being available meant they could uh get away
5:11:03
from that one but I will say we have a a dragon in a minute 15 yes DM freaks are about 3.5k go behind I mean the dragon's
5:11:09
up that's all we also have the atakan you need to kill ruler and now it's a time when he has no flash and before he
5:11:16
picks up something defensive like a ga or even like a blood thirster now is
5:11:22
the time you need to find a good fight but it looks like gen is trying to find one themselves pan just got his TP and
5:11:28
he's trying to TP into this fight now but okay trying desperately to engage on the tank G I don't think that's the
5:11:34
angle POI like that's feel so forced a flash knock up on the on a
5:11:40
chovy I I think he should just let them go turn on alakan if you want to force something start the objective but
5:11:47
flashing onto as you said the tank Gallo perhaps not the play they push the wave up now though they're going to try clear
5:11:53
out some Vision Keane's just running at them look at the poppy just running in a straight
5:11:59
line at the enemy team I mean who can engage on Keen everyone's Dash Bas he wants to jump in yeah just press
5:12:07
W well he's just going to do that and knock and knock into the wall there you go knocks the Nautilus away knocks the
5:12:14
embes into the wall and she just melts like paper and that's shakon I mean the
5:12:21
breaks they like they can't fight over this they got to go for the dragon and they should be able to take that down
5:12:26
just cuz it takes a long time to kill Aon but that is like the saddest consolation prize yeah that I've seen in
5:12:33
a long time it'd be a different story if they had three dragons and this was their soul but you're just stoling out
5:12:39
so like the small bit of armor and is not going to make a difference so gen handling that handling that one pretty
5:12:45
massively uh very patient Keen doing a great job of kind of playing body block
5:12:50
uh and denying any access and now they can look for even
5:12:57
more you know the expectation is DM freaks have to go towards the dragon he's getting in the tower as well gold lead ballooning at this point and what
5:13:04
can DM freaks do you engage on them they die they'll just respawn you'll probably lose more your so it's so funny we have
5:13:11
like so many passionate fans here for Gen G and generally whenever like any objective is taken they'll like go crazy
5:13:17
start clapping you know Genji got the oton and they're like the slightest little golf clap they're going to be
5:13:23
happy about this though because Berserker is kind of just all alone and duro's like I I'll just let you one V
5:13:29
one him bro and then he runs in Ste that
5:13:36
waso okay it's not the most egregious deal of the day because choby literally still r as Penta but it's a close second
5:13:43
it's number two it's number two for sure he just waited and was like it's like he was hiding from Canyon he's like oh I'm
5:13:49
not here I'm not here I'll Zone the rest of them away you can One V one oh he's low Health oh is this for
5:13:56
me is it for me yes apparently it is remember when real jungle was a thing
5:14:03
yeah and you would just Smite objectives from like 800,00 health yep very
5:14:09
balanced yeah used to be in every single game and we didn't have
5:14:15
Fearless yeah I was very afraid of those times fear yes not fear
5:14:24
X okay uh R has picked up the blood thirster yeah he's about to get his
5:14:30
flashback I think the window is gone uh and let's let's fully examine this so
5:14:35
you see him he's like oh yeah I'm uh oh like 506
5:14:43
gold [Laughter]
5:14:49
oh has kind of like a Meek reaction he's like oh is he angry like kind of like
5:14:54
side eyes him uh how about a free Baron as P gets knocked away and Dian freaks
5:15:01
run away Y no much you can do that well life's dead um maybe the
5:15:08
disengage com he does get an ALT off and finally DM freaks decide to push their buttons the ambessa gets in the backline
5:15:15
trying to take out Duro but Keane flashes in and knocks her into the wall just perfectly played kean's poppy has
5:15:22
been excellent and this game is pretty much over from here ruler wants another
5:15:28
one but he will not have it at least gets the flash out of berserker The only positive of that situation was that the
5:15:34
adakam buff timed out so Duro actually died that's it's the only positive for DM freaks they actually got him they
5:15:41
actually got him um other than that they're just getting clapped and there's no other way to spin it
5:15:46
geni reing after the lost to bro uh very decisive with how they're handling this
5:15:53
uh series and this game you know they have the puppy it's so easy to start it
5:15:58
Keen has has played it so well uh really flawlessly Landing that Al there and knocking away Z I think he's player of
5:16:06
the match right I think he might well be te Sante yeah into this doing pretty
5:16:12
good I mean I I would have given it to R but he only got a quarter kill on a Penta right yeah you know I don't give P
5:16:20
for Quad kills rer played well don't get me wrong but he also was just playing fed Corky like attacking he also didn't
5:16:25
get a penac kill he also didn't get a penac kill so honestly I don't think he deserves it whereas Keane is about to no
5:16:31
he's not we we only have two media votes now so we can actually you know have balanced votes so I I think that Keen oh
5:16:38
my God look at that shield on Keen yeah he's pretty strong he's very
5:16:44
tanky you know puppy super tanky super hot to kill oh that buckler so right now
5:16:50
on the Korean side it's uh sun and this is a guy that like never has nothing to say and I can hear him over there like
5:16:57
not having anything to say he's like well the game's pretty W they just
5:17:03
attacked him they just killed him it just happened like that's the way this game is going they're just killing them
5:17:09
it's it's cover your eyes it's just desperation from the DM freaks now as
5:17:15
the taunt comes in and ji's assassin Gallo as a tank I guess there's another
5:17:20
one and keen's going to get the kill very deserved looking for the final one that's another knock on the wall and he
5:17:26
will pick up The Kill as well finally thankfully I'd even say this game is over gen Z un ceremoniously just Bop the
5:17:34
DM freaks over the head and they make them look not very good but it is just J
5:17:41
who are quite strong and they are back and I think this makes it clear J are a very strong team well I'm glad we fig
5:17:49
that out today build different okay uh you know people might think hey gen G not no it's just bro are just build
5:17:55
different okay they're the Final Bosses it's true DM freaks uh I don't think
5:18:01
really hyong I think he had a you know I don't think it's really on him no uh subed into a difficult situation gen
5:18:07
were here for a win they were not happy with the loss last time group Elder gets even further on the lead it's still
5:18:13
mathematically possible I believe but I think it's getting to the point where like it's not realistic there are seven matches
5:18:19
left group Elder is six matches ahead okay so group I'm going to say it group
5:18:26
Baron would have to win every single match from here until the end of group stage I'm going to say it group Baron on
5:18:33
winning right for my estimations I don't think they're going to win I know this so bold it's so early to call this but I
5:18:39
think group Elder are safe right now and I think for group AR and you're kind of thinking can we get any wins to avoid
5:18:45
being at the bottom of the group particularly for bnk FX who are sitting there right now at a 04 score line
5:18:53
so the freaks are the closest uh right now bnk would have to beat Nim the final
5:18:59
match of group stage and uh dnf would have to lose everything 02 and then
5:19:04
maybe yeah I think what's important is that you D freak's losing 20 here game score is going to be significant in
5:19:10
group Baron so it is a pretty heavy blow to have lost this 20 but Genji they were messed around uh especially as they got
5:19:17
defeated two of themselves I think ultimately it was this game was felt
5:19:22
even more controlled than the last one like given no out I think at least the the game before the M freaks I felt like
5:19:28
they were trading a bit more evly evenly in the early game but here it was like there was this one fight which was so
5:19:34
late in the game already and it just it felt like geni was so prepared already
5:19:40
and as soon as this fight was done I I don't think they got another look in in the game and they had this one for sure
5:19:45
but other than burning ruler's flash which they weren't able to capitalize on afterwards they didn't even win the
5:19:53
fight yeah it um it was just the power of the comp as well that we talked about
5:19:59
like if it gets ahead and you have enough damage with the Ezreal it's so bulky it spikes so hard in the mid game
5:20:05
you you you can't get through all the layers like Keen was doing it alone but then he had like the gallol you had the
5:20:12
Ral for engaged in front line there a lot of Peel tools as well bu to lock people down tons of CC and you know
5:20:19
different teams different game we maybe could have seen this geni composition struggle if if it started to get really
5:20:24
late but that never happened wasn't a reality and they were confident they could make it
5:20:30
work we'll see what they have to say here just attack the front line no flash
5:20:39
okay okay okay okay he didn't die okay I got him no
5:20:45
flash no flash ni
5:20:51
nier nobody says anything else oh the little cop the awkward cops
5:20:59
I guess we uh I think it's so funny how how D+ were so hype when they beat H earlier and ji just like I feel maybe
5:21:06
it's maybe it's maybe it's as a of the loss against bro it's like all business now yeah I mean that's fair or maybe I
5:21:13
respect it maybe ruler just had a had a massive rant after get the penta
5:21:19
stolen just like got he had like a total breakdown backstage was just like really
5:21:24
awkward stuck my vent everybody's like wow this guy is really hardcore uh we didn't know that
5:21:31
uh well they should have known that he's being in the team before especially chovi you know well anyway I I think
5:21:37
that um okay Canyon's going to win it uh the the crowd seemed pretty surprised by that
5:21:44
I'm pretty surprised by I guess it's because of his lease in performance in the first game which was quite good yeah
5:21:49
his V was fine as well I mean who' you vote for uh I went for Keane oh cuz I
5:21:55
thought the poy ults were really big and is Cante team fighting he had that little bit at the start I can understand
5:22:00
why people wouldn't vote for him cuz at the start he had missed some abilities which is a bit but he kind of came back with it in the team fights and then his
5:22:06
poppy game he was just he just kept finding the targets he wanted with the old every single time yes cassand was
5:22:12
good his poy was great I I think uh again pretty unceremonious from geneng
5:22:18
they made it look uh very straightforward their coaches really straightened them up and maybe ruler did
5:22:23
as well but guys we have the interview ready to go right now I'm going to hand it over to Dear for the
5:22:28
translation thank you very much guys this is dear for the LK cup P interview translation joined by Canyon on the side
5:22:36
of ji congratulations thank
5:22:41
you this is Chen's third Victory how do you
5:22:47
feel it's great to win with a two and yeah it's been a really long
5:22:53
time since I've been on the stage for an interview yeah in the Korean analyst
5:23:00
desk rasco said that it made his day from seeing you play so well so how satisfied are you with your play
5:23:08
I feel like I made less mistakes today so I think I'm
5:23:15
pretty and in game one with rer ruler's cor getting up to
5:23:22
Quadra all it took was stepping aside to let him get his pent but it was robbed
5:23:28
by chovy so was rer disappointed about it at
5:23:35
all CH and actually saw that we got
5:23:41
aan from the kill loog so they actually weren't aware so I think they genuinely
5:23:46
just didn't know so Canyon if it was up to you would
5:23:54
you let ruler have his Penta you know I think I would always
5:23:59
try to let my teammates get Penta because there's not a lot of times not
5:24:05
every day you get a Penta it's it just creates good memory do you want to say anything to
5:24:11
chy then you know I'm just going to say chy really should probably didn't know he
5:24:18
probably genuinely didn't know and in game two you know Canyon you were working
5:24:25
really hard for that enemy kaisa kill and duro came swooping into snip and K
5:24:30
you did you know oh yeah he took the kill and he said oh I'm sorry but to be
5:24:36
honest and you know like every kill that that kill in particular wasn't very
5:24:43
meaningful so it was okay you know just in case you missed it let's take a look
5:24:49
at duro's face
5:24:58
again that guilty look on his face did you were you aware you know I only listen to his
5:25:06
voice but you know what a fun
5:25:12
Elder is now at 12 wins so just one win is all it takes for group Elder to
5:25:18
secure the winner spot so yeah group Elder has been doing really well and they're so reliable
5:25:25
they've been doing great and I hope that we are able to secure all the wins the
5:25:31
rest of the wins and any word for the fans for the holiday
5:25:38
it's going to be Lunar New Year and I'm so grateful that you guys are all here I
5:25:44
hope you have a great holiday and that's the end of the interview with Canyon and back to the
5:25:50
space thank
5:25:56
you thank you very much dear aaya chat let's put claps in the chat for geni as
5:26:03
they deserve that after the victory and gave those out to the DN freaks after that series it was a
5:26:09
two Deon here alongside chronicler and wolf and that was very one-sided a
5:26:16
couple of multiple kills stolen away gen just taking care of business sometimes you know games happen like the Bro vers
5:26:22
gen series that makees you go wow I can't believe this is happening this is amazing lck is popping and sometimes a
5:26:28
series is just exactly what you'd expect and you're just watching it unfold and you're like yep you that did happen you
5:26:34
know the uh phrase that this series could have been an email you know uh emails are pretty instantaneous that
5:26:40
took a little while I feel like this series could have been a fact you know what I mean I don't this series could
5:26:46
have been a fact what's what what's a fact where you dial in a number location
5:26:52
with a piece of paper in it it sends an image of that to another printed out no
5:26:57
I need to know this have you guys ever actually fed anything cuz I have not of course I I have how do you send
5:27:02
documents to people for the internet you have to send out facts you know what is a fact indeed the player of the match
5:27:09
let's take a look at some of those P votes for uh this series as it was split
5:27:15
could have gone multiple different ways but six of them go the wave Canyon both of yall voted for ruler here though uh
5:27:21
we that that was mostly just because he won on Cor key really I don't know this this one lane against Ash Braum on Cor I
5:27:29
think Canyon to me the moment that he went you know I think he had a really good kick but then he also just didn't
5:27:36
look that convincing out mid lane play like the other kick iot
5:27:42
actually that's the one that I heard I'm like you know what that might actually big cuz Keen has been playing great I think Keen is the only one
5:27:51
as do it l [Music] Soul this is not what really sounds like
5:27:58
I don't know I can't rer voice I'm not as cool as him what am I supposed to do complet
5:28:03
sold it you did Benta a few times and you're dare b b Benta there you go miled it and then hit him
5:28:10
with the movie the romcom movie line uh what did you put there chronicler cuz he didn't really have
5:28:17
like I'm pretty sure he didn't die you know was chovy for stealing his pent
5:28:22
that's because uh kaisa was picked on the other side wolf a known uh kaisa anti right now yeah in this meta in this
5:28:29
meta counter to Israel not not on when rulers on the other side I guess I think
5:28:34
I so as a tanks for the win uh p from Ax from aux here from ax ax
5:28:42
I andessa but Keen did not allow is this a I don't is I'm feeling like this is a
5:28:50
pun again uh I feel like has been doing a lot of those oh no Al but Rascal's the leas in
5:28:58
guy he was our best Le this was yeah 2022 KT when he was the best top laner arguably he had like a solo kill record
5:29:06
and he didn't even make playoffs it was very very sad very sad one more do we have one
5:29:12
more we do not have one more I've been told let's take a look do we have one
5:29:19
highlight we have the first highlight we do yeah we got one look at the first highlight it's a long one it's last
5:29:25
series yeah and and just like how this game fell the first highlight is just a whole lot of nothing uh because it felt
5:29:33
like d freaks just never really showed up in this game can you hear hear the
5:29:38
and then the the facts getting printed out right now the facts okay don't keep going back to the facts cuz I guarantee
5:29:45
you most of our audience have never like I know what a effect no we've got awes in the chat they're aware of what the
5:29:50
facts is yeah they know what it is but they haven't used it there's a lot of old relics of Technology young people know about like a phone that has a cord
5:29:57
attached to it in like the kitchen they've seen that before I mean I think tegram are telegrams are neat as well
5:30:03
but we don't use them anymore answering machines come on no one has an
5:30:08
everyone's seen a facts that there's high school or whatever you know come on they still use that away messages okay
5:30:14
that's not that's twoo Niche basically uh what what we're describing here is what we we're seeing is just geni just
5:30:21
ran over this game and for for D and freaks to me the top side really needs to start performing better right I think
5:30:28
that particularly piosik and life at no point this season have looked like they're on the same page if they
5:30:34
don't fix that and if Dudu doesn't go back to some of his previous years performed I don't think this team is going to perform I also think I want to
5:30:41
add one kind of comment about this team is I feel like Bulldog was in his best games really impactful even in losses
5:30:48
and was a huge uh reason why they almost got back into some of their lost uh games and pingon felt very muted in this
5:30:55
series felt very invisible and he had some weird builds like he went for the old uh companion build on Victor in game
5:31:01
one went conqueror on Aurora in game two we weren't a huge fan of it and just in general I think he's not experienced
5:31:07
enough and I I get it you want to give him some experience you put him in the the deep end with this shenji match up today but I want to see more Bulldog I
5:31:13
don't think Pan's ready yet I don't think this team is necessarily looking for that type of player right now yeah but that's what the lck cup is for and
5:31:19
we've seen so many different teams use uh substitutions to gather information and figure out how things go makes it
5:31:26
tough when you're using old technology old runes there yeah this one was a machine like a fax machine thank you
5:31:32
wolf hammering that one home I love it I love it cronnie he's stunned look at him
5:31:37
he's stunned he can't he can't take the fact machine anymore Cron's got a phonograph in his house what's he so
5:31:43
concerned about he's got a record player in there
5:31:48
too he still listens to cassettes come on I do actually have a cassette eight track I'm I'm I he clocked me I'm done
5:31:56
well uh updated are the standings cuz we just played those and we can update it
5:32:02
right away the CD ROM is sitting at
5:32:08
freaks Dro down to one and three and now like ox said on the cast we be battling
5:32:15
it out for win score game score here as the Bros had the big upset and it was a
5:32:21
2-0 and bnk FX will have to look for a victory
5:32:27
the biggest takeaway is that hwa life is nowhere near they were expected and do
5:32:33
not next week we actually do have less matches because of the way that the LSK cup for it works we only have a single
5:32:39
uh five against five group format but all these matches are going to have a
5:32:44
really big impact particularly for the unfortunate members of group Baron because they have been really struggling
5:32:49
and whoever ends up being lost is going to be in a rough position now I do think
5:32:56
that H life should be able to beat at DRX handily but maybe UK can make a miracle what happen maybe being K their
5:33:02
last game is against nongshim you know that's a really really important match for them when if they lose it they actually go win in the group and even if
5:33:09
they win it they're not out necessarily they'll need DN freaks to also lose their match against KT and the game
5:33:15
score matters I also need to know Deon who are you predicting for pro DK because DK are right now are looking
5:33:21
like the best team in the league so does that mean that it's me versus you is that what does that mean I mean I'm I'm
5:33:28
leaning into it as a tomorrow what are we betting what what should we what should we bet on this one I need some time to think about that I'm not going
5:33:34
to be going mean bro has had a history of upsetting D+ Dom One gaming in the past true yeah we'll see uh T1 and red
5:33:42
Force tomorrow will kick it off and then it's bro time after the big win up against KT roster looking to bounce back
5:33:49
after their loss in the Telecom War it has been a great day of matches today
5:33:55
