31:24
oning hi
31:30
my welcome ladies and gentlemen to the 2025 lck cup I am Atlas I am joined by
31:37
chronicler and we are here for the final day before the solado holiday or the Luna New Year holiday uh if you don't
31:44
say the word in Korean and it can be a little bit difficult to say as well I struggled with it right then I think in
31:51
my uh expertly unexperienced
31:58
perfect we'll have to find out from Json at the end of the day whether I'm fired for my lack of being able to say it correctly um but for now we'll just stay
32:05
in suspense uh as actually she said something but I couldn't hear it because I was talking over her uh let's have a look at the standings here and dive into
32:11
where our two groups are sitting at the moment Baron still struggling unfortunately it is uh they've been
32:17
struggling to stay around the halfway point between themselves and group Elder and that does mean that uh bnk FX are
32:25
really in trouble especially after bro proved themselves the greatest team in lck history earlier on in the week being
32:32
able to put that number one next to the three on gen's score line today we have
32:37
some Banger matches and speaking of the Bros they'll be coming up next but first it is T1 taking on Nim and T1 do have a
32:46
couple of Rivals on this nongshim roster that they picked up after the end of last year so that's a lot of fun kingan
32:53
and lens have made many a T1 fan quite sad they really have uh GI has come
32:59
close with the legendary smolder game and performances as only a single win
33:06
for group Elder and they will be able and technically group Baron can still catch up because effectively this is a
33:13
best of 25 so one more win Will Group Elder over the uh uh over the line as we
33:20
do see Nim do every now and then it feels like you know bro beating a top
33:26
tier team it doesn't have often but it happens often enough that it makes us wonder if today is going to be one of
33:32
those days yep and smash is going to be back in the lineup once again just a reminder substitutions are perfectly
33:39
fine and normal here in the lck and everywhere else on the planet when it comes to Esports so uh smash going to be
33:46
playing one more time up against jiu here and he was so good in his debut match here in the lck I think many of us
33:53
had high expectations for smash but didn't think he was going to destroy KT the way that he did and way mental
34:00
especially yeah way mental not looking too hard uh dock not looking amazing
34:05
really the only KT G that benefited from that series was was hype uh who will be
34:10
playing today the hype stock the hype stock they are rising Atlas as here
34:17
today T1 are still going to be the clear favorites I think smash showed some impeccable Forman GI as much as I love
34:23
my Challenger 8 carries has not been able to hit the highest that he did did say 2 years ago I think 2023 J really
34:30
was a very special player and we need to see that here today if we want to go to another Banger series between these two
34:37
yep not to mention Fisher needing to sort of Set Set uh step up his performance as well um up against fer it
34:44
is a tall order but something that is going to be necessary if Nim do want to stand a chance I think the rest of the
34:50
the team probably going to be able to Rally around Fisher finding some form so
34:55
it's a tough ask but we'll see whether they can get it together as D shim looking for a bit of a miracle here to
35:01
just push group Elder into Victory already before we're even really towards
35:07
the end of this uh round robin T1 wanting to hold on to it for team Baron
35:13
and we'll see whether they can do so again and I think a lot of people's eyes will be glued to smash we remember when
35:19
he when he debuted I remember you being incredibly annoying talking about this player incessantly that does happen a
35:25
lot and then you guys all watched him you like you know what chronicler you were onto something there but there have
35:31
been some doozies in your repertoire right actually I think if we have a lot of downtime I was talking a broken clock
35:36
is right twice a day okay well I've been both right and wrong much more often I I
35:41
kind of wanted to get into it like what my hit rate is if we look uh I think he'd be lucky to be 50/50 that's what I
35:48
was aiming for yeah I'll take a coin flip when it comes
35:53
to Challenger players my excitement gets the better of me sometimes times as we
35:58
take a look Gideon still playing we have I'm pretty sure not seen Sylvia has been
36:04
in Challengers has been fine Sil played in uh Cas cup and in Challenger I think
36:09
a bit um but yeah he's still playing in in Challenger yeah so he still playing in Challenger means that he's probably not going to be uh with us especially
36:16
not for this series so we'll see whether he is going to be um subbing in towards the end of the round robin here as there
36:22
is smash I remember like after their his first series here in the lck
36:28
I think he had a celebration worthy performance but you saw him afterwards I
36:33
if if you hadn't told me anything provided me no context I would have assumed he just lost a series and lost
36:40
it by himself because he looked so incredibly overwhelmed so we'll see whether you know cuz it looked to me
36:46
like he just had a level of seriousness about what he could improve on and seemed like he was being very very harsh
36:53
on uh on what he demonstrated here on the the Lark stage and I think that's a good sign also a little bit of a
36:59
dangerous sign because you don't need to be that hard on yourself I don't think it really also is with exception of some
37:05
specific players a challenger special you know these players have been working towards his goal for years wanting to debut being on T1 uh adds another layer
37:14
of pressure to that given the both historical significance the fact you're playing next to Faker the fact that uh
37:21
they have been so dominant internationally over the last couple of years so there's a lot that comes
37:27
together there so it's understandable I think like the only players that were exceptions to the rule are people like
37:33
Duro that are just like no I'm going to be the best even if they haven't really been performing up to that level yet
37:39
we'll see if they're able to make it happen even players like Gushi when he subbed in for Teddy for the first time I feel like he was just just chilling he
37:47
did log Draven um which was awesome first series didn't care too much about
37:53
it was in no unfortunately well we're into the pick and ban here and we'll see
38:00
what the result of that is going to be thankfully Nong shim uh have learned from KT's mistakes and so we'll actually
38:07
have a real game for game one scanner having been banned away we've got a lot of just really scary Champions taken
38:13
away by T1 here we'll see what the final ban is to come out from for fun I think
38:19
Banning Cante would make some sense I do feel like there is a lot that is
38:24
available for first pick though and uh VI certainly standing out is something that owner could be very comfortable on
38:30
opens up things like Faker Ari which would be pretty scary G yeah is G is a
38:36
scary one yeah uh it is kante Ban for fun so that's good means that maybe we'll get some interactive match up
38:42
Rumble pryo should also be quite High here although that's band away it was it was extraordinar high band away that is
38:49
interesting to me though the fact uh well the Jace pryo makes sense given that he's both flexible in build
38:54
and in roll but the fact that to me Aurora in the games where she's been good felt so oppressive that she has
39:01
been making it through a lot more actually she doesn't work she falls kind
39:07
of flat on her face I feel like she lot more yeah she doesn't do enough extra outside of like has a great laning phase
39:13
and then One-Shots people I think when you when she is at that point you're like wow this Champion's broken but I
39:19
think you need a certain amount of extra help so first picking it without knowing the your the composition you're going
39:25
for I think is uh is somewhat dangerous it's it's really dropped yeah in pryo as you highlight I do think with the right
39:31
amount of setup it can still be quite strong and the fact that it's a flex pick I think is always going to be a really big win for really any player but
39:41
particularly for a team like sh have in the past been happy to do some weird
39:46
things as the Z out I think oner has looked the best on this pick it's a pick
39:52
that I'm still pretty neutral about I feel like it's fine it's very versatile uh but
39:57
it does sometimes struggle when it is uh put behind early on as the Victor does
40:04
come through the it's so weird looking at the name you're like T1 oh they've got Jace zenzo Victor this makes no so
40:11
much sense for Zas owner and Faker yeah but then you see that it's Doran and Doran does play a different uh style of
40:19
Jace you could say a little bit more of the the team fight prowess outside of the absolutely dominated a side lane as
40:26
the Nautilus comes in yeah the Rada band then comes as like Rada Brum bands I would say I think is that Nautilus
40:34
priority a little high uh too much but it they're going to be playing dive
40:39
right so the other band that they might look towards is is funly enough Zia because I think otherwise te one might
40:46
just slam Z raan because with this lock in Nim is very clearly signaling what they're about to do which is Pile in on
40:53
Smash and Faker in every single fight depending on who is stronger and or further ahead so Braum would make sense
41:00
as a ban here I think Z would make sense as a ban raan I wouldn't feel as good
41:05
about have to see what Nim actually takes off the table here yeah they probably then pick up an 80 carry they
41:12
can also leave oh okay it will be desire so that does mean that Braum is still open let's see if that's something if
41:18
they end up going like yeah azreal Brum I think is signal here for T1 I think
41:23
you pick away the Braum put Nautilus Top Lane to deny it what do you reckon yeah
41:30
I'm game do it he yeah oh you can put Nautilus mid that was a thing in MSI like 2 years
41:36
ago yeah that that I mean we all witnessed that that didn't go very well um as it's going to be for us at least
41:44
it's going to be the Ezreal which should come as no surprise otherwise they would have definis and Ash both available Ash
41:51
crazy is my guess the only downside for T1 if they do that is that their only reliable engage is the ash Arrow which
41:58
is fine oh my God this is an incredible longc con for Nim though if they plan to lose this game and the enemy team picks
42:05
up an Asher or varis you can first pick the other one that that is the Fearless
42:10
way that it's pretty amazing that's assuming you have no bans at the start of the game which unfortunately you do that's Caitlyn Morana as the option and
42:17
remember ladies and gentlemen this is something that's been banned against Smash in his first two games uh KT made
42:24
sure that he wasn't able to get Caitlyn um every single time as carrier is just cycling through some things that he
42:31
could pick he's probably going to land on Lux um or at leaste that's a little bit more of the flavor of the month
42:37
style gives them some non-committal sort of engaged CC throwing out cocoons and things like that because there's not a
42:43
lot of engage on this comp there's not it's a big comp right with the zenzo I I know that there is some semblance of
42:48
Team fighting in there with with the Victor but realistically this comp is going to try to play through
42:55
particularly that strong side early on probably going to go for the beef your tank build and try to play from there
43:00
there's no way yes there is and actually it's a fine pick let's see how it is going to
43:06
go well wa this is a situation where we actually should be really good if the map is not in complete TS which
43:12
unfortunately I think is is what T1 is going to try and look for uh what you have here is a composition that with
43:18
that H and Asal combo can actually really punish the lack of engage for T1
43:24
they can obviously hard Force by either K going really deep owner going really deep but I think the T1 comp does rely
43:31
on them getting head early fortunately they do have zenzo Elise and Caitlyn so
43:36
most likely Nim is going to look for a lane swap neither Aurora nor Jace are particularly great in that situation you
43:43
know he'd much rather be ping a tank or something that uh I think that's another thing that the rumble does well where
43:49
you have a a good amount of wave clear and are a little bit more able to
43:54
contest for that wave early on I don't think either of them are going to be able to do so we'll have to see I
44:01
imagine Nima going to try and lop and we'll see what that actually is uh is
44:06
going to turn into but I I like the Nim comp if they get for the early game unscathed which I think there's a little
44:11
bit of like name plate factor that you do need to put into it I don't know whether like fer on way doesn't feel
44:17
like the right pick for him that being said I just wanted him to play The Fury was about to say that's that yeah that
44:24
was never hit and get Peak again we're not um but T1 it is a very very T1 draft
44:31
drafting for Lane has been the T1 Mo I feel for like seven years and it seems
44:36
to have worked because they're defending world champions so let's jump on the rift for game number
44:44
[Music]
44:51
one some loud Nim fans here at l park today but T1 of course um very very loud
44:57
on their end is wow trading flashes and who's got the hex flash neither of them lens you let me down yeah not going hex
45:04
flash that's crazy actually what that is your Rune oh even even did go for uh for
45:11
inspiration interesting odd let's see what he ends up going for do you think that's a big win at least not having
45:18
access to the flash both if you're playing 2v2 or if you're in a situation where kingan will be alone in a side
45:26
right now it is looking like it's actually going to be Smash and carrier opting into the lane swap I think it's
45:32
the uh predicting a lane swap to opt in for not the lane swap but what it means
45:38
is that because this control on the bottom side of the map is going to exist J being already down here and uh they
45:44
can just go to the bottom Lane they kind of should know with the amount of vision that they have oh they do not know oh
45:50
dear Doran going to be targeted first as there's hooks going everywhere flash out from owner is going to get him out of
45:55
Dodge but that means Gideon start on red and owner is on his way to the other
46:00
side of the map this early game is beautifully crafted from nonin T1 really did not see that one
46:08
coming uh you can see they're all out of sorts here as we do have Doran now also looking for a lane to go to can't really
46:14
go towards the bot Lane particularly with how much he's been chunked already and this was kind of like Doran ganking
46:19
fish's Lane but lens finding him means that it's a huge win for Nim it's also
46:24
just a tempo for the jungle right owner has to spend so much time walking like I'm pretty sure he'll be able to clear
46:30
fine I don't think that's going to be the limiting factor but we now have shove in mid lens is just being an
46:37
absolute wandering around Jester and I think his yeah he sees owner but like
46:43
he's obvious not going to beat the zenzo he can't really do he's just covering for kingan and whereas kingan has been
46:48
able to just get a ton of experience again that's main wow I think Doran avoided Vision
46:54
there on his way down could have been even worse and we'll be able to catch most of this way do note King actually was forced to
47:00
flash I imagine k caught him off guard maybe there was a trap setup not 100% sure I don't think this is diable now
47:07
with the state yeah that hitting level two as well yeah we'll see they do have
47:13
theas one of the best diving early game champions in the game but there's no wave I think they're just kind of
47:19
spending a lot of time with a play that doesn't seem to be working out and Yeah owner is still sticking around they are
47:26
gong on making has happen Atlas yeah well let's see whether they can make it work Leen sitting at full health right
47:32
now carrier wanting to find that cocoon gets it but great buffer on the anchor kinging bounces back let's see what can
47:38
happen here they get on top of the Aurora and take her down carrier repelling just to get himself out of the
47:43
way as we're looking for a bit of a hook J fighting against Doran here Doran winning out on that one very very
47:49
handily but first Blood going over to T1 without tooo much of a fuss well shame on me for overestimating the turret K
47:57
barely even needing the diving capabilities of the Elise there doesn't end up repelling until the very ends and
48:05
the Damage actually I think also kind of catching Nim of guard he definitely had
48:11
an opportunity there to drop the wave leave the turret so credit to T1 for
48:16
finding the dive angles Faker will spot the back uh okay he also knows that the
48:21
vi is there as well yeah he he warded over the the Raptor pit how was like
48:27
Gideon now's your chance but I think Gideon even saw the ward go down so he knew that it wasn't going to be an issue yeah it was ped yeah for Faker if he
48:34
tries to cancel and he you know gets queed then yeah kind of just goes down so I think gide call also just really
48:41
wants to back as we now have TPS coming in here for both Nim solo laners and
48:47
experience because of that kingan who actually had a much better early setup is now behind about what like half of a
48:56
level yeah doing a really good job of recovering from that early
49:02
game just keeping cool Cal and collected and it looked like it was a bit dire but
49:07
they didn't Panic so now that everything's sort of evened out the gold lead is
49:14
approximately First Blood um that's all that's really in it here maybe a little bit of
49:19
change so T1 pretty happy with how that one's gone Gideon being able to pick up this first dragon would certainly help
49:25
even that out we've got 50 seconds until the grubs are up and available as King in bouncing around this bottom
49:32
Lane and is still just taking a lot from these shock blasts that are raining
49:37
through from Doran fish comes down to help out so Gideon will be a to secure this then should also be in position to
49:44
head over towards these grubs and oner making his way back out
49:50
onto the map as well as lens and probably going to be under the turret a fair bit uh in this match up yeah just
49:56
need to respect the threat that comes down from the El the difference with the Morana Lane which obviously has the
50:03
extra safety and is that you know Morana Q is very slow uh not so much for kocon
50:11
and even though Lux is pretty respectable damage Elise really does just feel like you know you're playing
50:17
against jungle Elise but she's in your lane permanently which isn't very fun in terms of early burst that she has
50:23
available just for runes and her base damages the one thing that is going pretty well here for Nim is Fisher Lane
50:31
specifically will now catch most of this wave and equalize again but mostly in ter of pryo has actually been able to
50:37
allow Gideon to do stuff right the fact that they were able to get that dragon is nice does look like with the vision
50:42
control plus the fact that Nim need to respect that possibility of Smashing
50:47
carrier sticking around they will not be able to contest the grubs I do think this is setting up for
50:54
a mid game that's going to have some honest fights and SC in it though and that's what we kind of want to see because these two compositions but heads
51:00
in interesting ways and the battle for neutral is going to be so huge just with the fact that nongin wants to keep them
51:06
at Bay and hit them with the whe poke and things like this but T1 has options as well so will the shock blasts be
51:13
landing or will fer be the one that can actually dictate how this one goes Mystic shots as well you know like J
51:19
will have a fair bit of agency to try and make stuff happen but then Caitlyn is going to be out of Auto attack from a
51:25
lot further away as well so the fail lanks can be put together for T1 could be really really good for them and we know smash is a terrifying Caitlin
51:32
player yeah it's interesting thinking about how these early skirmishes are going to play out because T1 I imagine
51:38
will just be looking for a pick with the amount of CC they have available early and for Nong shim when they started out
51:45
with this Aurora Ai and the really high priority in the early naus I was really expecting it to be a dive P but
51:52
with a lot of damage on the fer here yeah should be enough to at least maintain that mid pryo but that right
51:59
there is I think a good example both we and Ezreal ideally want to get multiple rotations of spells of like ezreal's
52:06
burst is okay but it does feel like the skirmishes for them until they reach a good amount of items are going to be
52:11
kind of awkward because if like Gideon jumps in on zenzo for example like he is
52:17
not dying in the CC combo yeah and K is
52:22
going to be really hard to lock down smashes both sums as well as barrier and I think his positioning is has been great thus far so I kind of have a hard
52:29
time seeing how Nim is going to do in these early skirmishes besides just trading across the map I think it'll
52:35
have to take some heroics from someone like lens perhaps finding an engage that he's looking for as smash taking a bit
52:42
of damage here as there's a Flash Forward they get on top of car trage they trying to B and they take him down
52:48
you could see that was orchestrated by leens and jiu beautifully played to even out the kill
52:54
score the level six Spike of eal remember that period where he he just
53:01
did this every single game and his laning phase was kind of oh yeah the first like trop barrage Giga buff oh
53:07
that was that was hard to watch yeah both was a like Q ad buff and then also the TR it was nuts it was winning every
53:14
lane but that right there was somewhat reminiscent and that's a big win the
53:19
kill not going over to gu is the only downside of that that would have been ideal obviously as getting flashes issue
53:26
as well might mean that T1 should be able to strike back as well yeah so in
53:32
the short term definitely a big winner for Nim also mostly equalizes the gold might make some of the setup harder but
53:38
it does mean that if they get another one of those and gu actually does get the kill I think things are going to be looking good so I want to see what
53:44
happens here cuz it looks initially like he's planning to go in on Smash but then he doesn't actually get the auto off
53:51
smash is able to get out but the old was from the beginning on carer right so it was a really nice F there causing smash
53:58
to go back meaning that they didn't have the damage and Carri I think also getting caught a little bit of guard hit by the point blank gold and also was in
54:04
human form right so you have to turn to spider before you can then repel to to buy that extra space and they killed her
54:11
within that time um which is a pretty small window but lens designed support
54:16
Elise 6 years ago right he built her in a lab like he is the guy that came up
54:22
with this this is this is his recipe um and so very capable of understanding the
54:28
weaknesses it's a cooking show and you're making like a beef wellington for Gordon Ramsey and he's just sitting
54:33
there like he breaks down the door and says no I made this yeah this is not good enough uh what is good enough is
54:39
T's ability to just absolutely slam this turet yeah Nim don't really seem ready
54:45
for this kingan might TP back but I don't know whether that's AA definitely can't so I'm glad he didn't but I've
54:52
seen some TPS uh at start yeah but like that's just going to be that should be
54:58
just fats of strength that's going to be just sandals going over to T1 it's not the end of the world but the the cross map trade doesn't seem great here it's
55:05
going to be what like a plate and grubs maybe two plates but still you're giving up dragon as well think T going to be
55:12
very happy with this yep getting the Fancy Shoes is definitely the main thing as King in in a bit of trouble here that
55:17
flash cocoon was gorgeous but the knock up is going to come through denies some Q damage as well and so lens saving his
55:24
teammates left right and center but Fisher let's see whether he can be saved death rate comes down but not going to
55:29
be able to do too much more as my gosh okay Smash and carrier now just get more
55:35
free time with this turret so the thing is Nong Shimmer like narrowly escaping and doing cool mechanics to get away from things but then they still lose all
55:42
their stuff afterwards so it doesn't doesn't matter that much no the objectives are still going
55:48
very much in favor of T1 as you're saying we do have another infernal we've had a ton of those it's been a to a very
55:55
INF type situation if it's fitting for LC cup I think that's kind of the vibe
56:01
yep you know fast fiery and it's got a noxian theme you can see everything
56:06
looks a little bit like it's the the height of summer in Australia I don't know whether anybody else other than
56:12
Australians knows that but everything just turns yellow um it used to be green not anymore it's all dead and and so it
56:18
all just goes yellow and so it's similar Vibe you know it's got a a heated up sort of theme I'm there with you bit of
56:24
hering commentary there from Atlas yeah I apologize for that one that's fine Doran is trapping G or is it the other
56:32
way around well at least is there so I'm pretty sure that they have to respect lens is there as well let's see whether he can tank up enough damage here to
56:38
keep J alive the answer is yes but smash is still going to come up the same situation right it's like they turn up
56:44
and Nim are like aha we got away but then Caitlyn's still there to destroy your
56:50
stuff they don't have enough energy to stop the Demolition Man from coming in
56:55
and he is going to going to do so still hens and J will be able to pick up this wave and it looks like they have
57:01
other things on their mind as Gideon could be in trouble has to flash but there's the flash knock up a in the hole
57:07
comes down as well as Gideon trying to taxi out via Faker it's not going to do enough decent damage here from fer oh
57:13
Faker is going to be taken down Nim trying to get a little bit back here as owner goes in will be able to get a nice
57:19
little knock up onto kingan and in comes dor nice shock blast will connect kingan's in trouble smash grabs it with
57:25
the very end Of The Peacemaker and he's not making very much peace with that one this game leen's moving on over as well
57:32
but he's lumbering in a little bit too slow to really get anything done has Nim they're just doing less and T's doing
57:38
more is what it feels like this game they are getting consistently out rotated feels like T1 always have an
57:44
extra member on the map it feels like they're playing with six but this should be kind of a no-brainer from Gideon we
57:50
just witnessed ker and smash towards the top side of the map so try trying to
57:56
clear the ward against the Elise and cading combo not going to work out king and actually really nicely done there good amount of damage but owner stays
58:03
very healthy and even with caras cocon not quite hitting here the damage is already done I mean it hit why hit
58:09
Fisher yeah uh and also it doesn't matter right they still get the kill as Doran actually with really good timing
58:15
there as well and this is exactly what you'd expect from Team One with this type of composition continuous roaming
58:22
being ahead of the opponents in the rotation and looking for these continuous skirmishes as minus one for Fisher 2K gold deficit at 14 minutes is
58:30
pretty sizable it is especially when there's like a one kill difference and a one turret difference right like there's
58:37
not a lot of like at one Dragon a piece as well like everything else seems somewhat even yeah um except from being
58:43
able to to kill minions and and be in the right spots and take plates and that sort of stuff there are basically two EV
58:50
use cuz I think T1 is about to reach the break point where Nim just never get to do anything on the map anymore
58:56
I don't think we're there just yet and if Nim can keep the gold lead at this point get the second item up on fer and
59:03
GI I think this composition is really going to start to shine as they actually do have both amazing poke but like
59:09
getting in a position to poke right now is just the they're not able to because they have basically no pryo in any of
59:15
the lanes outside of when fer was able to generate some against Faker but even that's now kind of Gone by the wayside
59:21
so you just have Zin in every lane showing up Caitlin obviously out pushes
59:27
you uh Aurora has been put behind so Doran is just continuously bringing the
59:32
pain there as well so like you have a poke comp but they don't know where the opponents are you don't have vision
59:38
control so it doesn't it just kind of does not a lot yeah if they were ahead
59:44
right it's a beautiful SE composition they can come back but this is not going to help as's going to flash to try and
59:50
get out of the way a carrier comes down there's a nice double knock up to come through here and fish's AOE is sizable
59:56
bu there's the crushing more as well and fer answers the attack on his support
1:00:01
now Gideon looking for an opportunity owner goes in and just takes down lens the fear is a little late to save him
1:00:07
but they'll still be able to give another kill over to kingan which I think is a big deal if they want him to be a part of this game oh if only lens
1:00:14
could have just pieced out really good turn there from owner knew he was dead for sure with the rotation coming through but this is the issue like that
1:00:21
play was winning for Nim until you look at the map Faker even teleporting to just guaranteed that this inner goes
1:00:27
down and that's going to again increase that gold lead and bring it back to uh
1:00:35
like the 2K that it was at before yeah two and a half now actually
1:00:40
pushing that money a little bit further ahead there is going to be a rift Herald picked up here by Nim on the top side as
1:00:47
lens finds the wall fish are going to come down here as J is fighting against smash I don't know about this one J he
1:00:53
just shoots and he kills there it is oh oh G Going To Survive thought that e and
1:00:58
hole was actually going to be able to do more there as the repel just to dodge out of the way maybe with one extra item
1:01:04
one finished recipe smash would have been okay I'm not going to lie I think I even with the barrier I thought it was
1:01:10
dead yeah me too like between the the BF Sword and the collector as we take another another look here T1 need to
1:01:17
push forward I think getting L's flash was definitely enough here the fact that I then chase this aggressively was a bit
1:01:24
too much fer is just there ends up doing an incredible amount of damage particular the car owner obvious does
1:01:30
have his zp and then we have the TP come in and then here FL hands just we did
1:01:35
not need to do that sir no no we didn't uh could have just made it out his his
1:01:41
efforts were no longer necessary but the real story is then that T1 immediately responds gets the inner towards the bot
1:01:48
side of the map The Kills are still relevant though and again I I do want to repeat I do think that there is still
1:01:55
good outs for Nim here if they're able to kind of keep the game in this space if they get another Dragon which buys
1:02:00
them a ton of time that could potentially end up making the game a lot harder to play out for T1 and the
1:02:06
scaling on the side of nim is nothing to scoff at T1 also have great late game damage in Victor and Caitlyn especially
1:02:13
but doran's still going to be doing a fair bit of work uh especially with his Hull breaker build I like keeping side Lanes very relevant uh here for T1 that
1:02:21
is going to certainly be that but like you get an aurora with three items as well as a way and an Ezreal like a team
1:02:29
fight won't even happen and you'll be dead what's particularly wayi and Ezreal with limited engage for T1 their pick is
1:02:35
amazing their damage is wonderful and I think the scaling is good but like how do they actually play out the late game
1:02:41
fights without someone to start them in a favorable position for them yeah you
1:02:47
really are going to need to Once Fisher finishes that second item gravity field coming down just trying to turn him
1:02:54
that's going to work but dragon is going to be picked up Nim with control of an area also very scary as far as this
1:03:00
composition is concerned the way they can play it so need to tidy up where they are on the map making sure that
1:03:06
they can actually defend a lot of these key positions that T1 have had a lot of control over but T's going to have to
1:03:12
work even harder than they already have they're going to be able to make sure that this is a guaranteed W don't get me
1:03:18
wrong they're still winning but I'm starting to believe in uh in a bit of the nonan magic they can continue
1:03:25
finding some uh good angles yeah smash even though he's in a great position I think should Inspire more fair and GI
1:03:31
who's seemingly unbothered of course does have a lot of safety with the Asal the big test for Nim is going to be
1:03:37
Theon I think that's where T1 can also get the decisive lead that will knock n shim really out of this game he the gold
1:03:43
lead right now again it's good but it's not going to be enough by itself because trying to get control of Tri brush which
1:03:50
is going to be a necessity into Victor into Elise should be extremely tough
1:03:55
here for the side of nim once T1 sets up there and T's damage I think is pretty
1:04:00
respectable particularly once Faker finishes his second item which I imagine will be the LeAndre so we're going to
1:04:06
have to see T1 if they do get Aon they can turn that into a couple more turrets
1:04:12
cuz the midlane turret Still Standing is actually a big deal yeah and uh pretty
1:04:17
important uh for a as well who does really want to be able to stand here and actually clear waves right it's been je
1:04:23
for most of the game but certainly has has been nice for Nim to allow fer to have some opportunity uh to pick up some
1:04:30
uh some some minions and some money and that is the two item Spike as you indicated to me just then chronicler for
1:04:38
jiu and the Flash Forward that gets the flash out of Faker a very one here forong shim as carrier also possibly
1:04:45
taking more damage than he really wants to right now as kingan's able to get a decent combo onto him and this Aurora
1:04:52
just wasn't doing anything in the early game still 50 CS behind but is still going to be Aurora as it turns out as
1:04:58
this game goes on so have to be a bit scared about what kingan can actually do in a
1:05:04
combo he he has no fear at all this is what we need to see though I think this
1:05:09
is how he does need to play the azreal if noin want to get the win here as long as he doesn't you know get hit by
1:05:16
anything and just and are like it's maybe we found carry Yeah the more you think
1:05:24
about it I think we're still seeing them kind of finding what works for them but that play in the Top Lane yeah you saw
1:05:29
that play that's when the insane mines actually align and that's frightening
1:05:34
Man O I done now for Smash If fer can get us leandre's done as well owner I
1:05:40
imagine also getting close towards that second item Faker gun to back now that might be the opportunity for T1 to pull
1:05:48
that trigger on aacon as Faker actually canceling his back there wanting to
1:05:53
shove out one more wave teleport's going to come in from Fisher now has his Horizon Focus done mhm
1:06:01
so looking for this arakan it is still up and up and available no one's looked at it just yet battle for vision is what
1:06:08
it's kind of feeling like as smash taking this poke damage is pretty good for Nim J
1:06:14
continues to land these W's cuz he's so far up in the lane not going to be able to thread these Mystic shots through
1:06:20
though but you can see he feels the item strength that he has right now collector ie one of the better two item spikes
1:06:26
that you can get for a Caitlyn but it's still two items on Caitlyn kind of want four before you're really happy you're
1:06:33
very happy on one but then it's it's kind of a wait until 30 or4 and then uh
1:06:38
then you're happy again let's ow it's also the ability to actually walk up and
1:06:44
trade is just not being given as that is going to be the mid lane turret actually falling first The Siege power of
1:06:51
nongshim actually rearing its head as Doran able to shove a wave towards that bottom side remember inner turret is
1:06:56
just gone down there as those two turrets that t one have taken one of them included uh an inner okay so bit of
1:07:04
extra money o we have four item SP two item spikes across the board now supports obviously the exception there
1:07:11
is oh dear Kon connects on to King in nice Ace in the Hole just to make sure that he uh has to run away but yeah you
1:07:18
you said it man we've got actually two item spikes on everyone uh except for the sports but they've got one and
1:07:24
that's actually parody as well it's support even yeah it is of course all items are not equal in things like this
1:07:31
but it's kind of cool that we've got two legend for everyone as yeah might it has to be yeah Baker throws this one down as
1:07:37
kinging and after flash does survive though at least for now my goodness what
1:07:43
uh well that was a game of inches it was successful bait as in that the bait got eaten uh but there was no yeah sometimes
1:07:50
the fish just eats it and then uh swims away yeah uh they're not going to an
1:07:55
objective over it but we'll see I think Nim can turn this into the dragon here
1:08:00
it does like T1 I really like this actually cuz Faker does FTP and you do
1:08:06
see Nim obviously with that catch on the top side of the map then want to turn that man Advantage into playing towards
1:08:13
Dragon but then T1 now use this opportunity to rotate over force a response from Nim and like Faker is
1:08:18
going to be back I think that T1 really got the better end of nimir and now they're
1:08:24
spotting Gideon you cannot Dragon my man they are going to start thaton and they're going to be able to get control of this Tri brush no maybe the baade was
1:08:32
successful after all the problem is T1 needs to kill Fisher because if they're actually fighting adakan he's going to
1:08:38
do so much damage to them Doran on a flank angle he's going to have to flash he has to flash as Doran is going to
1:08:45
discover the rest of them Fisher flashes into him I don't know about that one but they do manage to take down Doran because there is that unending despair
1:08:52
or the spiraling despair as it's said it's not actually the item it is the ultimate ability they're just extraordinarily similar so nice little
1:09:00
pickoff here by Nong we'll see whether they'll be able to take the outan themselves looks like the answer is going to be no yeah despair both
1:09:06
unending and spiraling there for Doran he uh the explanation is still the same he gets into the the death chamber
1:09:14
crucially though still not getting an objective uh this though Fisher just in
1:09:19
an awkward position there felt like maybe if Gideon or Nim's team responded a little bit quicker they could have
1:09:25
kept Summoner life because you also can't really walk through the entrance but that is a big cool down that is now
1:09:30
gone I would love it for Nim if they're able to actually set up and it looks like that is going to be the case right
1:09:36
now we do have L and King towards the top side of the map and Doran is up now does T1 want to pull the trigger they
1:09:42
can just call the teleport but I think they're too late that's soul point for Nim Atlas yeah this this Dragon priority
1:09:48
that Nim are putting on I'm really impressed with because that is a real win condition for this team they have so
1:09:54
much damage like is insane and they can hit it without a fight actually starting
1:09:59
so sometimes you've got these dive compositions that do damage very short range they're going they have to go in
1:10:05
to make the damage happen Nim doesn't they just do it speaking of just doing it this aan is just gone yeah so I I
1:10:14
feel like there was a good thing about the dragon and then they had an opportunity to not just give this up but
1:10:19
they they're going to and so arakan is going to be picked up they do not commit to trying to kill them after the goes
1:10:25
down which we've seen a few times this is still a huge deal for T1 they should be able to push up this top side and
1:10:32
we'll see what the strategy is we've seen arakan used in different ways uh here in the lck cup yeah on the life
1:10:40
patch which uh both I think the LPL I think all othero regions are on actually I'm not 100% sure about LTA but
1:10:47
I am about LPL and LC currently on 152 you have to be a lot more respectful cuz it's 200 gold instead of 100 uh we are
1:10:54
not so you do have a lot more Reckless abandon what I imagine T's going to do is just full send it on Baron and as
1:11:01
long as you trade at least a kill or two particularly if it's someone like Doran
1:11:06
that has TP available that's going to be a trait that favors you every single time the only downside is the Poke is so
1:11:13
crazy and not quite the cripp loom done yet not quite yet the third item for GU
1:11:19
but clearing Wards here a little bit Kon going to miss though that means that he will survive in fact the shock blast
1:11:25
becomes lightning everything going to be missing the Big Daddy and so lens's able to keep that health bar pretty high up
1:11:32
Doran going down low as you can see Faker moving over looking for kingan kingan will be able to uh go into
1:11:38
stealth be all right for now and now the way problem is coming in carrier looking for the engage but the Arcane shift out
1:11:44
from jiu is going to help keep him safe lens goes down first though no him they have no right to be here and they are
1:11:50
able to get themselves out thankfully fer has a lot of abilities in fact way too many to remember the names of and
1:11:58
that line of damage not going to be something they want to walk through is now King looking for Faker here as he does a lot but he may also just die as
1:12:06
the ace and the hole threats the needle they do trade never mind they don't trade it because Faker just goes back to
1:12:12
the base for a little while and so that will be the baron over to T1 excellent use of this Aon to guarantee an even
1:12:20
bigger buff and Nong shim just we know how much
1:12:26
T1 love their cuz I'm not going to talk about the baron right the moment the Aon was gone this is what's going to happen
1:12:31
I think that T1 played out nicely but again they they can play with complete Reckless abandoned Faker also does a good job of keeping kingan out of the
1:12:37
fight Nim can't really commit to this even if the he bars are low but I want to talk a little bit because there was
1:12:44
no need I am 100% certain that if both G Gideon and guu as yeah someone should
1:12:50
have taken that yeah probably could have walked definitely could have could have taken that wouldn't have Chang a situation again but definitely should
1:12:57
have but if they W up the moment that that dragon is taken T1 can't Aon and I
1:13:03
think that Aon was the way for team1 to get back now they got Aon now they got Dragon that's why I was celebrating fum
1:13:11
I'm like oh this timing means that they don't give a then they just give it anyway yeah and now I think T1 are
1:13:17
firmly the driver's seat again vision is being denied traps are being set up both Caitlyn traps and vision traps a ton
1:13:25
Vision available here oh look at this yeah this flank W by T is fantastic
1:13:31
they got a Teleport to come in as Gideon does managed to get in there with the ulti flash out though avoids the anchor
1:13:36
and down goes the vi fishion now finds the uh spiraling despair on the carrier
1:13:42
but he's not actually that sad J gets over the wallen's going to be taken down as kingan trying to do some damage here
1:13:48
but Ona gets on top of the Ezreal who flashes away and gets struck by the lightning of this Z and T1 they may just
1:13:56
end just here it's only kingan left alive and there is so much
1:14:02
damage it's not the T1 Baron it's the T1 Aran that does Nim in yeah one little
1:14:09
kill for kingan on the back end but Nexus turrets are now falling smash 100%
1:14:14
win rate here in the lck cup after his third Victory looking absolutely
1:14:20
fantastic over Nong shim in this game number one but I think it was more interesting this game than I was
1:14:26
expecting it to be he did he did lose oh wait no they lost game never mind so he's not 100% win rate but it's a
1:14:32
definable KDA can be in series uh depending on how this one goes because after that
1:14:37
one I really do think that n shame saw a glimpse relaxed for a second and that's
1:14:43
when T1 got them ended up being a T1 Victory here with that Aon call first
1:14:51
one Nim answered well second one they were not ready as we yeah seeing I think you know some
1:14:59
of the mid game calls particularly towards that top side of the map 4 T1 felt a little bit off but you can see
1:15:06
that it wasn't a lot of celebration in the coach's Booth which I think does make some sense yeah um still Nim heads
1:15:12
can still be held high but I think that they had some real moments to make some stuff happen in that game it was a
1:15:19
difficult composition to Pilot but I did see it having some windows they just
1:15:24
weren't able to get there and the tempo was just set too high here by T1 and after what was a really good early game
1:15:31
plan from nongshim the rest of the their game plans and the adaptation wasn't at
1:15:37
that same level and of course T1 and their ability to turn on a dime macro wise is so impressive well you see there
1:15:44
as well the gold is basically even and Nim is sitting assault point in 24 minutes yeah and then Aton is taken and
1:15:49
the game is done yep that's just the end of it you can't afford to give this up T1 they are very aware of that ends up
1:15:56
getting him a good win here in the first game between these two teams atas but we're not going to be seeing any of
1:16:02
these champions again so looking forward to seeing what is going to be prepared by both teams as we head towards game
1:16:09
number two but before that going to be the space after this break

1:22:53
hello everyone and welcome back to the space for the final time here in week two Deon alongside wolf and wiid as T1
1:23:02
take down Nong red force in game number one well that one slow at the start
1:23:07
after first couple of kills but then some decisive macro here by T1 yeah I mean I think the theme of this first
1:23:13
game is definitely T1 really out macroing Nim red Forest Nim have some new players in their lineup right and
1:23:20
they're still figuring out that Synergy and stuff like that but there are some veterans here and I feel like the calls
1:23:25
around some of these objectives were really slow by Nong shim and when you're running into a Caitlyn you're always
1:23:30
going to be a little bit behind the eightball on macro the J Sid Lane with the hole breaker as well was a big problem for them and they just couldn't
1:23:36
actually patch the holes on the map at the beginning of the game uh I think they gave up the turret just for free
1:23:41
and the and then end of the series I think they kind of gave up alaka for
1:23:46
free as well I think that outcome came from their macro play as you mentioned
1:23:52
and also I think the details that T1 had was just great the Elise pick coming out
1:23:57
here for ker let's dive into the early parts of the game here with the turret plates and how it all played out early
1:24:04
on I mean I think smash could just reset here but uh owner kind of gave idea that
1:24:10
he could just push one more wave and I think that kind of managed well uh in a
1:24:15
really good way because after this wave you can speed up uh really fast and you can show a smash pushing out this cannon
1:24:23
W once again while was basing uh I think it was really bad idea to leans to
1:24:30
actually freeze this this way and also not hard pushing with the GU right there
1:24:36
and then actually result of that they had like huge Tempo on them uh on the
1:24:42
Bol Lane so they could actually manage to push out push out the turret while ezer was just pushing slowly on the top
1:24:49
Lane and I think it was really crucial and after that a T1 kind of snowballed all the game really easily by them
1:24:56
getting on the B turret yeah and of course this is first turret which is going to guarantee beats of strength
1:25:02
over to T1 so there's just multifaceted reasons why all the decisions made here
1:25:07
favor T1 massively they utilize the Caitlyn pick incredibly well something T1 has been known for and you could see
1:25:13
I mentioned it when smash was playing in his last series but he's a really good Caitlyn player as well he and Guma both share that treat and uh you know in
1:25:21
situations like this when he set up for Success he does not drop the ball and uh just overall clean play from the rookie
1:25:27
again I love replays like this because it shows how it's a cascading effect
1:25:32
from a decision and the support and like you highlighted earlier smash thought about recalling was given the idea to
1:25:38
continue to push and how it resulted into that first feed of the first tower now let's take a look at some of the
1:25:44
action that we had here in highlight number two where uh at 25 minutes this is some not so great macro and maybe
1:25:51
some decision- making from the opposite ad K jiu yeah is the same for the GU as well he was thinking about the reset
1:25:57
here but he thought about the pushing b w as well but I think it was really bad
1:26:02
choice because atakan respawn I mean atakan spawned on the top side and your
1:26:08
80 Carri is you're pushing on the bo side that doesn't make sense at all if he has teleport which sometimes you take
1:26:14
as as real then you can kind of mess around with this and TP into the fight he doesn't even try to True shot for the steel or anything like that either so he
1:26:21
backs here after canceling his back so he clears a wave doesn't impact the fight at all doesn't get the turret
1:26:28
that's standing down there either and you can see there's definitely I mean I don't know what the Cs are in this moment but my expectation would be
1:26:33
there's either some arguing or disagreeing about what's happening here because you could see J wanted to do something else then decides to back
1:26:39
anyways too late for the fight and those are the kind of calls that need to be much cleaner for norom because against a good macro team like T1 you drop the
1:26:46
ball here you're going to lose the game over it by the way you could easily fix this problem uh if you really wanted to
1:26:51
clear out that b wave you're Israel you could just use your ulti to fix that wave and then get the vision side on the
1:26:58
of the atakan because uh the because of The Nasher it had really narrowed uh
1:27:04
path to the atakan as well so I think it was really important to get the vision control otherwise it's really hard to
1:27:10
walk in uh to the aan pit because of the Caitlin traps and also you are playing
1:27:15
as Elise yeah and up to this point there were no catastrophic mistakes there was no very clear lead but now with that
1:27:22
mistake oton buff on the side of T1 n had the face check into Baron once again you could see the traps and also the
1:27:28
vision control by T1 I mean they even had the atakan but on top of that look at the engage from the carrier it was
1:27:35
phenomenal yeah really nice reaction here from gu but it's just too little too late obviously that engage is what
1:27:41
splits this fight in half so leen's engage means nothing he's cut off as well and that's just it I mean that's
1:27:46
the end of the fight right there off of a great flash play from Cara and that's baren you know there's just no entrance
1:27:51
in King is super low Baker willing to sacrifice himself basically here to guarantee there's no way the Aurora is a
1:27:57
team fight changer and then also weird here that we see the channel from Gideon
1:28:03
towards a already dead Victor who was withdrawing to be fair um instead of blocking that but I guess again just a
1:28:08
little bit chaotic here on the calls for Nim y that's just a difficult difficult one there for Nong shim and they're
1:28:14
going to look back on this one being man we were in it we had the opportunity to get something there weren't quite able
1:28:20
to so T1 up 10 Z Now on nonga red Force look looking to close it on out and
1:28:25
possibly make it a 20 week will they be able to do it let's send it back on over to the casters for game number
1:28:31
two yep looking to make it a 20 week and a 20 game here if they are able to take
1:28:38
the victory here on the red side for T1 so Nim will be able to move over
1:28:46
as oh so we got a Canadian fan in uh the audience here at l park today so welcome
1:28:51
welcome um G I'm providing a little bit of uh translation there it's going to be fun as a MSI this year yeah absolutely
1:28:59
in Canada I've never been to Canada I'd really like to go should talk to someone see whether I can uh I think you'll be
1:29:06
fine uh Max hey don't count your chickens mate you don't count your chickens that's why T1 fans shouldn't be
1:29:11
counting their chickens either just cuz they beat Nim one time doesn't mean this series is over as we are diving into the
1:29:17
draft for game number two and Nim do have the blue shorts that can help out
1:29:22
we've seen blue side beat that little bit more easy to navigate especially here in the draft I always wonder what
1:29:28
leads you to you know wanting to count your chicken so obsessively well I mean
1:29:34
sometimes you lose a chicken and then you go find your chickens and like you really want to have eggs in the morning
1:29:39
right oh yeah that that makes sense exactly and so what if you lose a chicken then you're going to have one less egg and what if you got a big
1:29:46
family and you draw short straws all the time then you're never going to have any eggs man it's a disaster okay we can
1:29:52
work out like a what do you call it the where you give out the the loots loot cycle everyone gets an egg every now and
1:29:57
then you know oh no but like timer for in my family no one's patient enough for that it's just go and get an egg knowing
1:30:04
you I definitely definitely believe that as a pop already taken up the board scarner
1:30:10
absolute no-brainer Champion is quite dumb Cante most likely also going to hit
1:30:16
the table when it comes to the bance as he is still kind of crazy Rumble
1:30:22
probably going to be left open by here to try and pick it early maybe they do a little okay yeah well that I think that
1:30:28
is that is the ban you have to commit to cuz it was ambessa and yon that they also banned I think you can leave those
1:30:35
just get rid of Cante and you're kind of okay with how things are going um you take one of either the y or the ambessa
1:30:41
and then you you go from there maybe you handshake just ambessa into Cante depending on what match up you prefer we
1:30:47
saw DK do that yep true if you're happy to go blue side cassant ban actually
1:30:53
wouldn't that bad but instead they go for the AIA does look like the the trade then right so what does kingan want to
1:30:59
play is it ambessa or is it Cante I'm going to guess Cante I think that champion is just kind of crazy and ab
1:31:05
besta does feel a bit more both play style and team Reliant it's going to be the Leona also taken off the board the
1:31:13
Leona band actually quite interesting means that it sort of deals with lens pretty early on right because the
1:31:19
Nautilus has already taken away so they're sort of his two most pivotal Champions yeah
1:31:24
that's odd maybe raon pryo as well yeah is interesting like do they want to
1:31:31
force out a Jack's pick do you so this works really well with
1:31:37
inessa and with the the Y that are still up and available they could theoretically play both um in this draft
1:31:44
and then jiu can just go into his bag of tricks right this guy plays all sorts of Champions and cassant going to be locked
1:31:51
in no brainer there Doran has been Fant fantastic on this Champion so K is most likely going to
1:31:58
play Ja like maybe Jax and then hope they don't ban zigs I mean the ambessa
1:32:04
uh kante matchup isn't that bad yeah it's also fine so speaking of which that is going
1:32:10
to be looked at here where it's going is an interesting question because it's going to be locked in more likely than
1:32:17
not the ambass is going into the mid lane we did see a time where Cante was a mid lane Champion as well but I don't
1:32:23
know whether it's going to be as popular last time we saw ambessa was actually Fisher playing it and it was a
1:32:29
catastrophe uh the debut of ambessa in competitive play was kesp Cup by Maple
1:32:35
and he won and it was really good so you never know what's going to happen that's a few patches go as well as fer is
1:32:40
considering an an AAR here which would allow for some permafrost Synergy which we're totally into aari Jack is that the
1:32:47
answer kind of feels that way right also allows you to Sil pretty consistently
1:32:53
every time I see see King and hover a gangplank I like I I get butterflies in my
1:32:58
stomach there's a lot of good options here it really just depends on what king and feels comfortable with this does
1:33:04
make smash's life a lot more unfortunate um that is wow it's it's not
1:33:11
nearly as it's like going through all of like the amazing crazy ice cream flavors and then being like nah
1:33:17
vanilla you know and it's just it'll probably get the job done and sajani
1:33:22
Renekton can work but it's doesn't really fill me with joy well it's even like I think really good vanilla gets
1:33:28
kind of a bad rep you know you if you go to really good ice cream place and you get vanilla it's generally exceptional I
1:33:34
don't even feel that way about the Renekton though as we have owner on Lilia I think owner had an exceptional
1:33:41
game number one on the Zino his performance on the champion I think has always been just insanely consistent to
1:33:49
the point where teams have started preparing counter picks the last year spring KX counter pick
1:33:56
he like owner as AP it's not eveny thing it's just how T1 looks you know T1 I
1:34:04
think relies on him so much for the space he creates and the power he has when he decides to go in not going to
1:34:10
have access to that this time around but it is a really strong pick at the moment we've seen Lucid have P wory
1:34:16
performances of it and it's also annoying to play into a sichani because you just get outpaced pretty aggressively and it's hard to outside of
1:34:23
you know if you have backup and a combo to 100 to zero her actually locking her down consistently is just kind of a
1:34:30
nightmare yep and uh We've sparked a little bit of a debate uh in the chat about uh the Vanilla Ice Ice Cream Co
1:34:37
nothing against it in fact Renekton great Champion there just could have been more interesting things there could
1:34:43
have been more flavor yeah could have just been a bit more off the- wall that's what we're saying so what is your
1:34:48
favorite what is your favorite ice cream flavor coffee that actually tracks yeah yeah like or like a good tiramisu but I
1:34:55
don't know tiramisu ice cream yeah tiramisu ice cream is never had absolutely but isn't that just coffee
1:35:00
with extra steps exactly uh it's coffee and alcohol basically smash thinking about what he
1:35:06
wants to lock in we've got the ash varus handshake as well as the alist and the ranata um alista being probably the next
1:35:13
rung on uh Len's list of Champions that are good and then the ranata being uh carrier's you know the champion that you
1:35:20
just really don't want to see carrier on if you are the opposition and you want to win smash thinking about Jinx though this is certainly a great pick for him
1:35:26
he has found so much success in his career on this Champion that will be locked in provides them a fair bit of range not a whole lot of peel with this
1:35:34
composition that's oh I was about to say they're definitely going to go in further do think you want to Lane swap
1:35:40
here if you are n shim because the early laning pH is not fun cuz you get outraged so
1:35:45
aggressively and there's also not a lot of engage supports but re is still open
1:35:52
so there's also no all that oh I am not it's so they're going
1:35:57
to lock Z raan right and then they to take away to raan from K A lot of the counters are taken away I'm not I don't
1:36:04
like it get me first and foremost but I can see the fall process because ker was going to play raan you can't play Leona
1:36:10
you can't play poppy you have to Blind something like I guess you could blind maai is it Blitz crank I've seen that
1:36:15
L's face before yeah that's what I was thinking as well don't blind Blitz okay this is fine this is fine no it's not fine why would you not look to raan
1:36:23
there's nothing fine about what Nong shim just did first they hard countered themselves J just locks in the champion
1:36:30
that you pick Jinx into and then they don't even do the thing that you're supposed to pick it
1:36:37
for you could play re with anyone Misfortune would have been AOK okay well
1:36:42
Atlas I was kind of upset about the fact that you didn't ask me what my favorite flavor of ice cream was but now upset about this what's your favorite flavor
1:36:48
of ice cream please take me away from talking about this uh mango oh really go yeah interesting love mango ice cream
1:36:54
would you like more of a sorbet or like an ice cream ice cream no not cuz for sorbet my favorite flavor is actually
1:37:01
lemon yeah mine too like the classic you can't I mean it's going back to the it's
1:37:06
it's going back to the the whole vanilla thing but I do think lemon so is so so good yeah you speaking of Lulu and Jinx
1:37:14
in a lane against uh Z and real oh I don't think they're going to be laning as as one another but then you still win
1:37:19
because you have Cante in the lane swap yeah and they have Renekton yeah wow I I was I was feeling the N
1:37:28
shim draft and I feel like particularly in F I've had we've had a lot of these where you see the first three you're like feeling pretty good as some base
1:37:35
Nim fans you love to see that yeah uh that is very cool I I am worried about
1:37:42
you know the rate of and I think it's okay like if you're looking at the king in half of the draft like so those those
1:37:48
fans absolutely happy about how things are going and that guy is's just a chill guy so it's it everything is not
1:37:55
bothered either I'm very bothered and you heard like I I don't often let my emotions get the better of me um don't
1:38:01
you I mean I try not to um but that was I I I apologized for the Outburst but it
1:38:07
bothered me I felt like things were going a relatively okay Direction and then um they were going and now they are
1:38:14
no longer going they are not going we just have to see how it does work out here because of course Nim they still
1:38:19
have a fair bit of tools and there is a lot of melee outside of the Jin that you can utilize this Z to try and
1:38:27
alleviate yourself but I just I just don't know whether it was the greatest choice on the line maybe they can prove
1:38:32
us [Music]
1:38:42
[Music] wrong all right let's get into it let's see whether the Nim can show us
1:38:48
something that we weren't expecting and by we I mean me and chronicler at at least I'm sure there's some of you in
1:38:55
the uh in the chat and here at L Park perhaps that just know jiu has a plan
1:39:01
and his first part of the plan is by picking ghost which is fun gets to run a bit more
1:39:07
quickly got some backs coming on through on some Wards which makes me a little bit frightened given the location of
1:39:14
lens right now owner is not aware I do not think no he was was just backing on
1:39:20
a ward yeah never mind okay so so he's aware of everything so they they do know
1:39:25
oh T setting it it's plans within plans baits within baits and now they are
1:39:31
going to Cascade on top of Nong shim oh lens with some fancy footwork there
1:39:38
actually able to get out does have to expend a lot and now carrier flashing over this wall preemptively to make sure
1:39:45
that fisher is going to die to smash ladies and gentlemen on okay never mind maybe he won't J is going to turn up and
1:39:52
there's the Flash Forward from smash gets the flash finally out of fer jiu might be the one that play pays for his
1:39:58
sins or at least he going to have to go back home so they survive ladies and gentlemen no First Blood goes down but
1:40:05
it is still an absolute disaster Atlas they they technically survive but you know if you're if you're surviving cuz
1:40:12
you find some water in the desert but you're still in the desert and and and you you have no way out yeah did you
1:40:19
really survive cuz I'm not feeling very alive here if you're Nong shim and also
1:40:24
wasn't actually able to go back as well asens crashing down it's it's just a
1:40:31
disaster yeah this this was not the early game that uh you were hoping for as lens is going to spot owner out and
1:40:38
he's going to wonder when things are supposed to get oh he passive stacked yeah sure Ste doesn't get back he's
1:40:46
still going to die ladies and gentlemen that is going to be smash finally finishing it off there's First Blood shout out to Reckless there with The
1:40:53
Fanatic he did it at the end last meanwhile we have ambassa versus the mid Zia
1:41:01
which I I mean J also isn't very happy about that because he doesn't have any early threat and if Essa gets on top of
1:41:08
him he just kind of gets dumped Fisher now gets back to Lane well gets to Lane for the first time yeah well gets back
1:41:14
to a lane I don't know adlas this this early game is rough uh what okay so what
1:41:20
went better what went better the the second half of the draft or the early game for
1:41:26
Nim probably second half of the draft cuz we got to talk about ice cream I feel like and that wasn't talking about
1:41:33
the the thing okay yeah that was that wasn't talking about that there's also the fun and engaging conversation of
1:41:38
this game keep going the way it is about what's your favorite combo of ice cream which is a whole mother thing o uh
1:41:44
because I well I mean I I gave you my top two so I mean okay but you don't oh
1:41:49
yes you do oh so you just slant the G ter you you're like so I think there there are
1:41:55
different people there are people that like Gideon is get canell on his red buff smash is here again he didn't
1:42:06
die kingan doesn't even have TP Lulu's going to murder him is he just
1:42:12
going to get like look at PX the PX damage even the co the meek carry is not Meek he's looking for it finds the auto
1:42:20
and the Flash was used as well find me some good noodle news please someone as
1:42:28
T1 are finding everything they want on this map 1,000 gold the lead at 4 and 1/2 minutes the problem on top of that
1:42:36
is that this is so much money into smash he's the one that got the first Blood he
1:42:41
has a huge lead and he's jinx it doesn't get
1:42:48
better I the noodles are burned Atlas yeah I want to go back to talking about the ice cream thing I I had a whole
1:42:54
philosophical conversation to have is now King and slicing and Dyson trying to get underneath this turret he will make
1:43:00
it there and lens is going to be able to help him out as well oh
1:43:06
man oh dear me let's have a look at this from carer's perspective as he just goes
1:43:11
and he kills King the Dodge of the C was the that was the big end kill right because without
1:43:20
that he gets a heal up and sometimes you just got to flash
1:43:26
early you know really have to cuz car didn't have flash yeah I mean he would have lived
1:43:33
but he still would have flashed away from aulu as a re it would have it would have
1:43:39
would have felt bad well Not only would it have felt like a defeat it would be a defeat but it would be better dying
1:43:45
without TP and using flash anyway so the one upside for Nong shim and I'm I'm really
1:43:53
kind of kind of stretching it here but Doran you know uh the Nexus is alive
1:44:00
yeah Doran did have to walk back to Lane cuz he didn't have TP CU of the weirdo
1:44:05
situation and kingan was just farming away happily so they do have a little bit of a gold Le there and maybe this is
1:44:11
T1 who now gets over confident and over invest BL them into a false sense of
1:44:16
security Chronicle yeah uh oh that's that's no no no no cut the video cut the
1:44:22
video we don't look at the bottom Lane um there is fisher making his way over there no teleport for him as Faker is
1:44:28
just going to dive on top of L and L's going to have to crash F I thought he was going to get him but he doesn't want
1:44:34
to risk it does not want to get overconfidence which is understandable oh dear Fisher about to get the perfect
1:44:41
execution um by hitting another level so it is just two flavors of
1:44:46
coffee yeah basically so what I was going to say is there are like two types
1:44:51
of people there are people that like the combination of the flavors and then there's people that just like this thing
1:44:57
and then like another thing and they put them together you know and I'm I'm kind of the second one I'm pretty basic when
1:45:03
it comes want more of the same no no no no it's not the same flavor it's like I just go my top two things that I can see
1:45:09
in front of me okay but it's the same thing it's both coffee no it's not one's tiu one's coffee they're very different
1:45:15
okay fair enough um but otherwise yeah I'd just get more coffee if there was no turu
1:45:22
cost alongside you long enough to know that you always go for more coffee I feel like you're a little bit more like cultured you know like you'd like oh
1:45:29
well I think that this complement this other flavor yeah no yeah so for example when I have the mango ice cream I'm
1:45:35
really like to couple it with like something else like a yogurt Rasberry have you mango raspberry yeah that's
1:45:42
that's a that's a classic combo you know you can go out of tropical flavors can not look at transpiring here
1:45:49
oh get look at the adorable no man and he's fallen asleep hopefully he was
1:45:56
asleep when he went down as Carri was able to tank up the turret another beautiful dive orchestrated here by is
1:46:02
level three it it just it it really does not
1:46:08
it does not get much worse than this as far as uh Nim's experience in this early game oh he's Lev four now shut out the
1:46:15
shut out that T1 have put down in this one is kind of absurd there's no playing the game at from this point on unless T1
1:46:21
makes a colossal mistakes this game unfortunately is
1:46:26
just your only win con is I guess the aali which isn't as far behind as we
1:46:32
take another look here look at how much gameplay King gets to even Dodges that but then he gets polymorphed which means
1:46:37
he doesn't have any counterplay oner gets the que takes a turret shot but who cares and the I think the chomp has also
1:46:44
made sure that like he just actually never had he just doesn't get to play the game he doesn't have Flash so it's not like he can even if he flashes
1:46:50
doesn't matter cuz smash just Waits out there we go carrier might die
1:46:56
that what no no that is a oh thank God
1:47:03
oh my goodness and I it's not that we wanted carrier to die there in any way
1:47:08
but that would have been too much Nong shim would not have been able to cope if that hadn't been an actual pick all
1:47:15
right right we get Cara right fer he's going to kill smash he gets the E he's going to go in okay
1:47:23
back flip that was a bit weird but that's okay no Lulu's there it's he gets
1:47:29
it he gets it that's two that's two that's two that's two yeah carry is only level five so he doesn't have the wild growth couldn't actually give him alive
1:47:34
is now King and able to stun up fakey here Fisher is very dead just DOD
1:47:41
DOD oh it's so playable atas oh we are so bad it's so bad it's not actually uh
1:47:47
don't get us wrong uh this is still doomed in a half uh as Doran able to uh pretty
1:47:53
sit underneath this turret Atlas yes we just need to get more delusional anything
1:47:59
can need to believe I'm not ready uh as we watch carrier almost make the imagine
1:48:06
if he had have escaped here like I think you would have seen the surrender vote come up overconfidence is a slow and
1:48:13
Insidious killer as dulu just walks in alone with no pryo I guess to get a little bit of mid lane pryo and then
1:48:19
here this is actually really well done by fer doesn't have his old or Flash cuz he had to use it but both canceling the
1:48:26
recall there I can't believe he actually has enough damage to take him down here even with smash I think Smash Flash
1:48:31
knowing that car was there car on the verge yeah funn enough maybe should like
1:48:37
maybe the play there was to heal earlier so you're in range for a shield but that's hindsight yeah
1:48:43
that's that was a while ago now we will have a possible fight here
1:48:49
and if if if Nim just slam another one of these now there is old for car and
1:48:54
smash has Glenn so this might be a bit of a hard one oh at least going to go even on grubs there we go if they get
1:49:01
all of these then they're actually uh capable of getting towards a feet of strength perhaps the they has moved up
1:49:09
kingan's moved down though Faker looking for the old all right that's going to be the secure by Gideon so that is a feat
1:49:15
of strength or at least almost a feat of string as Doran yeah perfect execution
1:49:21
is named weirdly here uh on the bottom side of the map but will allow Fisher to
1:49:26
escape Atlas we are we are on the verge of playable 2K gold deficit at 11 and a
1:49:31
half you are really buying into actually commentating a video game here aren't you I need to I don't know I can't just
1:49:37
keep talking about ice cream I need to do my job at least a little bit okay hear me out if it goes back to a free 4K
1:49:42
gold lead put find ice cream want cuz I think we also haven't really touched upon what if you want like a Hardy
1:49:48
flavor versus a fruity flavor ooh that's true so we can hold on to that is King is solo killing Faker No flashes left as
1:49:56
Faker gets himself out but the Renekton still know what it says on the
1:50:01
T tell we're not going to be talking about ice cream no we're going to bring us back and we're going to get a game number three okay well it's leaning to the
1:50:09
delusion Chronicle is over there doing something um we're here in reality and
1:50:14
we're feeling like life is still pretty difficult for Nim as Doran eats the CC very comfortably doesn't have all out
1:50:21
but I don't know whether he needs it as king very nice on the slice he will be able to make it out to safety all right
1:50:27
one item spikes are done now for T1 we have both the I Throne Gauntlet the eclipse done taker not having sums will
1:50:34
definitely make the next fight a little bit harder could have an opportunity for Nim to keep
1:50:40
themselves on a pretty decent pace to bring back this game if they can deny this Dragon okay if they get hex tech
1:50:48
Drake I'm back in the game with you you're not yet not yet they need a dragon
1:50:53
I think that's fair fer doesn't have his ultimate just yet but does have his rocket belt now at the ready and T1 for
1:51:01
how well they've been playing it's still a jinx composition on only a single item so maybe there's an opportunity here and
1:51:08
they have still a whole lot of Peel like we were talking about takes a lot of his health in damage okay get in this is
1:51:14
your moment uh they can let it go and they would have to invest King and CP as well with doran's ro over so I don't
1:51:20
think that this was necessarily bad call as it is the ocean Rift gracing us and
1:51:26
kingan is actually going to get a good amount of gold from pedal pedal pedal pedal why would you not why would you not just hit it just
1:51:33
once what ped right there it's like the Cinders all over again if orx is
1:51:40
watching he is also fuming right now it's free stats and not just for you
1:51:46
yeah it's the whole team oh man all right well not going to be getting those maybe King in like it's
1:51:52
a Gentleman's Agreement like it's on T1 side of the map and T's not taking any from their side of the map as well but I
1:51:59
don't know whether that is real in any way as all right fu is going to be dashing around nice shuriken back flip
1:52:05
connect there from fer stops the back that might be the greatest reward for that whole situation flash available for
1:52:11
Fisher not for Faker as they are fighting once again there's the flash magnet storm the ulti
1:52:17
comes through to buy some space here for Faker and the back flip connects oh you felt the Fisher wanted it but he was
1:52:23
definitely going to die oh actually I think that with that ult Faker also dodged the first half of the AAL
1:52:30
ultimate and he got a little bit of a dash there while locking down the hands so actually really nice done I think if he doesn't hit that all might not be
1:52:37
able to get out with his life so good save there cuz fer is definitely going to be the main Wing con that Nim are
1:52:43
currently looking toward and then hopefully scale into gu One V ning at some point uh the range disadvantage
1:52:49
plus the fact that there's a Lulu on the enemy team is something that we're going to have to you know deal with as we go
1:52:55
but at least Faker is being kept on the back foot another push possibility there
1:53:01
for Nim who do have five grubs so if they can get a little bit of time alone with these turrets and try and look
1:53:07
further might have to flash here at least use his ult wow that
1:53:13
is oh he's locked nerves of Ste yeah I I mean he didn't even press ghost like I'm
1:53:20
kind of wondering if he shouldn't have but there's no objective up so realistically the wave is a bit
1:53:25
unfortunate in all chat wanted to back anyway he would he
1:53:31
would I think GI is the same as me think this game is winable I don't know why you guys are getting so I hope so I hope
1:53:37
that's the way Nim think no but I'm talking every Pro Player will always think that but I'm talking in your heart
1:53:43
of hearts ah yes yes yes oh Gideon oh dear well owner is going to turn up he's
1:53:49
running real quick as Gideon looking to try and get out of the way bowling ball goes wide because of that they actually
1:53:55
had an angle there yeah Nim like they're on the map now and they're behind by
1:54:00
2,000 gold which is a lot but that's the same as last game and we were kind of
1:54:05
talking about last game as being maybe I'm in it with you I'm in it with you with you we're loed in we're doing it
1:54:10
it's a real video is on a flank they are unaware we got spotted here oh God not
1:54:16
the same spot oh dear oh dear it's a different board but it's the same traa I've seen this before as is going to
1:54:22
slow him down speed himself up they turn they're going to look for it as now owner is just going to kill lens so lens
1:54:29
is really dead but is he actually going to be able to get out with his life that's the question no tag on a shuriken there as Faker is on a ward fer still
1:54:36
wanting it wanting to find an opportunity meanwhile Doran is just you know unaware of the funny business
1:54:43
that's going on on the top side of the map he's just doing his best to win the game that is kind of working out here
1:54:48
unbothered was Doran who's just like I can just push I can TP we need to but he clearly
1:54:54
didn't they got cleanse and heal which is something I think that's actually
1:55:00
what allowed them to get away from Gideon and was looking for an engage
1:55:05
fact that lens get spotted not exactly in the same spot but in the same area and it kind of Falls to play again is a
1:55:11
bit unfortunate and it also means owner is getting furthere we haven't really talked about Lilia this much and
1:55:18
I as I've uh mentioned many times I think owner on a AP jungler junglers
1:55:23
even if he looks good individually just doesn't always feel like he's able to play as proactively which I think T1
1:55:29
really relies on on this Lilia I'm seeing none of those issues Lilia I think is a different breed as well like I think oh yeah compared to like brand
1:55:36
oh we're seeing it in play here right because you do actually have the opportunity to set up plays for the rest of your team and he is also the sole AP
1:55:43
source so itemizing against this guy is actually kind of a nightmare there a Flash there which I think is good giving
1:55:49
Fisher a shutdown would be a really good way for Nong shim to try
1:55:54
I I don't even want to say get a grasp on the game cuz I feel like we're a couple of plays off of that but at least
1:55:59
be allowed to play the game again cuz now it's uh almost 3 and a2k as we have
1:56:04
a coming back flank and if if at first you don't succeed in finding a flank
1:56:09
angle just go for it again did did he al already he did Al yes there's a turret okay well if if a Reon ults in in where
1:56:17
no one can see at all well as it turns out did um
1:56:23
it filled up his rage bar though as we can see they get Vision on Carrier here
1:56:29
as now lens he's driving let's see what can happen here as the glacial prison
1:56:35
goes entirely wide owner is in trouble nice wild growth but it's not going to be enough there as they manage to take down the tur but not before Doran makes
1:56:42
his way in fake is there as well you got The All Out is the public execution going to be employed the answer is yes
1:56:47
but it does not land and Nim it's a one for one they take a turret you call it a
1:56:53
trade up I guess you get the shut down that's that's worth un ironically that's not that bad a trade the problem is that
1:56:59
they're probably going to lose their own mid lane and they might lose fiser as well who's inside the Shroud but that will wear off eventually doran's health
1:57:06
bar isn't infinite as smash did not want to tank that turret shot as well and they run out of Minion wave Nong shim
1:57:13
able to breathe a sigh of relief so not going to get the turret most likely they are going to give up the Dragon for this
1:57:19
but it's only a second dragon as I want to take another look so even with kingan not able to find in the old going wide
1:57:26
oh fish with that flash was also I guess it worked so he like flashed to get to the wall and then eat over huh I feel
1:57:33
like there was a more elegant way to do that without having to invest flashing over the wall and then using the E for damage could have been good uh yes would
1:57:39
have been preferable they got the damage nonetheless uh but he could yeah could have just held on to his flash or maybe
1:57:47
they could have gotten another member as lens is again Behind Enemy Lines at this point I think T1 going to be remotely
1:57:53
surprised he knows he knows that he's been walking over Wards and like getting into awkward situations all game and so
1:58:00
he trolls us when he does it again on a control W oh so what he's trying to clog up the so lens yeah it is very lens
1:58:08
yeah not ideal for winning the game although Atlas it's 20 minutes in it's
1:58:14
only a 2 and 1/2k deficit that's The Sweet Spot game number one was almost play it's turned into a video game it
1:58:22
really has I think I think you were right you were absolutely righton up and available us and the viewers at home it
1:58:30
might have been helped by the ice cream conversation I actually think you did you did good work there because people
1:58:36
probably wanted to hear more about ice cream but now the game's got in the way as Faker is also just going to dive on
1:58:42
top of D who does have to use his feather storm he Dodges the damage of those feathers and fake is out of there
1:58:48
he's like a rap as now kingan looking for smash or smash looking for him super mega Death rocket connects onto Fisher
1:58:54
he doesn't get the shuriken and so kingan will be going down and Gideon now
1:58:59
slowed down by this bowling ball that does way too much damage over time that's Aon yeah no they I think that is
1:59:07
an unanswerable no no no there is an answer actually pivot back to ice cream oh yeah uh yeah Aon Aon I don't I I it's
1:59:15
it's at this point it feels kind of overdone but that's Aon gone trade for a dragon second ocean
1:59:22
Drake there isn't really anything that can be done as Faker does take a little bit too much damage it it was him that
1:59:28
set up the play though gets the old onto G and then crucially also Dodges the pullback of the feathers with the embes
1:59:33
some ability using the passive very nicely Baker actually having a really
1:59:39
good Amba game I think the fights have been played well I think in Lane there were a couple of couple of more awkward
1:59:45
situation but this is really good right finds G forces out e on and that a dash
1:59:51
I was talking about because otherwise he dies there was a three stack his first Dash dodged the glacial prison and the
1:59:58
second one dodged the feathers yeah not bad so really well done by the fight there King unfortunately this time he
2:00:04
gets his o amongst people but uh there there's too many so he still doesn't get the value that they've been dreaming of
2:00:10
and now Aon is here T won have card blanch do whatever they want for the next minute and 50 seconds and as we
2:00:19
said all that no got was just an ocean Drake yeah they at least get it so it's
2:00:25
has two items if he gets a third yeah uh where gank and Faker in a side lane when
2:00:31
Faker cannnot die and the rest of his team are coming over Fisher if you reveal yourself you are condemning
2:00:38
himself to death but he didn't nice can't believe no one is checking that brush are they going to like G is still
2:00:45
there as well are they going to go for the Deep SL oh god oh they are well
2:00:50
let's see what they can do here as je is at least able to avoid the public execution and no shim they decide better
2:00:57
of it and I do not blame them as hens he could just be all outed here it's a
2:01:03
decent magnet storm to buy some time from Gideon he books it and Dives
2:01:08
underneath as T1 are now trying to back themselves away I think it might still be a rough time for noin but Gideon
2:01:15
makes it out and there is another ticket home here for Doran as well oh Fisher
2:01:22
hit that e maybe that would have been an opportunity double teleports Faker goes into the mid lane and Doran is going to
2:01:27
come back up once again the sleepies come down as owner is likely to die
2:01:33
never mind actually the turret just goes down and owner is still alive 30 seconds until this outon buff goes down again as
2:01:39
fer at least gets himself 100 gold but they'll lose an inhibitor for it that's two so maybe he's almost got a kills
2:01:45
worth of money here but if he dies then that's actually a huge deal not going to but the inhib will still fall
2:01:52
and T1 retain that strangle hold on this game could have been worse Atlas I mean that's kind of what I'm thinking B Lane
2:01:58
in it went down maybe we do yeah we do a TP flank why not oh 4 seconds cuz we can kill Doran smash can't die smash can die
2:02:06
now cuz the buff just wor off Ed out yeah fer is going to look for the angle here melee range with a manalus jinx
2:02:14
seems somewhat doable as he flashes in to execute smash permafrost being used
2:02:20
for what feels like the first time in this game as well both keeping Doran alive for way too long and oner has so
2:02:26
much AOE damage it is disgusting and now Faker is coring them the hens is at
2:02:33
death door as J is just trying his best to be alive in this situation another
2:02:39
pack of feathers are just going to do nothing as it's a triple for owner as he just ties up Nong shim somehow it's lens
2:02:47
that's the last man standing um but I don't know whether that really really matters at all T1
2:02:53
moved to a 6,000 7,000 gold lead and the base is in
2:02:59
tatters I was really excited to be excited but unfortunately uh ended up not quite panning out GI gets his flash
2:03:06
or his old Force very early on here and then T1 feels safe to engage and Dora or
2:03:12
lands because they have the buff but it's Gideon with the long con actually waiting for like what a full minute
2:03:19
there that ends up getting Behind Enemy Lines which forces a response and that alone doesn't really kill anyone but
2:03:25
Doran doesn't have any backup as a result cuz they have to deal with the San that's in their midst and then here
2:03:31
the fact that smash actually stays alive for as long as he does between the shield from Cante and then this I want
2:03:37
you to look at this right here the fact that Doran gets that Dash up and then stays alive for as long as he does
2:03:42
that's what ends up winning the fight cuz that's what set up a multi man even Faker missing his all doesn't end up
2:03:48
mattering because they're able to get on top and this is the dream scenario for Lilia right so many rotations you can
2:03:54
get off you're not under any threat at all and yeah they end up getting a kill there Cara ends up going down but it
2:04:01
just doesn't really matter is Doran um is is he in trouble or is I don't know
2:04:07
who's in trouble I think nimmer in trouble is now fer is looking for an angle he's spotted on a ward Magnus Storm's there as super mega Death rocket
2:04:14
also helping out with the AOE owner turns up though and fer is out of there hasn't actually offered any damage to
2:04:20
this fight as now King and desperately trying trying to stay alive and keep Faker away but Gideon's down and smash
2:04:26
gets excited understandably so with a jungle looking as good as owner is right
2:04:31
now it must be pretty nice being on T1 81 and zero on this Lilia three items
2:04:39
complete oh my good he's just a monster both games atas his Z was also
2:04:47
kind of crazy oh yeah and showing his performance on what it really is feeling
2:04:53
like one of the stronger jungl at the moment particularly with Fearless continuously oh he got an ice cream I
2:05:00
love that wait is that a coffee iceu icea probably oh it looks pretty good can I have one what oh that is you know
2:05:10
what I was tempted to storm off but I'm not going to I'm kind of interested in how decid I I there's not a lot of game
2:05:17
to be played you you can it's 10k gold it's fine go go no I you know
2:05:22
go get go get that ice still there like a last fight if it was coffee I know it was that was the problem that's so mean
2:05:31
I know as the deficit here unfortunately way too big the interesting thing that we haven't really gotten to look at yet
2:05:36
is seeing how the Jinx Works in this composition you have a front line that there so much damage available to the
2:05:42
ambessa and the Lilia set up from the cassan so Jinx doesn't really get threatened and outside of an aali flank
2:05:49
which I think Lulu Answers Pretty handily why are youing stop this stop putting
2:05:55
him there so mean it looks delicious it is I'm I'm also trying to
2:06:02
do keto at the moment I I can never eat that I just can't eat
2:06:08
that I want the mini map back give me the mini map thank you don't need the mini map I need the mini map that's okay
2:06:16
first inhibitor I think there was an inhibitor went down there was a beautiful Captain Jack there from Smash as he avoids the glacial prison some
2:06:23
Redemption to keep them all alive again but it's Nim that need redemption in this game and they are not going to get it fish looking for a backline as smash
2:06:30
takes a bit of damage and then proceeds not to care at all about the situation while growth is going to be used and he
2:06:37
will actually be taken down we all know the real carry was in fact owner and
2:06:42
kingan now just using the fountain to keep his health bar a little bit higher as they are losing health bars on T1
2:06:49
side maybe dealing with this Nexus T could be a good idea The Flash polymorph comes in to make sure that jiu can't get
2:06:54
any more worked up but he's still kind of doing it and now on throwing these bowling balls around King and keeping
2:07:00
himself up here as Doran will be a to take that one carer just wants it wants to try and find the kill but he doesn't
2:07:07
get it in the end and T1 will take down Nong shim 2 to zero here in our first
2:07:13
match of the day the final day of this week and the first one uh the last one before solal does kick off our national
2:07:21
holiday for the Luna new year is going to be a whole lot of fun especially for T1 and T1 fans because they get to go
2:07:27
into it off the back of a big win and you can see Nim game number one I think
2:07:32
they had the game in a position where they realistically could have had a great shot at winning game number two
2:07:38
that one was kind of over from the beginning I know that they found some great opportunities and credit to their
2:07:44
fighting Spirit but after that level one particularly against a team like T1 realistically it was always going to be
2:07:50
an incredible uphill battle as grou Baron avoid a certain demise now are the
2:07:58
alt grade no but that doesn't matter we're going to keep if they keep winning forever and honestly group Baron going
2:08:06
20 today is probably like that's the
2:08:11
accepted outcome right cuz we've got bro playing after this I don't even care who their opposition is I don't even
2:08:17
remember who it is unbel you would do this against KT no I mean oh it's KT wow
2:08:23
guaranteed wait no that works for KT oh God what do you have to say in order to
2:08:30
help bro win there are too many layers and you know what that's not even the worst part the worst part is I found out Emily Rand didn't know about the
2:08:36
existence of mango ice cream wow really which is like a whole another thing uh so now we have everything ice cream
2:08:42
can't you just put anything into ice cream basically based ice cream yeah great ice cream's delicious oh this was
2:08:48
like a winter Ro it was amazing absolutely incredible smash had another
2:08:53
amazing set of games here didn't really get to Showcase it nearly as much I think as you would expect given how
2:09:00
these games played out Faker uh was that that was like I know this isn't the lck
2:09:07
so we didn't get the graphic but that was another unique Champion I'm pretty sure we haven't uh we haven't seen him
2:09:12
pull out added to the list Atlas yep we will what is it like 80 90 150 I don't
2:09:18
know if you include his stream he's played every Champion so there you go uh we're going to have a look at some of the highlights here and I'm still
2:09:26
reeling from the draft I'm actually mainly uh distracted by how angry a Deon
2:09:31
I am um but the draft was really rough and then nongshim this early game didn't
2:09:38
go the way they wanted and then they were kind of heroic right they made it into a video game again and then Ona
2:09:46
decided to say no it's not actually it really to me feels like Nim are
2:09:52
just a couple of weeks away from actually being a good like I'm starting to see the pieces kind of Click into
2:09:57
place yeah right and T1 is still one of the best teams that we have with the lck even with the the changes that have come
2:10:03
through right taking out zaas putting Doran back in now uh in the LK cup
2:10:08
currently playing with smash as well it feels like T1 is slowly getting back to what we expect from them but for no you
2:10:16
can see how this how this team is supposed to work I think that fisher actually had as good of a performance on
2:10:21
the akali as you can have that flash non withstanding after his yeah really rough start I think the team fighting from gu
2:10:29
this is what I wanted to see I think in 2024 I didn't see a lot of the G that I that I was missing from the year before
2:10:36
but thus far the complete lack of fear even in this game I think he only ended up dying once which is a pretty big
2:10:42
achievement given how it laid out I agree I still would have much preferred to see a Kaiser or something like that
2:10:49
instead of going for this desire angle we're having a listen to T1 as
2:10:56
they take down n got a little bit dicey towards the very end because uh D did keep himself very very safe and smash
2:11:03
did die but uh then Ona was yeah like a a 10 in one Lilia with
2:11:09
all of the items in the universe and was just just kind of bamb beinging around having a good time we've
2:11:15
had a lot of split votes I don't think this is going to be one of those I this one feels like kind of a Noak
2:11:22
who else would it be I think carrier probably gets a few votes I think his performance on the Elise was
2:11:28
fantastic he got that solo kill on King yeah but he also dieda there's a couple of moments where
2:11:36
I don't get me wrong I think he had a amazing performance also I love I love battle Lulu Atlas it's just I know we
2:11:43
don't get in Solo Lanes anymore but it's just so annoying that's fun to watch
2:11:48
it's it reminds me of when you know Faker was playing Lulu every single game and abely deci Lulu oh God yeah what was
2:11:56
the worst I think the worst Top Lane L Top Lane cuz it was just about anti fun dying twice in the entire series here
2:12:04
making sure that he can Divi Define the kdas to a 10 and a 12 brilliant
2:12:09
performance here from owner well-deserved player of the match could be unanimous might be a smattering of
2:12:14
others but I'm with you I think that uh this was the no-brainer choice and owner just going from strength to strength man
2:12:20
this guy is just getting better and better really good love to see it yeah owner is particularly internationally I
2:12:28
think has been kind of a main state but domestically bit of ups and down so seeing played as well it's always good
2:12:33
to see very early in the year as well which is fantastic it's now time to hear from him as well so let's throw over to the
2:12:41
interview thank you very much guys this is deer for the lck cup P interview translation joined by owner on the side
2:12:47
of T1 with T's Victory group Aon keeps its hopes alive how do you
2:12:55
feel I'm glad that we're able to keep its hop alive and this is our last match before
2:13:02
the holiday and being able to end it with a victory is also
2:13:08
great let's talk about game one the enemy gave you trouble with the long
2:13:14
range con so what was the game plan to deal with
2:13:19
that right after game one we did talk about how it was really hard and tough regarding the
2:13:26
draft and yeah it was really the range fight that gave us
2:13:31
trouble but we really did play with the mindset that as long as we get the macro
2:13:37
down and get control over the game that it would be able to will be winable and in game two you got ahead up the enemy
2:13:45
to ultimately carry your team to Victory and as an Engaged Champion does zilia need to position certain way any tips
2:13:53
for team fight positioning I think it really depends on whether you have Zas
2:13:58
or not and I think with zonas it's really easy to engage and go in and without zonas yeah Lilia is a really
2:14:05
easy Champion to die with so I think it really is dependent on whether you have Zas or
2:14:12
not if group Elder wins one more time they will be the winner did you know
2:14:19
that but you need to fight until the very end so what message do you have for the next
2:14:26
Baron team OK Savings Bank Bon you know it would be really nice if you guys can
2:14:31
win but even if you lose I think we'll just individually have to do well but
2:14:37
despite that I hope that you guys put in all your all and you won your last series before
2:14:44
the holiday break anything you'd like to say to your fans I'd like to say thank you to all
2:14:49
the supportive fans and it's the holiday so I hope you guys have a good holidays and even after the holidays we
2:14:57
have a lot of matches coming up so we put in even more effort to keep this
2:15:02
up and that's the end of the interview with owner and back to the space thank
2:15:13
you welcome back to the space cookies and creams y'all it was an easy game
2:15:18
there for T1 they were able to get it done as they were a two Victor over you're saying you're anti vanilla cuz
2:15:25
that seemed to be a bit of a debate on the Caster desk no no no uh cookies and cream has vanilla in it so a little bit
2:15:32
of chuo you're saying vanilla isn't good enough it needs cookies in it I'm saying I like both so you're also saying you
2:15:38
hate chocolate I'm just I'm just trying to get the record straight here why don't we dive into the player of the
2:15:43
match votes as uh again owner getting his second one of the lck cup little bit
2:15:49
of a split vote here oh what did going for K media I almost went for going top
2:15:55
I'm actually surprised that I'm I'm I voted K alone but anyways I think he
2:16:00
performed really well and uh I really want to high value carer especially in
2:16:05
this matter because like he he attack and he protect it's just
2:16:12
crazy yeah I mean what I mean is that did you just roll your R yeah of course
2:16:17
see those double C's come on yeah of course but anyways I think in Fes it's
2:16:22
really important to have like huge champion pool uh in support role uh so I
2:16:27
feel like K is having a really huge Advantage towards the team and I think
2:16:33
that makes T1 really stronger and similarly I had this I actually almost literally use the same quote for owner
2:16:39
actually um but uh I said he he runs summer Rift it's his playground he has a super multifaceted play style as well
2:16:45
can play those 80 tanky Champions like the Sha and absolutely Crush team fights but can also warp team fights on the map
2:16:51
with picks like the Lilia like the N we've seen him uh succeed so much on excelon poppy for example he's so known
2:16:57
for Sani so owner just was to me the most consistent player here for T1 and gave them so many edges in the early
2:17:04
game let's see what chronicler wrote here he was on the cast and had himself uh a vote for owner as well Spin to Win
2:17:11
pretty straightforward he did he had the shinel Crescent guard yeah and he had the Lilia Q so I mean he was spinning
2:17:17
and he was winning that does make sense yeah we've had quite the um the pullit
2:17:23
surprise writers on the Korean side let's see what they have Helios didn't make it for the game one desk so that's
2:17:29
a reference to that yeah that's true is he here right now I hope so I hope he made by the in game to was some quick
2:17:35
games by T1 but yeah I guess I guess we'll see all right who else oh
2:17:43
y he's there on the IAD uh well uh I'm sure he'll be here
2:17:50
soon soon oh he's back soon he's back soon all right uh Helios there he is I'm feeling a little drowsy M again shout
2:17:58
out to the Lilian that's all that we have there from the Korean side all right let's
2:18:04
take a look at the Highlight from this first game because it comes super early on literally the earliest highlight
2:18:09
we've had in the lck cup I mean this is level one right it's standard you want to scout out lane swaps is what you do on blue side when you think you have the
2:18:15
stronger level one they really overc commit here though T1 scouted early then back off and trap Nim here and the game
2:18:22
is basically decided In this passage of play because both mid and bottom laners
2:18:27
are basically unable to play the game afterwards and Noam actually greedy tried to channel backs here and it just
2:18:33
ends up being a disaster yeah I mean uh we could show some kind of boring
2:18:38
highlights like team fight highlight but I really think that this kind of segment
2:18:44
is kind of over you know like after what it happened at level one You definitely
2:18:50
cannot play the game it's a greedy back attempt there like you could also get punished there but they don't but this Ward is super high value they see Le
2:18:56
hens is still here and T1 are just like oh you completed some of your your back some people are out I only see three
2:19:01
Champions here we have all of our team here and then your level one aalii is
2:19:06
going to have kind of a bad time here lens's obviously still level one as well just gets taken out first has to flash
2:19:12
over the wall so he's down at low health so can't help his teamates out on the follow-up play and then Lulu at level
2:19:17
one is one of the most oppressive range supports you can ever face and now you're trapped here fer is like oh God
2:19:23
I'm super low health I can't help you and then they commit the Summoners to actually get Flash and look for a kill
2:19:28
here and even if nobody dies I mean minions are clashing in mid and in top
2:19:34
at this point I mean the the laning phase essentially ended by this passage of play they had to reset and Faker is
2:19:40
just having fun on mid lane he's just freezing the lane and just uh actually denying the minion wave so I think it
2:19:46
was really crucial and I think after that the game plan is not really meaningful for the an side yeah and that
2:19:53
doesn't even include the car a solo kill on the bottom side of the map on to King in which snowballed every single Lane
2:19:59
there basically a tough toughs um run here for Nong shim and not a lot you could take away maybe in that first game
2:20:07
good strategy good hands not great strategy enough to review that second game it
2:20:12
just booms so early on the opposite side here for T1 though just a lot of takeaways here from the bottom side of
2:20:19
the map a 20 week for the squad 20 week for smash they find themselves on the top of the
2:20:24
leaderboard uh I mean the the points difference is still huge like five points and I think it's really rough for
2:20:31
the group Baron to chase down the group Elder but I think now they're just
2:20:37
getting better and better so it feels like it's going to be Mass here yeah mind you um their wins are against DRX
2:20:44
KT rolster and Nim they only lost to D+ who's currently undefeated so the the
2:20:50
real test is still yet to come but I do feel like T1 have been very consistent and you know D+ have been a really
2:20:56
strong team so no shame in losing there but they've been more consistent than Han life Esports for example which I think is a huge Boon coming to this cuz
2:21:03
you weren't even the top seed for group Baron Han life actually were they came in taking away your top laner but at the
2:21:08
end of the day you're sitting in first place yeah I think one of the big talking points for this week's match up
2:21:15
between these two squads was the bottom side of the map substitute comes on in how do you feel that smash did in his
2:21:21
debut here with it I mean uh we have to talk about the roster change first because definitely uh zus and Guma Yushi
2:21:29
like both players are like mixing up really well for example you can play on top side because you have really strong
2:21:34
top side and also you have really great uh playmaker on the Bol Lane so I think
2:21:39
that roster already proved themselves with the with the two times W winning right and you cannot say which is better
2:21:46
cuz like it's obviously they got the result but uh they're must be a reason
2:21:51
why T is uh always on the top they're trying always trying the new stuffs over
2:21:56
and over again and at the end of the year they're always on the top right so I think it definitely uh does have the
2:22:03
reason why uh ton is trying a new stuffs even though they won WS two times in a
2:22:09
row my my final thoughts really on smash's debut week is he was set up really well in these games and he played
2:22:14
incredibly well but they were ahead in those wins right you know we had the way error where he flashed in right got
2:22:20
ahead in that game he played Caitlyn in game one here and in game two of this series as well they had a massive Advantage from level one I really want
2:22:26
to see what he looks like when T1 is behind when they're really struggling a little bit more and I think that's when we're really going to know what this
2:22:33
player is is fully capable of I think we should give huge credit to uh smash especially because like he not only he
2:22:40
playing really good right now but also the situation he got right now I think he's proving himself really well all
2:22:46
right well T1 bounced back with the two week you know who else is looking for a two week that's right it's bro time baby
2:22:54
they're taking on K2 or trying to bounce back from the loss against 21 earlier and here's a quote from world champion
2:23:01
Barrel bro is a strong enough team to be ranked alongside T1 and Hana life Esports from barl doesn't miss barl
2:23:09
doesn't miss he doesn't miss often and we'll get to see if he's right or not as the Bros take on KT after this short

3:01:38
KT welcome back ladies and gentlemen it is time for the final match of this week's lck cup action and we have saved
3:01:46
one of the best till last yes KT fans this is great for you because the
3:01:52
majority of the players that are going to be heading onto the rift are kts and
3:01:57
it's great for bro fans because I mean you're a bro fan so you're just psyched about it but also they just beat geneng
3:02:03
G why are you looking quizzical there AR mostly KT players taking to the rift today yeah but given the performance of
3:02:10
of hype and dock down respectively I think you have a little bit of loner remorse if you're KT I'm not going to
3:02:18
it is still the truth as bro move up to third place in group Baron when we were talking about them as being almost
3:02:25
definitely eliminated and uh KT towards the bottom of group Elder but group Elder are looking a whole lot better
3:02:31
than group Baron at the moment group Baron stay alive they could still theoretically with a win everywhere from
3:02:38
now on make it to parody but it is that's a difficult toss there are still
3:02:44
some games to play yeah things are not looking so hot for a group Baron but when push comes to shove let's be
3:02:52
honest teams are playing for themselves so as long as you are not in the dreaded bnk spot or in the spot where Nim is
3:02:59
right now although again group Elder I don't think they're going to be worried you're probably going to be fine but it's not over until it's really over and
3:03:06
no team encapsulates that better than bro this is a rough line bro successfully pulls an upset versus KT
3:03:14
the claim K Improvement is in progress yikes that's um that's a rough
3:03:22
one that that's I mean the Telecom war was not a great time to be a KT fan I think especially on the bottom side of
3:03:28
the map we saw some big struggles um smash's debut looked smashing uh
3:03:34
absolutely hey it was a free gamer it was that was something it was um it was
3:03:40
not it was not a lot that it did feel like um yeah KT were not necessarily
3:03:45
playing up to what we expect their potential to really look like and then closer versus bdd this is kind of fun
3:03:53
there's some uh some trades that have that have happened here but uh BD has won all of them um basically
3:03:59
25-9 is not a good score line there for closer and we'll see whether he can uh try and close that Gap a little no pun
3:04:05
intended or was the pun intended I don't know it worked and there is so much
3:04:10
questions going into a match like this cuz Brion just come offs two Z which I'm
3:04:17
still like them I know they often two Z the teams that are the best teams in the
3:04:22
lck but ji isn't even the best team in the LK at the moment which is what really gets me and yet bro still two
3:04:29
zeroed them and I wanted everyone to think back to week number one when the Hy was at a Max Level from all of us for
3:04:37
bro we were like guys this team is actually good and then in week one they bombed and it didn't look good and now
3:04:44
they just two gen and I just don't know what to think if I think too much I'm going to start thinking about KT as well
3:04:50
and I don't know what all of it means um yeah I don't know
3:04:56
either oh man I'm I'm really looking forward to this mainly because it's
3:05:02
finally happened uh and also I want to bring this up again I think we showed it earlier on uh but Barrel had a thing or
3:05:08
two to say about uh KT H sorry about bro as well and I really want to like really
3:05:15
Hammer home just how impressive the victory against gen was and it may have
3:05:22
spilled over to scrims we don't necessarily know DK also got look at this well yeah
3:05:31
okay but DK did get beaten by them in the C cup finals right like he they did
3:05:36
get DK were currently our best team got clapped they did by the Bros and they're
3:05:41
strong enough to be ranked alongside T1 and hle so Barrel is going to be taking them seriously from now on and I think
3:05:48
that everyone should stand up and pay some attention much like chronicler should take barrels seriously because he
3:05:54
is not a meme he is in fact a two-time world champion and uh KT two statements can be can be T side by side they cannot
3:06:02
Atlas you you have been the number one turning you have been the one who in
3:06:08
2023 Direction was like guys just wait next year it's an even years what do you call that that's not a meeme that's the
3:06:15
fact no it wasn't a PT 2024 wasn't very good yeah but it still could have been
3:06:23
that I believe in all these things I I this is the difference oh you you
3:06:30
truly believe yeah this is this is Faith well I wouldn't I I would say that I don't believe you but I do know you are
3:06:36
currently jacked up on channel points because you believed in Pro so I got way
3:06:41
more Channel points than I've ever had in my entire life to stand on whatsoever here so I'm just going to I'm going to
3:06:48
and I'm going to focus on the game here for me the main thing I want to look towards today is W because W was
3:06:53
together with hype one of the biggest reasons to be excited yes unbox incredible yes the coming of Zin turned
3:07:01
KT from a good roster into an absolutely insane one I still want to see that guy
3:07:06
debut by the way although with BD's performance recently I don't know how likely that is but wey thus far has not
3:07:12
looked good from do I'm not near I'm not quite as surprised given that I think do
3:07:17
has unfortunately not been able to you know live I think he missed he missed it
3:07:23
you know I feel like the time came a few know exactly what you were talking about yeah where you really had the
3:07:29
opportunity to turn yourself into one of the greats I think right now Doom at least needs to be serviceable which I'd
3:07:34
argue he hasn't found that level yet but wey was a player that I was so excited about to see and it was alongside that
3:07:40
man right there hype and we saw them decimate even internationally Challengers and equivalent bot Lanes
3:07:47
across the world and then thus far in the LC just hasn't been very good and I want to see him be good because I know
3:07:54
that he can be it feels like maybe a little bit of over compensating but if KT lose this game it means that the race
3:08:01
is still on that list and we haveen on our best of 25 yet for Ider it's about
3:08:06
Baron versus Elder and right now the Bros are the baron but they are on the red side as we can see here in this
3:08:13
Champion Select that is already well and truly started the Ash and the vi taken
3:08:18
away is the obligatory kalista and the scarner bands coming in on the side of
3:08:24
bro Rumble to be taken away here is kind of interesting perfect has an actually pretty decent Rumble not wanting to
3:08:30
first pick that one something else on their mind perhaps with the ash it's
3:08:36
vars I can't believe that they didn't give wow they wao okay I actually really
3:08:42
thought that they were gunning for the vars with the fact that the ash was uh was banned away here often that's the accepted trade but they'll take a Jace
3:08:49
instead bdd has played this in mid as well so it is a legitimate Flex for KT I
3:08:54
do think that the varus pryo even though I I i' still I would be okay with it get locked in I do think it's dropped a
3:09:00
little bit as we've gotten deeper into Fearless I think here during the second week and again I think this is a
3:09:05
perfectly fun pick but I think in the second or in the first series we also saw it like even up until the second
3:09:10
game it got pretty far in and it was just kind of passed over there were a few teams that had made uh you know just
3:09:18
first picking Baris work quite well uh which is why it still seems a little bit interesting as the ambessa going to be
3:09:24
taken away here by Morgan he's uh tried his handed that one of course it's closer in the mid lane so we could see
3:09:30
him do a little bit of what Faker did of course played behind Faker for quite some time and so might be taking a leaf
3:09:35
out of his book Dr Ezreal might be the case here and we're setting up for a bit of Pope imagine if it was just Jace
3:09:42
Ezreal zoeey and we see that draft again after how many years if we get bdd zoee
3:09:49
I will lose it I know I know we've seen it already like showmaker has already busted brought it back oh it would fit
3:09:56
in this drop oh my God CU does have his n card as we all know he does so it
3:10:01
would be completely okay to lock that in I wouldn't mind this for a way cuz maybe it'll make him play a little bit more
3:10:08
for bdd Zia okay I'm not going to be nearly as excited about that I I know
3:10:14
it's good but we've seen this a lot of times we haven't seen him play it so far this year I know Atlas but that's that's
3:10:20
a fun thing I'm daring to dream bigger I want b i I ever I still have dreams of
3:10:26
his 2021 world's performances almost dragging his team to
3:10:31
a World Finals only single game away Los eventually that that was amazing it was
3:10:38
as the Aurora gets locked in okay man bro I I think they're very happy I don't
3:10:44
know how we somehow end up with them having Aurora and Bessa and Varys that is a lot of good Champions it's a lot of
3:10:50
good Champions now how they work together I think is going to be a little bit more dependent on the execution but
3:10:56
ambessa to me feels like similar to reekon in that she her backline dive is better but you can play her into
3:11:01
basically anything have a lot of playmaking potential as well I I hate that N I hate azir n so
3:11:10
honestly I feel like that ban is kind of a throw away Ed giving score a bit of a freebie you know yeah like poppy uh vgo
3:11:19
which is a Col special even though I don't really like the vgo I think will make a lot more sense if they if they actually lock full setup lless nly I
3:11:27
think you're very happy like look at what they have so far no absolutely as the could be annoying but you have so
3:11:33
much hard engage we're in game one yeah uh poppy probably should be the Bann right but instead it's going to be Leona
3:11:40
so bro might be just thinking we can play Poppy and then they could uh bring that themselves theoretically a flex
3:11:47
between Po and hok you could say don't see very much jungle poppy anymore
3:11:53
though as all right one final ban here for KT what is it going to be what is it going to be still focusing on PO perhaps
3:12:00
they might be fearing a bit of the uh the poppy situation although Ezreal fares very well in poppy so maybe
3:12:07
they're kind of okay with it the Wukong will be taken away instead huk just play lease in man I just want to see you play
3:12:13
leas in every single game if it's available this instead is uh oh please
3:12:18
oh don't temp me FR okay that's ZZ hovered once again I'm I'm not I'm not
3:12:23
even going to look I'm not even going to look I'm sorry adlas but this is a stronger champion and it fits the comp
3:12:29
pretty well too and it's harder to oh he did it he did it I'm I'm getting excited
3:12:35
before it's even happened he his his game on lein rivaled Canyon's game on Le
3:12:41
it's fine because you're getting excited for bro which is the right course of action I know but hype is a member of KT
3:12:48
technically don't we can't we can't start thisas there's too many I mean
3:12:53
what do you mean like huk is also an xkt player that's true there's a lot of me
3:12:59
as far as xkt there's a lot yeah this is a complete no-brainer yeah uh we are going to see where it goes because
3:13:05
obviously we have to get another lock in here but I we've seen this air poy com a million times I do think that we're most
3:13:12
likely going to see Co pick it up instead because I think as you're saying the jungle poppy just hasn't felt quite as strong so we're just Hing some cool
3:13:20
stuff that actually is really good in it's just going to be zenzo though as as we all know yeah I don't think KT is
3:13:26
going to be taking any Grand risks and the thing with zenzo is that he just he
3:13:32
just works in any come you know he's just I feel like always fine you're never going to be excited about vanilla
3:13:38
ice cream as I feel like that was a previous I know and it really triggered a lot of people there are a lot of very
3:13:45
aggressive vanilla defense yeah well I I didn't realize there was also a ton of people then talking about
3:13:52
their favorite flavers which actually is my favorite thing to see and everyone was just respecting each other's opinion it's like I respect that I think you're
3:13:59
wrong but I like my ice cream like this which you know that's that's wonderful that's a that's a beautiful I don't want
3:14:05
to do an ice cream conversation again atas the you know I never I think he likes cookies and cream although he
3:14:10
might be referring to the ice cream that Deon got that made me extraordinarily upset um so it might be that that is his
3:14:17
favorite oh that's that's really nice good for you yo mint choco which is B really really
3:14:25
popular ear in G it's my wife's favorite as well I like Min chocol Min chocolate like I used to think like why do they
3:14:31
even have this I saw it at the ice cream there was no in between I was really
3:14:37
confused but here like goes off everyone loves it I love a dark chocolate yeah and dark and nutty yeah yeah yeah maybe
3:14:43
some hazelnuts a good chocolate ice cream like really good is probably Peak like I don't even know
3:14:50
it's hard man is coffee actually the best is it my favorite I don't know what are these DFT do we haven't discussed it
3:14:56
we may get into that keep getting sidetracked yeah we may get into that as we hop onto the rift KT versus bro
3:15:03
though huk back on his lease in we'll see whether he can do it again but this time it's into a poppy it's a bit
3:15:08
dangerous could be a big test for the young player as let's get ready to dive onto the rift for game number one KT
3:15:15
versus bro
3:15:20
[Music]
3:15:36
uh unfortunately Atlas has left I am pretty sure he has moved over to the
3:15:41
space um I I don't want to I I don't want to alarm Deon but it might be a good time to start running because you
3:15:49
might have thought that Atlas was joking about the ice cream thing but I think he takes it very seriously hopefully uh we
3:15:55
get a game to talk about I hope we can shove that conversation because really
3:16:00
in the first series I don't know if you watched but there wasn't a whole lot going on I want actual gameplay I want us to go to free games and I'm just
3:16:06
going to be so lusting for the foreseeable future until Atlas comes back from his quest yeah no I'm back I
3:16:12
actually never left I was just sitting here I just uh needed some time uh to cool off
3:16:17
as we going to be clearing out some Vision here as they do manage to at least create a path but I think
3:16:23
information has gone over now and it is going to be standard Lanes achieved by
3:16:29
bro is what it feels like I could imagine being a Varys Nautilus might feel all right into the poppy Ezreal in
3:16:36
the early stages of the lane things can go either way realistically particularly with The
3:16:42
lethality vars one of the things that's really interesting to me is that ever since the new changes actually think that
3:16:48
the setup of lethality varis is way stronger in mid and late game than it
3:16:54
used to be but it's not that much of a lan bully anymore and obviously also go Comet Halo blades used to be a lot
3:16:59
stronger both as a rune and I think with the uh the early atomization but while
3:17:05
it's still strong I don't think it's nearly as aggressive as it used to be yep you do have a lot of control of the
3:17:11
lane oh he will yeah and I still think it's it's solid but I think that there were times where you could not Lane
3:17:18
until a and then we didn't was that because it was being played with Ash uh
3:17:23
well that was obviously yeah but I think even outside of that like the verse has been meta for I don't know just feels
3:17:29
like an infinite amount of time as a lot of these players love the UK on that is very funny a lot of these players are
3:17:36
generally going to be likely to win but hype or humbach R are getting that win against gen do not be fooled that was
3:17:43
against what many were expecting including me to be the best team in the LC definitely an achievement worthy of
3:17:50
noting I also want to go and highlight a rune Choice here that I don't think I've seen before which is BD for PTA on the
3:17:58
Zero wow yeah I think meing done on the LEC about like which uh runes have been
3:18:06
was it on LC or L LPL maybe I don't I have seen Comet I've seen grasp I've
3:18:11
seen lethal Tempo I've seen conqueror I don't know if I've ever seen PTA I haven't seen PTA if I have then it was a
3:18:18
very long time ago and I'm sorry my memory doesn't quite get there fck he finds the que there's the first blood
3:18:24
and he even predicted a flash that didn't come in or an Arcane shift or something because he flashed for it and
3:18:31
now wey is dead there is no way out oh pun not intended let's see how they
3:18:36
manag to orchestrate this as yeah he just watches he is going to be able to get a slam but not onto the Target that
3:18:43
is tanking the turret and out there go po realized uh the error of his way so he will die as well but one for two
3:18:50
First Blood going over to bro I guess you take that yeah you do that's hok
3:18:56
with a perfectly timed gang there po was the one that set it up and immediately
3:19:02
this is what we were expecting off of huk I don't think we really saw it in week number one because there is a
3:19:08
reason why this guy was the only one that could even hold a candle to Lucid back when he was still in Challengers
3:19:14
and when Lucid was gone this guy was string around and no one could match him and it's because of aggression like this
3:19:20
as we take another look level Advantage here and then when dogdom actually gets the buffer they're like oh maybe we can
3:19:26
trade back look at that flash together with that auto attack and then here we
3:19:33
actually plays it as well as reasonably could is able to not get allo which means he gets the flash stun into the
3:19:39
wall the problem and Apollo knows the moment he does that that he's going to die which I think is completely fine is
3:19:45
just to make sure that hype actually get the arrow guaranteed but there is hype
3:19:50
looking for even more here is perfect not really liking this Lane swap that has come down 400 Health left on the
3:19:57
Jace and bro are going to continue their assault this time towards the top side huk actually in tow and let's see how
3:20:04
Morgan is going to fair in a similar situation great heroic charge here from we to start this one up has a knockup
3:20:10
comes in and dock arm secures the kill but he's dead and that is actually Morgan picking up the kill I was worried
3:20:16
the Morgan hadn't actually tagged him but still going to be credited with that one so not the cleanest there from
3:20:23
KT there is a lot of AOE on the ambessa right so ends up actually getting the tag I thought the same I thought that
3:20:29
maybe he wouldn't have and that's new turrets right there noxy and turrets they do not mess around oh no got them
3:20:36
going down and I I was I was actually saying or thinking as well looking at that normally what you do in a zzo dive
3:20:43
is you just allow him to stack up on the turret and may they they probably were and as we see now Morgan is basically
3:20:48
level six so they were try and make sure is my interpretation that they didn't hit the timer also fact that Doom did
3:20:55
effectively get two shot by the turret might have still thrown them off but that's a big win for bro because towards
3:21:01
the top side of the map they were able to bully out perfect and it should equal some grubs as well and with an ambessa
3:21:07
composition this is going to feel absolutely fantastic they can endlessly clear waves in mid lane in theory
3:21:12
throughout the mid game so it will give Morgan a lot of space to try and play for these Sid Lane turrets and with a
3:21:19
few extra grubs certainly going to feel good so bro picking up the first one see whether they do manage to get the sandals of strength and it should be
3:21:27
yeah hbar picking that one out up without a contest so cuz starting off on this cloud dragon uh-oh and oh dear
3:21:36
Morgan's found him Po's also made his way in doesn't land the anchor but I don't think cuz is living this one he's
3:21:43
a little uh out of Flash and so that could just be a nice leash huk moving on
3:21:49
over as well bdd not a lot he can do about this situation wey is over there but look at that just cruising in from
3:21:55
the top of your screen it is the Blind Monk himself dressed as Sagat from Street Fighter love that skin and he
3:22:02
will be able to secure a second portion of their second feed of strength here
3:22:08
and they're only one away at 7 and 1/2 minutes but Tak another look so you have
3:22:13
the setup with poppy and he definitely would have hit Level six so I understand the need but crucially if it's cuz that
3:22:20
gets aggro there he's fine right I think Zino can definitely live through that but he doesn't and then here Morgan
3:22:26
because there's no flash on cuz he gets minimal time to respond if he flashes that probably is fine because perfect
3:22:33
was actually relatively close because the PRI that was there for bot and bro do give up a full wave in bot to get
3:22:39
this but if you get the kill plus the Dragon that's 100% worth it and also do
3:22:44
note ocean and the cloud already off the board so infernal Mountain he stack all still
3:22:54
available man if it's a hexte is absurd for both of these teams but with Bros
3:23:00
advantage that they have right now that would certainly be a dangerous Prospect right now though speaking of danger
3:23:06
perfect is having a pretty good time see where his build is going to go as of course we've seen different
3:23:12
adaptations since the unending unending despair has been disabled yeah and what you see as well now is that as a result
3:23:19
of Morgan dropping the wave there and and heading for that play he is pretty substantially behind so that's why uh
3:23:26
even with the kill he is basically even perect actually able to get a nice amount of Cs as the the price that bro
3:23:33
had to pay but again I don't think they're going to be too bothered about that maintaining pressure here as well with dying twice already really
3:23:41
falling pretty substantially behind hype here as well the biggest lead though is
3:23:46
in the jungle and we'll just have to see whether this continues like I haven't seen since Canyon sort of like Peak
3:23:54
canion we haven't seen that much solo Q lease in you know like I'm a I'm a Smurf
3:24:00
and I'm just making your games a living hell and having a great was lucid who then also had some
3:24:08
equally uh solo quesque moments and huk the cool thing was that he did the solo que thing but then against Canyon as
3:24:16
well that not only that but also then didn't do the the other solo que thing where you just walk into the enemy
3:24:21
jungle because you're fed and die or have like an incredible early game and then do actually nothing um that could
3:24:28
be the other thing and there is a chance that hok does that this game just have to see how he carries this Advantage
3:24:33
further no I'm not buying it I don't think that that's a humbug move that's not a humbug move that is not a hug we
3:24:39
do have to put it out there though overextend and die going way too H that I can see oh yeah that I will believe
3:24:45
but I do not so doing too much is more likely than not doing 100% which is so funny because that's exactly
3:24:53
the thing that we have wanted from bro for so long and bro activity so they
3:24:59
have been able to do it bro activity is a thing because it happened in the early game all the time their transitions from
3:25:06
early to mid game have been so much better and their late game decision- making is also improved I feel and
3:25:12
that's what's really helping bro actually strings of W's together especially against gen in both the
3:25:17
kesper Cup Final and in their previous best of three where going to keep Haring on
3:25:23
about that I know that gen fans do find it a little bit hard to hear but for bro fans it is so huge they were able to do
3:25:30
that believe that bro have been both of the best team oh Hy is dead caught on the flash and will be taken down cuz
3:25:36
even able to get in there with some assist gold as we were talking about it Bros unfortunately lose their most fed
3:25:43
member or at least the member that does need the most money yeah going to be down for 13 seconds
3:25:49
that is going to be a denial on this one as well as flash out from perfect Morgan gets that and down comes closer they are
3:25:57
not finished yet haven't seen much from closer so far as he puts perfect Inner Circle and let's see whether they can
3:26:03
complete the dive the answer is there is no dive unless po decides that this is going to happen there's the hook trying
3:26:09
to hold perfect in place as best he can and does get the ulti for the knockup so they commit everything they do manage to
3:26:15
get their pridee let's see whether they can make itth it as the grubs were traded for on that top
3:26:21
side or at least one of them was start with KT killing some hype both literally and metaphorically as hyp does Flash
3:26:27
still ends up going down but I'm pretty surprised that the play ended up working out I thought when perfect flash that it
3:26:34
was a bit of a hard Force also Clos using his but it's actually po that ends up being the big Difference Maker
3:26:39
extends the play they do still get the shove in and they're able to pick up a kill and now closer is getting fed and
3:26:46
we already talked about huk performance I think closer against gen also was playing incredible as we take a look
3:26:52
here we just never get sick of watching bdd play as here and hype
3:26:57
there you can even flash to the side yeah I mean and it would have would have been okay but just misjudged the range
3:27:05
there and then here again I I saw this I'm like he's probably fine right especially with the speed up and then
3:27:11
here the funny thing is it's not actually the damage to perfect but it's the damage to the Minions that being the
3:27:16
biggest Difference Maker as po shows up as is available so perect is never
3:27:22
living there as we have a trade in a big trim picture for first turret blood but let's be real it looks very good for
3:27:29
Brion and they will be able to get it and that is the sandals Atlas they put them together and there was only a third
3:27:34
of a sandal like KT a basically Barefoot and that's a hex tech Soul both teams
3:27:41
starting it off with one Dragon a piece so three hex tech hexx that's five thaty
3:27:49
yeah this turret is in trouble as wey is going to get rid of someone Morgan looking going to try and make an escape
3:27:54
here or was he trying to engage on KZ as hok making his way back in Crescent guard going to keep KZ alive but that is
3:28:01
a big cool down for any skirmishes that are going to be coming up the next one thankfully is quite a ways away so
3:28:07
doesn't need to worry about it too much as back not going to be interrupted there as I don't believe we had his
3:28:12
buckler available nor was it quite in range I guess he does throw at that minion I am happy to report that the way
3:28:20
level of play seems to have markedly risen both the play that he had towards the bottom side of the map with the dive
3:28:26
I played that and then would you say that it's way better I would say that it's way better would there be any other
3:28:31
way to say how far away from his geni
3:28:36
performance do you think this from his previous performance do you think this is what the the what meas what measure
3:28:43
are you looking for I which whatever one you feel
3:28:49
like okay so go back to ice cream uh no I I I think the Dust for look good but
3:28:55
let's see how he actually plays out the fights but yeah way to me in those games it did feel like the classic I need to
3:29:03
make a play and I'm new in the lck and I really got to step it up and then ends up kind of backfiring immensely is cuz
3:29:09
going in on Pao here yeah perfect in the area Dr not going to quite find the ulti though and now the rest of the Bros turn
3:29:15
up they are never alone and there is the punishment onto CZ remember he had to
3:29:21
use that ultimate earlier and only 7 Seconds now till that one's back up and
3:29:26
available Atlas I'm going to tell you right now that would I don't think that would have saved it like with that I
3:29:34
mean there were a lot of bad guys yeah well that and also they are all melee in in like right on top of him there was a
3:29:40
little bit of uh I mean he would have been able to knock a few away though yeah but not huk I don't actually yeah I
3:29:47
don't know I think I was definitely had Pao Tagged so I mean he definitely didn't have it so it's irrelevant either
3:29:54
way I I like hypotheticals you know to take a let's have a look at it this is still just well played by Pao right like
3:30:00
yes he gets tacked but he hooks away then side steps that ultimate and then here unach with great
3:30:08
timing no right like Hy even if he had the AL Paulo had buffered the like at
3:30:14
the time he would have used used it he had the dredge line buff it anyway yeah um I don't know how much Nautilus would
3:30:21
have done but still yeah you mean that he could have like knocked po back well he would have knocked po back but he
3:30:26
still would have gone to the wall yeah with how dredge line Works would not have would not have ended well in
3:30:31
fortunately for him this is one of the things that particularly when you're playing melee Bruiser into melee Bruiser
3:30:39
like once you start falling behind it gets very unfun something like zenzo is so riing on being able to stat check
3:30:45
people pretty consistently it'll still be a big threat for the back line huh
3:30:51
and finds it as po that's again like he is actually in danger there's no one
3:30:56
near but they don't know that and he's always had friends
3:31:02
uh so far so okay going to let him stay alive here going fight here yeah huk
3:31:09
already over the wall starting off Shelly here closer moving down circle at the ready look at Morgan he's on
3:31:17
see whether Morgan can find that angle you can see perfect does have teleport he can make his way in hype tagged by the Alti there as keeper verdict doesn't
3:31:25
find the target but there's a public execution and way goes down in front of all of his friends closes over the wall
3:31:31
as well po will be taken out so it's a one for one cuz is able to nail the Smite and bro unfortunately will lose
3:31:40
out in the team fight even though they get we it's a lot of resources thrown
3:31:45
into Target that doesn't matter that much the elf bars get a little bit too low for Comfort I think closer felt
3:31:52
obligated and the big thing there was KT just not shying away from the fight and moving into the pit earlier which
3:31:59
necessitated closer to us old I think kind of like semi semi offensively semi defensively but there was no followup
3:32:05
cuz the rest of his team outside of huk couldn't follow as we're going to take another look at it here so look at what
3:32:11
I mean with cuz and bde there hok and closer don't really want
3:32:17
to walk up because the teleport teleport from perfect actually ends up being a really big deterrent and then yes they kill way but Clos has already taken out
3:32:25
of the fight took way too much damage which means the hanar can't really look for a steel right next to it but very
3:32:31
awkward positioning mainly from hype like he wants to be standing behind his team but he was sort of standing behind a wall and off to the side and itn't
3:32:38
quite working out as bro will'll be able to get priority on this hex tech Dragon the first one of the game we'll be
3:32:45
getting towards Wards their second Drake here as well that is a lot of power as B
3:32:50
is looking for Morgan cuz is making his way up as there's the flash traded there for Morgans as he gets his way out but
3:32:57
is he actually safe as's a way he's going to move on over huk also trying to find perfect here who does just Hammer
3:33:03
him back yep that's an extraordinarily dead ambassa unless she has a few no
3:33:09
that is just a kill going over to cuz very nicely done here by KT but bro traded for the outer in the mid lane
3:33:15
just need to try and make sure they don't lose too many extra structures towards the top side because that is a
3:33:20
pick into a turret well they have the herald as well it doesn't look like they're going to use it bdd is
3:33:27
continuing his streak of being the best thing about KT trying is uh is very
3:33:33
darnest and it's him forcing The Flash that ends up to Morgan going down later on now this his Rift maker done as well
3:33:39
as we take another look yeah Morgan opted into that bone blading fell off thought he could make it happen but
3:33:44
crucially the rotation and this is just Morgan making a big misplay when your team is towards the mid part of the map
3:33:50
and is flying a lot of pressure there trying to look for the one through one for your dead far up the side just at
3:33:55
worst you only lose your or at best you only have to blow your flash at worst exactly this situation happens and it
3:34:01
could have been worse if he goes down earlier and they throw down the Herold because they were winning just getting
3:34:07
that mid lane turn is a really big Boon for Brion doesn't feel like that was an
3:34:12
sess maybe if Morgan doesn't show up there they don't get the mid lane turret but I think the siege from bro is pretty
3:34:18
spooky yeah 30 seconds until the voracious arakan comes up for a
3:34:24
change never before seen in League of Legends Atlas not often seen on the bottom side of the map we do often see a
3:34:31
little bit more action on top side as bro really want to kill wayy oh man just
3:34:36
an extra link in that chain probably would have landed it but not going to quite find it there as closer finishes
3:34:43
off his second item Cosmic drive now done that is very large Aurora although BD is larger
3:34:50
you mentioned before he's already hit his two item Spike actually probably pretty ready to go for a back as yep
3:34:56
adakan yells a whole bunch and huk trying to trade some skill shots here with cuz so the biggest issue for huk is
3:35:05
who's the most fat member on Brion when it comes to uh to kills not necess sure
3:35:12
in terms of gold as we can see Morgan and close are both doing really really well is who do you actually kick and I I
3:35:20
think there's not really a great answer I think you actually have to set up just for the CC because realistically neither
3:35:25
dock nor bdd should ever be in a position where like you get to kick them into the team and they die because of
3:35:30
the amount of ability that they have the amount of deterr so for hanok most likely you're just going to look to
3:35:36
maybe kick perfect you know into the back line and then the rest of your team can follow up there is so much damage
3:35:41
available here for bro but I do think that they are a good amount squishier than their counterparts I think poppy is
3:35:48
just naturally so much tank here and then there is the it's kind of kind of not fully tank ja but mostly tank ja you
3:35:55
know with the shin plus the base resistances that you get in your melee form plus the fimble winter that will be
3:36:00
done momentarily they're quite beefy as we did spot C towards the top side of the map and I like this from Brion
3:36:07
that's some bro activity atas it absolutely is Morgan going to be teleporting in we're committing to this
3:36:12
play it's gone it is just gone yeah cuz is not getting over here jce keeper verdict can get rid of hok the answer is
3:36:18
no and he's all the way back in again down to 2,000 might get in but it's hok that takes it away and then takes a
3:36:25
quick trip back towards his Fountain wey also going to die but unfortunately that is for real and perfect going to have to
3:36:32
flash out of the way of the BR freight train that is bearing down upon them
3:36:37
hail of arrows comes through and now Morgan trying to take matters into his own hands but there's a wall of soldiers
3:36:42
from bdd buying some space he'll take the 100 gold there as well as do arm's not finished the oh piercing AR may have
3:36:49
overstepped here as hype is dangerous Sund comes up hok from the sight gets the kick with the knock up through
3:36:57
perfect and the rest of the Bros not quite here in time the first queue that I think hok's missed so far and hype not
3:37:02
going to find that one either the comet not enough to finish off PDD KT they slink away that could have been so much
3:37:11
worse if Brion were a little bit crisper on some of the execu there that could
3:37:16
have been the game Ender um yeah I mean that was all of them dead but none of them were okay no no no but what I'm
3:37:22
talking about is as this was a great macro call first and foremost credit then Paul's delay I think actually ends
3:37:29
up like I think cuz was just shy of SM range it's also Alo T I just want you to
3:37:35
pay attention to unfortunately some of the plays here from Brion so paulu uh flashes into the ball then hooks uh then
3:37:43
we have closer just kind of dying uh po then again hooking the wall andh walking
3:37:50
walking in and dying as PD just kills him and then huk this well done but
3:37:56
there isn't actually any followup and then huk missing uh the queue there could have also been the Difference Maker and then this Flash and then
3:38:04
despite all that yeah it's still fine it's still fine cuz they got Aon and they're going to get soulle point so uh
3:38:11
macro A+ for Brion really good call the moment they spot cuz pull the teleport
3:38:16
pull the trigger get that objective uh execution on fight afterwards you know
3:38:21
uh C what's what's passing great like C minus yeah something like that yeah worked worked out it's fine they got the
3:38:26
soul they got a decent amount of value from the other come B and they are in a wonderful spot here and the only one
3:38:33
standing St with his bdd is like I'm playing my pigeon oh I haven't died yet
3:38:39
please guys we can win this his lead really has evaporated though as closer
3:38:45
is 302 now and even though BD still has you know a whole bunch of farm and a
3:38:51
bunch of money it's not acing at the rate that he would like it to closer hops over the wall do D here just trying
3:38:58
to hold on to this mid lane oh no it's the Super Swift he's Atlas oh yeah with edge of Knight as well uh-huh it's going
3:39:06
to be tough to kill hype KT that that's where we are at that's where we're at we set up the death brush they spot it we
3:39:11
set it up again there's no way they'll fall for it twice I I think Morgan just needs to live in this bottom Lane try
3:39:19
and break up KT as much as possible have five grubs yeah oh no perfect that was
3:39:25
not good he free levels down that is absolutely absurd as now H going to get the mini stun into the wall the public
3:39:32
execution comes down and perfect kind of wishes that it wasn't so public as cuz
3:39:37
to be defended there as Morgan not going to be falling down he's level 15 yeah
3:39:43
which is weird because at the very beginning of game he he was kind of the the sacrifice right he was leaving Lane
3:39:49
all the time and uh since then I guess he's just been living in Lane all the
3:39:55
time closer also sitting at level 15 here is uh sorry Morgan I guess we c c
3:40:02
you as he's just going to dash around for a bit and then die I know promos aren't real anymore
3:40:08
but I know bdd isn't his man like he got a popup or something they changed the patch for him he is not giving up this
3:40:14
game Atlas oh him and his sand soldiers all of them
3:40:19
still trying their very hardest and KT aren't out of it yet like it's 3,000 gold it's meaning less and
3:40:26
less as this game goes on this was a nice pick from huk and always these leasin competions do feel not quite as
3:40:32
good as time goes on but so do zzo compositions a little
3:40:39
bit Yeah bdd spots Morgan no hesitation
3:40:45
also maybe could have looked to flash out but realistically bdd probably follows up here with him if he tries to
3:40:51
do that B has been very on point with those thus far but these type of sideline picks I think are actually as
3:40:56
you're saying a pretty big deal because now as soon as Morgan looks angrily at that botside turret is going to fall and
3:41:03
crucially while huk went for that play Baron wasn't up yet so there wasn't really an opportunity to punish for KT
3:41:09
and it was also a long way away from uh the next dragon as well which is up in 2 minutes now you mentioned the baron
3:41:14
though has just spawned about a minute and a half ago so it could be on the
3:41:19
cards see who's going to be able to head over there and lock that one down it looks like cuz at the moment kind of kind of just have to at some point pull
3:41:25
the trigger if you're KT I don't even as you point out I think that the gold lead is is becoming relatively less valuable
3:41:32
I'd also argue that they do out scale but I think that Bros composition is a lot easier because you just nless hold
3:41:39
someone and then you throw all your damage on top of them yeah that's true I think it it it
3:41:46
does still have ways to to make things work I also think that yeah the chain cc is kind of revolting so we have a look
3:41:52
at the money and yes Morgan has more than perfect everyone the did this yeah
3:41:59
that's not when did that happen like it it's it's sort of snuck up on me and normally I'm pretty good at keeping tabs
3:42:05
on our Lord you know it's you are yeah you're generally the guy that does that some might say too well I I wouldn't but
3:42:12
yeah I I mean I I could probably commentate an entire bro bro game only talking about Morgan um and what he's
3:42:18
doing there's absolutely no shot I know you're a big Morgan fan but you would talk about some of the other Bros at
3:42:24
some point no but it would be all in reference to Morgan ah okay yeah no yeah yeah everything everything is you uh is
3:42:32
Morgan well I've H you do it well actually I guess maybe I do do that all the time anyway heard you do it with
3:42:37
Barrel plenty of time so actually I do 100% believe that uh as uh right now we
3:42:43
have the next dragon setup if Bon gets this that that'll be it that'll be a hex
3:42:50
lethality varis as hyp oh does get his spell shield popped and little bit dangerous speeding but that was a that
3:42:57
could have been a rough moment there speaking of dangerous the fats of strength that bro get are actually
3:43:02
bigger than everyone else's as now BD looking for polo he does get himself his shield as the chains of corruption go
3:43:08
down but H position and unfortunately he needs huk to come in and save his life
3:43:15
five oh that's that's going to be a dragon the night though that's huge unless oh no Morgan he wants the team
3:43:22
fight they can't get they can't get ex's back there no way they can't walk up cancel that canel yeah b b is like like
3:43:29
you say he's 100% in promos 100% in promos that is going to be denial
3:43:34
there's a long way to go to denying this Soul as of course bro do have soul point for quite some time this was only the
3:43:41
second for KT but they just need to keep making plays like that things are going to look good they also get the turret so
3:43:47
it's going to close the gold Gap as well it's like every time B goes for a shuffle stuff happens just flash just
3:43:54
flash it it's fine and it's understandable cuz he feels relatively safe cuz he's a nous under turret but
3:44:00
they're just clearly unbuttered the fact that hype loses both sums and that's
3:44:05
including humach like needing to go for a hero play there further means they cannot fight and the gold lead is still
3:44:11
there for Brion and I think the map control that they have will remain Val but I am we are you know you're hearing
3:44:18
the rickety sounds of a roller coaster winding up you know when you go up it's like and and the thing is we don't know
3:44:26
whether whether the roller coaster is going to be okay as Clos it gets out of the way the emperor divide this time around doesn't quite get what B is
3:44:32
looking for for Al yeah huk also we haven't talked about the poppy nearly as
3:44:38
uh not that much as a champion it's hard trying to play any of the Champions that
3:44:43
are in hide because they all do a lot of Dashing yep as we are upgrading shoes all over
3:44:51
the place only a couple more upgrades necessary here on bro to make sure that they have bought all of the things in
3:44:57
the new shop that they have access to B based on their very uh shiny Feats of
3:45:03
Strength as the hook it was on display there of course with the control W but
3:45:08
good Arcane shift timing there from Doon level eight kind of stagnated as
3:45:15
well except for perfect who is unfortunately still kind of getting boomed in that regard 5K Atlas actually
3:45:24
looking at it that's that's Bas that's it that's B that's the gold the gold lead is Morgan
3:45:31
it's just Morgan KZ is actually caught up very nicely with the assist that he got plus the global uh ambient gold he's
3:45:40
dog D's been ahead for a while it's all down to the Lord now hits his four of item on the ambass but he does need to
3:45:46
pop off unless hok can get a a hero kick and he is that's that's a pull bit angle
3:45:51
atas and he he wisely abandoned because IFD or W finds him he will die well bro
3:45:59
are now looking to try and clear out Vision where they can doesn't manage to get that Ward so they know that's there
3:46:04
but KT retain Vision Advantage around this Baron and Morgan going to head back
3:46:10
towards the bottom Lane he's got a lot of items that do a lot of damage like that's more of M is finished so he's got
3:46:17
four damage items that also make him a little bit tankier but he does so much like he you dead well it's it's so it's
3:46:24
the combination of like you get the eclipse Shield then for backup you have Mo and even though Maul I think generally is a worse item than sterex b
3:46:31
is definitely your number one enemy so I think the extra Mr makes a big difference and then you have death Dan on top of that as well which gives you
3:46:38
so much more sustain and allows you to really survive for a lot longer in these
3:46:43
fights I think GTR keeps it up these Vision traps that the one issue is that the engage from bro is still pretty good
3:46:50
so it looks like KT doesn't want to run the risk of setting up an objective and baron is still threatening dragon is not
3:46:57
perfect is going to be fine it's the same level as the Enemy jungler by the way but bro they just want hex deack
3:47:03
because if they get hex de Soul it's going to be really hard for them to lose the game even with how well bdd has been playing even with how this gold lead now
3:47:10
doesn't mean that much more anymore in the grand scheme of things I do think that if you're thinking about the trade
3:47:16
hextech soul and baron I actually would definitely take the hextech soul with how much broken like oh yeah fine fights
3:47:24
as well if KT get Baron it's not like a guarantee of like a huge influx of gold
3:47:29
because sing can be dangerous into all of these Champions that can just press these buttons that lock you down hexa is
3:47:36
just it's just dis it's it's also you know there's always discussions about what is the most powerful but I feel
3:47:42
like playing into hex for soul is by far the worst yeah it feels the most oppressive CU every single every single
3:47:50
ability hit just it just makes you slow it makes you sluggish it hurts your whole team yep I
3:47:58
do think mountain is kind of gross as well just with how durable you are I think it depends on compos yeah not a
3:48:05
good noodle well br going to uh just continue to try and push KT out of this area they
3:48:12
know the KT haven't been anywhere near the Dragon fight from yeah TR barrage going to get
3:48:18
the shield from hype so now KT can start trying to move forward that edge of Knight is so important to deal with is
3:48:25
now hug on a flank angle they haven't dealt with the wave just yet this there are flanks upon flanks
3:48:33
flanks wave is crashing as well as in they go yeah Morgan's making his way around the ulti comes down from closer
3:48:38
huk misses the que though as CZ goes in closer is the one in trouble but he lands the combo and it does so much
3:48:44
damage cuz has to flash for it has now doed on top of hype docked on maybe the hero for KT as Morgan in the river by
3:48:53
himself now H and po picked up by b e who says not today my Bros welcome back
3:49:01
to reality and the roller coaster comes crashing down on the Bros
3:49:10
I mean it may not be over yet and the dragon is still alive but KT they will be able to break open
3:49:16
the base they destroy the mid inhibitor I don't it's 17 seconds and that's Paulo
3:49:21
I mean it's Morgan he has to he has to do something crazy here because this turret is going to go down so quick yeah
3:49:27
can he deal with the wave oh there's one cast a minion and he's alting in okay
3:49:33
Morgan I wouldn't be walking around like that but the AOE damage is disgusting okay okay I'm never doubting
3:49:39
you again my Lord's alive he's alive yep he's alive so is is this
3:49:45
I don't know about this one closer I don't know about this one closer he throws down the ulti and he
3:49:50
[Applause] explodes
3:49:55
um that was like a from Fountain to to death chamber any% it's time and that's
3:50:02
a world record that's Challengers baby and the dragon is still going to
3:50:08
get fought for a closer I I I think they have to let this go which means that we're going to get sole points on side
3:50:13
from BD who now has a really cool hat and a potion uh so we are evening out the soul
3:50:22
points we're not done I I really didn't think Lord Morgan could do it and I
3:50:27
apologize personally I should have trusted him he's still got an item slot he is 6k gold up he is he's flame
3:50:34
Horizon perfect it's uh yeah there's no TP but there are hex Gates I actually think
3:50:41
that bro can contest this going to h s there way needs to be
3:50:46
in position to block this Le Sin from getting into the pit I don't H shouldn't
3:50:52
be able to get in realistically they shouldn't allow him yeah we just needs to press that W button but I think
3:50:57
they're looking for a turn they do not want to go for it he gets over the wall but oh he tries to get over the wall but we says no keep his verdict does not
3:51:03
land though is now away holding him in position Morgan finds the backline and may just execute everyone hook going to
3:51:11
connect there as bity is held in place for the perfect sorry for the public execution cuz is he going to fall down
3:51:18
the answer is finally yes but the rest of the Bros are so incredibly low Morgan
3:51:24
has to do this he has to do it basically by himself H can you be the hero the an is no as BD promos will not be denied
3:51:34
today he's still deathless Atlas why wasn't he playing his ear
3:51:41
every game well we did and then we came know that he we gave him a lot of crap
3:51:46
for that that that that's going to be it right they got I mean I mean is it I guess it's not
3:51:54
it they got Baron they they went mid lane the waves weren't prepped let's
3:51:59
just have a look at it again there's so much stuff happening here so H gets the
3:52:05
nightx as he should should never be able to make it in but then here tries to go
3:52:10
in on W W just slams into the wall and that's hug immediately taken out then closer tries to help out Morgan uh not
3:52:17
knowing that Morgan is the only one that can actually stand up to the might of KT
3:52:24
closer gets tacked there at the end and then crucially again bdd just takes as much damage as humanly possible and look
3:52:30
at this oh conquering sand straight through it humach trying to go to ham cuz I think the call to go and try and
3:52:37
look for a fight there is one thing but that definitely was the Lee trying to do
3:52:42
a little bit too much because specifically on way like we slammed into the wall B AO what like twice and then
3:52:48
he was out of the fight so it was a four versus five from that point on and not even the Lord can turn that but
3:52:54
somehow that alone is still not enough but I think that we've now turned the corner but duck is almost withal items
3:53:01
BD is a level 18 is here I don't think he loses these Atlas we need a hero play from bro if they want to get the win
3:53:07
here even perfect has like half a billion HP now as well he is a beefy boy
3:53:13
he really is doesn't quite have max level yet doesn't have very much Farmers oh hug looks for it but he doesn't get
3:53:19
the kick and KT they managed to weather that storm we'll see where the Bro can hold
3:53:26
on over here as hype throws down the chains of corruption just not quite doing enough closer and Morgan still up
3:53:32
there's still a lot of damage here with hype as well at are bleeding can Morgan find an angle so far they're doing a lot
3:53:40
but they're still going to lose this inhibitor as in goes bdd and Co collects the Baris now Morgan's in the back line
3:53:48
but I just don't think it's going to be enough as the Bros desperately try to hold on but KT will not be stopped not
3:53:56
when BD is wielding the Emperor of sherea on Summoner Rift KT will not be
3:54:03
denied and they will take the first Nexus of this series and with their final breath they take down the emperor
3:54:11
but his work was already done and I know this is just a game between KT and bro
3:54:17
and it's just game one it's just game one but the crowd is loving it as much as we are s oh this is payback that's
3:54:26
Payback right there for the ice cream gag yeah well hopefully he never does that again but it doesn't matter KT will
3:54:33
be successful here even if oh my God the Bros had have won KT would have at least
3:54:38
being 20% successful it's easy for KT BD don't die he don't he don't die except
3:54:44
for the end when he did die doesn't matter but BD also is an acronym for did die
3:54:50
so oh but it only works if he only dies once so thankfully still works right bdd
3:54:55
did die but also killed everyone else uh it continues it definitely continues so
3:55:01
really impressive stuff for KT to come back I do want to have a big shout out for k for bro as far as their early game
3:55:08
play they had that game in the bag Morgan was absolutely massive you can see this this just that's there you go
3:55:14
and then at 31 minutes is like the the roller coaster starts and once you're on there's no getting off Atlas yeah it was
3:55:20
a bit of Final Destination towards the end there not really what you wanted to see but 40 minutes of just Nonstop
3:55:26
Action huk managing to actually find some plays on leas in into poppy which is no mean feat to be perfectly honest
3:55:33
and looking back I wanted the least in pick but it wasn't exactly the right
3:55:38
least in spot with what was available there for KT which again like it I've
3:55:43
seen so many of these Lucid games yeah it's just the same thing it's the same thing and I want to see more of it I
3:55:50
don't want you to stop humo just continue it is time for us to stop though we're going to have to go to a short break when we get back the space
3:55:56
is going to break that one down we'll see what ice cream Deon has this time around and then we'll be getting into game number two see you there

4:03:30
hello everyone and welcome back to the space after a banger of a game it is KT
4:03:36
up 10 over the Bros Deon alongside wolf and W did and uh I would say
4:03:44
maybe not the greatest display of macro between these squads but a lot of hands a lot of hands here wolf I mean I think that some of the core parts of why bro
4:03:52
wasn't able to finish a game where they had a massive lead where they snowballed things really well is poor macro on one
4:03:57
hand but a lot of the gold they had was on an ambessa who had a massive gold lead but spent a majority of the time
4:04:02
building so in a sid Lane and not impacting team fights wasn't there for a lot of the the really important moments
4:04:08
and then tried to carry later but bdd just wouldn't be put down and they tried to flank him at the end end he had zonas
4:04:15
be's positioning phenomenal this game and some of the I think overaggressive Tendencies we saw from both the 80 carry
4:04:21
and support of bro backfired a lot in this game and bro weren't able to close it out we going to see the bolt dive but
4:04:27
after successful dive on the bolt side uh from bro I feel like it was really uh
4:04:33
easy game and one-sided but I mean just look at the leing play and the Synergy
4:04:39
between the naist it was really clean and after that uh unfortunately notas died after that but still it was really
4:04:47
massive lead by bro so it was quite impressive that they couldn't finish the
4:04:52
game by their lead they're just utilizing the fact that they have that 80 carry damage coming through from the
4:04:57
varus the execute coming through from hok I think a lot of this was super successful um because of the fact that
4:05:03
they had the vars into the Ezreal right they had that lane pressure the lane swap isn't enough Jace isn't very tanky
4:05:08
obviously and you're going to be able to if you can crush this Lane here uh get a massive Advantage right play through
4:05:15
where you have your strong point the Leon rotation the the timings there were incredible from hok mechanically though
4:05:22
great as well flashing for the E just a guarantee there's no way out yeah and from there lots of scraps for both sides
4:05:28
whether it was uh bro creating some space KT battling back all the way on up
4:05:33
to about 30 minutes here where we have uh Pro tips from wadid coming on in on
4:05:39
the telestrator he's going to break down the big flank that broke the hearts of bro fans and me yeah uh as we mentioned
4:05:47
I think we had the I mean they had the Great lead and the vision control by bro so they had no vision KT so it was
4:05:55
really rough to find out their way to walk into the Drake pit and I think that
4:06:00
was the timing that they could look for insane engage but I think PO he should look for just click the ultimate and
4:06:06
make it simple because they were collapsing on the other side as well so he could just flash on the one Target
4:06:13
and make it simple or he could look for UTI on Poppy and then like flash on our
4:06:19
flashh Flesh on here so he could look for multiple targets but he didn't do anything he could just like look for so
4:06:26
many simple targets but he what he did here you can play and just Q on the
4:06:32
front Lane and denied by poppy as well uh I think uh way this time he played
4:06:38
pretty well to deny the Nautilus but anyways I think it was really great plank by Morgan and huk in general but
4:06:46
uh with their leads and with their vision control it could be better and it
4:06:51
could be really like great team fight from bro but I think it didn't work out that well in this I think a big part of
4:06:57
this for me too wi is that I agree with you especially on the point of Pao uh where he chose to engage the lack of
4:07:04
flexibility for bro in this team fight because they were so hellbent on killing bdd their only game planed we kill bdd
4:07:11
closer goes in and ults basically so solo onto bdd bdd has zonas closer has
4:07:16
zonas burns his zonas to try to kill bdd you have the ambessa flank but instead like you said they could have just
4:07:21
looked for the front line they could have front to backed it be's positioning was so far back that trying to kill him in this situation was really just not
4:07:28
playing to your strengths not playing to your setup and bro need to be more flexible in these fights yeah as you mentioned I think even though like notus
4:07:34
Ed on air like he could back away and just chill out but that means that he's going to be out of the team fight and
4:07:40
ambessa could look for the behind uh look for the backline right so I think everything could be better if notas
4:07:47
played properly I feel like what I love about this when it came to the draft was that we had iconic the iconic Champion
4:07:54
pairing there azir with bdd something that he's made his name for and the Resurgence of closer here for bro has
4:08:00
been a lot on Aurora and not really checked here the clutch plays came down
4:08:05
to bdd he made it happen for the rest of KT all right wolf help me out here and
4:08:12
the rest of the Giga Chads and CH what a bro got to do here I I really just need to see cleaner team fighting you know I
4:08:18
think they got way too excited about the lead that they had and had a game plan in every fight but again flexibility
4:08:23
needs to be on the cards and closer off the Aurora bit of a concern he's looked so good on this pick but we'll see what
4:08:29
he looks like now that it's banned and fearless with final thoughts uh their Champion gives a lot of aggressiveness
4:08:34
like Le and poy and Aurora at the same time but maybe uh it's it looks a bit
4:08:39
harder for them to uh finish it out because it the the the team comp itself
4:08:45
is just a bit harder uh the difficulty is on point as well so I think maybe they need to change it to simple all
4:08:51
right a needed win for both these squads to get themselves back to 500 for the call let's send it back on over to our
4:08:58
ice cream afficianados chronicler
4:09:03
andalis thank you very much Deon and the Gang and yes some chill Bros in the
4:09:10
audience here and we'll see whether the Bros are indeed chill assume they are not um it seems no matter how many times
4:09:17
they lose how down they look they're still going to go for the crazy play and I really like that team fight breakdown
4:09:22
that they did on the space because I feel like that was sort of the epitome of bro it's trying to go for something
4:09:29
that isn't necessarily like you don't need to try that hard you don't you don't you can just play the game
4:09:36
actually with a lead that you had and it's it's probably going to be fine it's it's over complicating stuff right because what we saw there as well as we
4:09:43
High highed KT had so much disengage building to.com so if you do go to ham
4:09:48
you end up breaking it into like three separate fights uh none of which they won because all that gold was on one guy
4:09:55
and we can see ooh no Varys this time around if they do follow exactly the
4:10:01
same band so far scner hasn't been banned and that's lightning um yes
4:10:06
should be taken away H got to play a game of scarner that did happen it did and uh that was one of the games of
4:10:12
scarner of all time that uh was a win there I don't think he died in that game
4:10:18
that was also the only game that they won up until they obviously just demolished Chen g a two which is still
4:10:26
very funny as unfortunately for okay M bro it looks like in that
4:10:32
first game the clock did strike midnight and the magic kind of went away it did I
4:10:37
don't know whether the magic went away it was it was the magic was eclipsed by that guy on your screen right there
4:10:43
playing air and be when he is feeling it on air and we saw like it wasn't like
4:10:50
clutch it out in the right moments no B was just extremely good the entire game
4:10:56
well I mean I think he also CL I think he both he also CL just did no you can't call it clutch though when that was just
4:11:03
his state of being the entire time he was on the rift he's just always clutch all right well like I he's never letting
4:11:09
go of that clutch Atlas he's always up gears if you if you never letting go of the clutch you can't actually go anywhere you know it's how that works
4:11:17
okay that's a very good point I'm really considered that yeah I'll get back to you on that one okay we'll figure out I think we are in agreeance bdd absolutely
4:11:25
bdd good let's go with that bdd good everyone controversial opinion coming out from your friendly neighor Fosters
4:11:31
as the gets picked up here for huk fortunately there is no puppy to ruin his day oh renon NY give perfect a fun
4:11:39
game he did not have a fun game in that one and perfect effect to me is such a
4:11:45
cool story because every single thing we hear about this guy is how much he cares
4:11:50
how much he's grinding how much he's trying but I think that that actually is something that's kind of holding him
4:11:55
back right it's something that if you are playing too burdened by your own weight of Expectations by the pressure
4:12:01
that's on you it can really set you back in game feel like it's kind of if you compare I think perfect like last year
4:12:08
in the spring he was looking very very good in the last game
4:12:13
V theim it's Vitalia and I love the toia pickup because it is both I think one of
4:12:20
the Mages that closer play better except if when he jumps into multiple people please don't do that I've seen it happen
4:12:25
multiple times now and then it also takes away from bdd cuz BD's Tia is
4:12:31
crazy oh I no don't think Wukong into that I don't think Wukong is wuka no
4:12:36
that's yeah there we go cuz maybe they were hovering the Wukong to make people
4:12:41
think oh maybe that's leas jungle but it's yeah I think it's always going to be that bottom Lane that we saw
4:12:47
T1 absolutely demolished with earlier in the day this Caitlyn and Elise is kind
4:12:53
of gross that was smash who I think had a good Caitlyn gumas Caitlyn to get it
4:12:59
his death I think still stands alone yeah pretty sure that uh goom has done enough reps to really claim that title
4:13:05
we can we can we can safely uh safely put him up there together with our favorite opaka do do way I'm going to be
4:13:13
a little bit more reserved I think this Lane has a ton of power but it is very execution based way did really really
4:13:21
steep it up the team fights but the early game was if you're comparing let's just compare the first game to Way's
4:13:27
last series against T um I'd say a large
4:13:32
uh large Improvement Market Improvement for sure I think Elise is going to test a few of the issues that he had though
4:13:37
because he was going a little bit too ham and when you know when you chain die it's only Barrel that can still win
4:13:46
games just ahead of me I knew I could see it I could see it unbelievable as uh
4:13:52
we do have the kaisa and the ra taken away to make sure that there isn't too much Ste here we VI the kaisa is always
4:13:57
going to be on someone's mind is it going to be like what hype Jinx don't know about and you just swap
4:14:05
right like I know the lane is unplayable but I don't think there's a lot of lanes the alternative is you go like Zig just
4:14:11
go something with zero Lane interaction is wave clear zigs or seraphine comes to mind you have a lot of AD damage already
4:14:17
zigs toia feels a bit bad oh I agree I don't love it but I I'm trying to those are basically your options what about
4:14:23
you can't match in laning what if you just picked Yasuo gragas and then tried to dodge Lane Oh
4:14:30
you mean and then Wombo comboed everyone I mean you just flipped the lane level two right like that's of that yeah
4:14:36
Pantheon Le in no they can't play Le in oh that's a shame okay um Zyra going to be locked in for that's a big
4:14:44
oh it's be a y last pick and there's nothing they can do about it except for
4:14:49
have toer in mid lane already and that is pretty good into yon I don't like Jin just as a rule Jin
4:14:57
does have a large amount of range though so it might be all right poo going to be playing the Leona this time around and I
4:15:04
I think it's going to be yon and it's not going to be a so the only issue with the Yon is that I think
4:15:10
that yon into Chia feels a little better doesn't have to run over the
4:15:18
Rocks Way's hovering this for a really long time it's going to be y going to be like a it's fine yeah the reason we get
4:15:25
excited about Zed is because bdd was a well-known Zed one trick many years ago
4:15:31
um on his way to becoming a pro player yeah and so it's always really exciting
4:15:36
uh to see them hovering that I know like it's normally the excitement on T1 when
4:15:41
you see the Zed hovers and you're like oh my goodness it's him and Ryu again but no uh for me it's I see the BD ones
4:15:48
and I'm like I just want to see it for real cuz at least fake as we saw you know and he's was exceptionally good at
4:15:56
it one day one day chronicler one day we'll see it as what are you seeing as far as these drops I'm looking at KT and
4:16:02
I'm thinking that is terrifying and uh the Bros I'm feeling a
4:16:08
little less okay about I know okay man as you can see there okay man is feeling
4:16:13
real good about it I'm not so much no I'm looking at the Bro comp and
4:16:19
I feel like it's the same type of flavor but just not not as good not as
4:16:25
spicy as that if that makes sense yeah yeah yeah so I do think it's the type of game that you can really take over as
4:16:30
Jack so that's something at least but I'm looking at your lanes and I just don't I don't feel great about any of
4:16:36
them cuz like Jackson to reekon is one of those Lanes where you can outscale if you get an early kill or two and turn
4:16:43
that lane into a volatile then maybe but hok's going to need to do some really heavy lifting cuz I'm just oh my God I
4:16:50
feel like the setup with the Zyra the bot Lane that you need to avoid but no one can actually play into them it's
4:16:56
it's going to be a uphill battle all right it's time to get on the rift after that I've got something cool to talk about
4:17:10
[Music] oh KZ fans extraordinarily loud the
4:17:17
Brion fans you can sense a bit of added desperation Morgan and perfect just uh
4:17:22
going for a walk together which is quite nice Jack's walking his pet crocodile yeah Jack's level one is definitely it's
4:17:28
like well in this matchup I think especially level one as Jack you are so strong love this inade one of the big
4:17:34
things with Zyra wow you see this with champers like sheo as well is that their clear speed is someone relying on
4:17:40
allowing them to set up Y no set up can going slow them down a little bit not you know it's still Zyra and so you're
4:17:46
still not really going to be able to match her but yeah spotting Morgan once again so what I was going to talk about
4:17:51
is there was a fan sign okay that said that that had like the names of all of the KT players like sorry the first
4:17:58
initial of all the KT players on the roller coaster and it was like really cute and that reminded me of a uh Reddit
4:18:04
post about bdd just like basically being the CEO of KT and being the one guy that
4:18:09
they need and in the last game 100% he had the entire team on his back so why don't they just change up their roster
4:18:17
they can keep dock arm change their roster to Morgan Raptor bdd dock D and
4:18:25
duro because then those initials would just spell Mr BD which is absolutely
4:18:31
fantastic in my brain and now that it's sat for that long like I took such a long time to get to that point it feels
4:18:38
as stupid as it actually is it was sitting in my brain feeling cool though for a while thanks gon for that one as
4:18:43
you can see here uh this was what I was referring to um so let me know y or nay
4:18:49
whether that was D what I think at I think your mind works in mysterious ways
4:18:54
and that's why people enjoy listening to you and sometimes sometimes it's a hit do you think that team would be would be
4:19:00
very I don't think Raptors really had that much test uh so far yeah I'm just trying to figure out a
4:19:07
way to put Barrel in there uh I couldn't get it it's just that's just team Atlas actually it's not team BD
4:19:14
like oh no my name doesn't have a b in it so my team couldn't have baral either
4:19:19
I'm so doomed end no Morgan ass pack it up I know maybe we should I I should
4:19:25
just change my name okay what if we changed something with change to Mr
4:19:31
Max moo boy what are you talking about I just
4:19:36
need to have a b and an M for Barrel oh yeah um so mobo boy it is Hi I'm mobo
4:19:43
boy here to do some commentary I'm sorry for anybody else who's already called mobo boy um
4:19:50
but why is no one called Mo is MOA they don't it's not about the
4:19:56
mobas they're coming over from the motherboard forums they really like mobos what are the motherboard forums I
4:20:04
don't know just assume that's where mobo I thought that was a fe oh my God I
4:20:11
can't all right well anyway I'm moo boy this is chronicler and we are ready to get into it there's too many O's we
4:20:18
don't have Oscar in in here in the lck how many o players do we have I owner I've got an owner at least
4:20:26
as BD is going in closer taking so much damage and there it is the Snapback will
4:20:32
claim First Blood and will save the chat from that horrendous conversation that was lasting way too long hype down to
4:20:39
50% here on this bottom side of the map as we could understand with the Caitlin versus Jin matchup uh one can only
4:20:46
assume that closer was also listening to us and was distracted by that and was like what is going on uh cuz
4:20:52
unfortunately did die to the gank there also want to highlight the graphic that we saw thank you production that Zyra
4:20:58
has only lost except when it was cuz which has been pretty good at Zyra he
4:21:03
has been good at Zyra and it's also cuz is such an interesting jungler because I feel like he's so important to how his
4:21:09
team works but KT are very malleable I don't feel like
4:21:14
they play one style that makes sense with T1 something I always talk about is owner on something like n or Zyra I just
4:21:20
don't I think it's like it's where Carri comes from in a team and I think you're right with this and did he land the as
4:21:27
well but it was because bdd Flash Q3 so like it's bdd that sets it up I mean
4:21:33
yeah it it always comes back to to the m bdd um one day to Mr bdd one day that
4:21:41
that uh that team will exist and it'll be absolutely fantastic cannot
4:21:47
wait um but anyway we need to find another o player I'm going for Mr bdd
4:21:52
now so we have Morgan yeah Morgan Raptor BD Doc and dur ah okay I was thinking
4:21:58
about Dove I'm like what's he up to bring it back he's probably just I
4:22:05
reckon he'd have an incredible career in audio books his voice his voice is
4:22:11
mesmerizing it you're exactly right it's beautiful and it's so funny cuz one of the situations where you see Dove and he
4:22:18
just he just likes he just likes looks like a lead l escap it's an average guy and then you hear him talk seismic shove
4:22:24
avoided there by bdd because he didn't actually quite find closer with that button no he was listening to us as well
4:22:31
oo face off as we do have a little bit of a face off here in the middle we do have hype already ahead of the play dock
4:22:38
is towards the bot side so bro could theoretically overload would have to pay pretty heavily there was do yeah I think
4:22:45
uh Morgan just decides doing the walk around it strategy never heard of that one just needs another leap strike in
4:22:51
power so that's going to get the flash out from do yeah understandable and to grab some grubs
4:22:59
but it doesn't really matter I would have loved for them to I think the problem here was that even though dock
4:23:04
down did mess up by the time that Morgan would have been there with what do you call Turtle
4:23:09
Port the play was already kind of done the if it was Herold I think Morp there and that can smash that fight
4:23:16
unfortunately this does mean that the struggle continues the problem is is
4:23:21
that vidity is really utilizing this early advantage that he picked up quite well you might be seeing it and being
4:23:26
like Oh but it's you know CS is still even uh Clos can still Farm the problem is is that this is the part where the
4:23:33
the Yon should be having the most trouble and um you know then just waiting for that blade of the ruin King
4:23:39
where he's going to be happy finally but he's already happy he is really happy Atlas great gold lead sitting on the
4:23:46
kill level lead as well those extra stats are rough I do remember when tiia was basically a must pick that was at
4:23:53
the time she was also getting Flex to Jungle uh it it was the situation where eventually yon started coming up and in
4:23:59
theory you're like but why cuz he can Dash like he is so riing on Dashers and tiia blocks them but Tia's e is very
4:24:06
stationary and yon has so many waiting at different angles so he can just kind of bypass it and if you ever mess up as
4:24:12
we for closer earlier and he's on top of you you do just yeah I mean the problem is toa's whole kit is skill shot
4:24:19
basically and if you don't hit the abilities then you don't do anything at all and for yon specifically I think he
4:24:25
has so many ways so many ways to make it incredibly hard to play yeah as we can
4:24:31
see just there even if he doesn't doesn't get a kill which he did so things are worse uh before it's
4:24:39
atas it's an almost 2K gold leader 8 minutes which is pretty silly like I I feel like we're already getting dangerously off track and this is not
4:24:45
helping yeah the problem is that we had a bad track record today it we have been easily distracted um it is Sunday it is
4:24:53
Sunday and it's almost holiday season as well here in Korea so we're just trying to keep that energy alive as B eats a
4:24:59
lot of rocks that was a you don't want to eat that many rocks as a man who's knocked out his two front teeth don't
4:25:05
eat that many rocks it was ashall it it wasn't technically rocks but blading iue yeah
4:25:12
yeah of course it was quite some time ago and these teeth are doing great for me now as all right KT going to look for
4:25:19
the first dragon that will mean that they grab their first third of a sandal and that's their second one they're
4:25:24
already walking real happy on one of their feet uh perfect he's going to try to
4:25:31
fight Morgan here a little bit wanted to bait out that Counterstrike you could feel it right didn't want to press the ruthless Predator button understandable
4:25:37
it's sort of how the game play goes but just naturally I think the renekton's going to be feeling all right in this
4:25:42
match up at least for now we have humach shadowing H and Pao who are just
4:25:47
straight up proxying could look for a free fre or cuz is his ultimate though he's two levels up Atlas yeah that's 27
4:25:56
CS that's exactly what we're talking about yeah huk is not quite finding and
4:26:02
look at that moment in time it was the same numbers but they were ordered the opposite way which is kind of crazy Ruth
4:26:08
spread speaking of witch is actually going yeah no counter
4:26:13
he should know these you know this match up should be known by Morgan is okay we're alting underneath the turret as BD
4:26:18
there's the walk out of the way as he wants it but he won't get it and the turret shot not going to be enough to take down BD either as they trade flash
4:26:26
for Flash we'll see who that's going to benefit in upcoming fights not quite enough damage there from BD I think
4:26:33
missed one kill that could have been a Difference Maker or closer flash it we'll have to see the replay yeah going
4:26:39
back to the Top Lane match up perfect for all of his fault is an insane
4:26:44
Renekton uh cuz this we knew this because he was getting banned every single playoffs game in summer and then
4:26:50
he did kind of struggle but if he did get redon boy oh boy and I think we're seeing that here again actually looking
4:26:56
so much more comfortable on the champion I think that Comfort is just it the confidence is are such a big
4:27:02
thing particularly when you're playing against a player like Morgan who uh as far as we're aware is just grimming with
4:27:08
confidence at any point is this is going to be really hard to approach the traps flash cocoon though from we try and get
4:27:13
rid of clo but it may not necessarily be enough hok though will launch his way forward they get rid of the Zyra before
4:27:20
she can hold such a big deal way going to be taken out here trying and get a little bit of something back is now dock
4:27:26
arm dived in on by all of the pros and after some really weird team fights in
4:27:33
the last game that was beautifully orchestrated so well done there hok
4:27:40
finds his Mark the time around able to take down cousin as we often say if Zyra
4:27:47
gets a rotation of who cares but he legitimately did not cost a spell there just got blown up not able to do any
4:27:54
damage so we take another look so it starts up with way and it's actually I think way that inadvertently creates the
4:28:01
opening for huk to go in cuz he's going in EN closer uh H also got full value um
4:28:08
out of he hit every shot oh yeah which is just a lot of damage and then I mean this point duck down like he it's a
4:28:14
really nice trap from from closer but let's be let's be real he was dead already perfect also didn't have the teleport available so couldn't really
4:28:20
join the fight so he was just pushing away as oh Morgan oh cuz going to sweep
4:28:29
him out here get some plants in the area does find the grasping Roots as Morgan is not going to be dead or anything just
4:28:36
uh didn't quite have enough juice left to uh go Toe to Toe understandably so there will just be out to go grubs were
4:28:44
not taken only one was taken there I think by KT in that
4:28:49
exchange and also closer now actually sitting a gold parody with BD thanks to that Skirmish of the Bros keeping us in
4:28:56
it is perfect he wants to find this tur but is going to be found instead seismic shove does come through slicing is
4:29:02
dangerous because there's rocks he didn't take a lot of damage though yeah I think he's going to be all right does
4:29:09
have his Black Cleaver completed already as well so one completed item versus is Morgan's almost done uh Trinity fors I
4:29:15
remember when you know when you hit level four on toia you could just one combo someone oh God that was a thing
4:29:22
that's why I also like toia panion existed used to do a whole lot of things
4:29:28
that were very silly the amount of AOE on a q as well back in the day yeah okay that I'm okay with that that being gone
4:29:35
but like that definitely should be gone that should have been gone but yeah like and to be fair closer was also gone for
4:29:41
like he he he has archangels and and theity he's not he's not building damage
4:29:47
he's building to have a lot of up time on his e and to stay alive when he inadvertedly gets Dove by perfect or bdd
4:29:54
or way but it still hurts me as a big fan of tiia to see that H got the W at
4:30:02
the end there so wow that's rude also the uh as in theole that's fine he still
4:30:07
had a Clips up when that came through so wasn't too bad oh ways moving down looks
4:30:13
like closer is what they're looking for BD trying to deal with this wave as quickly as possible as another one does
4:30:19
Cong line in for them h on theow and I think KT realized that they
4:30:25
gave bro too much time to prepare and so therefore they are going to back away from the situation I think quite
4:30:32
intelligent another BR fight perhaps they can do have hype set up pretty safe
4:30:38
and another potential hex tech dragon as well are they going to let it go it's going to be a cloud Soul oh baby okay
4:30:45
I'm going to pull the trigger there I think they were getting kind of in position with closer going up to
4:30:52
River just gets the E and plays it off deadly flourish does connect but doesn't
4:30:57
really do too much as perfect Morgan continuing to go Toe to Toe this time perfect is the one with a gigantic CS
4:31:03
lead 1.1 atas yeah uh the shoe is well and truly on the other foot or the sandal is on the other
4:31:10
foot I guess well there hasn't been any sandals yet well not yet but they're trying to build
4:31:16
the second pair like they very close there one for for KT yeah perfect completely dominant but
4:31:24
he needs to have an impact beyond that right that's the big thing needs to actually join these fights and make his presence known cuz eventually in this
4:31:31
game he is just going to be a handbag not to be confused with hbag who's on the enemy team yeah um because he will
4:31:36
be trying to play into a ton of CC and AIA and a Jax items you can actually
4:31:42
like peel for Caitlyn relatively well as as a Renekton being a big body yeah you can stand there menacingly yeah but it
4:31:49
doesn't feel as good as how strong you're right now especially with meron where you just q and the entire enemy
4:31:55
backline just kind of evaporates and they don't have any other way to just sort of Brute Force something other than
4:32:02
perfect go walk at them um uh we also have way please cocoon someone yeah we
4:32:08
do have that one as he does repel out of the uh seismic shot so he passes that test quite
4:32:15
nicely and do going to be clearing out that wave and then moving on over it looks like a fight for Shell might be
4:32:21
coming in as there's a beautiful stun on the C and this time he manages to press
4:32:26
a button I just don't know whether it's going to be enough great knock up from BD is po will be going down but they're
4:32:32
waiting for him to come back to his soul that seismic shot where was that going very confusing button press as bdd is
4:32:38
going to have to flash away there he is yeah perfect here's that handbag that you were requesting as he flashes on top
4:32:45
of closer and closer flashes away huk now fighting against PDD and PDD is
4:32:50
going to win those and now Doom they're fishing a barrel he flashes one and The
4:32:55
Peacemaker doesn't land still KT a much better experience outside of uh the lamp
4:33:02
post that is just wrapping on this turret in the bottom Lane I I actually I
4:33:07
think that was favorable for bro yeah cuz they didn't actually get that many kills and and Morgan got first tur blood
4:33:14
yeah that that is a fe of strength well perfect okay no it's 100 look they used
4:33:20
so many flashes they got they got what they got uh they got CZ as well they got
4:33:26
wey KT then invested heavily I guess they're going to get the herald a which is definitely a bit of a win but like
4:33:32
the gold Le no but they've already got first turret and the main reason Herold feels so good is he can use it to get
4:33:37
said first turret I think it's still good for Mid to get the mid but I I know I'm just saying it's not as good as it
4:33:43
could have otherwise yeah I I don't know I think the state before was a bit it definitely was good for Morgan because
4:33:49
perfect invested heavily and didn't really get anything out of it he did save the rest of his team and
4:33:55
I think BD would have definitely died if there wasn't a crocodile to be worrying about it wasn't his fault in this
4:34:01
instance I think the teleport was definitely correct but it's just unfortunate if they get like two more
4:34:06
kills on bro there then it's 100% worth cuz like dock D flashing perfect flashing CL are actually getting a crazy
4:34:13
amount of value with the T at you there I actually think cuz should just build ri's full tank dude this this genin is
4:34:20
actually such yeah exactly and perect taking so much damage from him as well oh the last bullet and that's what
4:34:26
happens when you just hit every bullet of the curtain call I thought crocodiles were a
4:34:33
protected Animal Atlas not protected enough my friend not protected enough and not all of them you know it depends
4:34:39
which species and it depends which country you're in things like this um but this crocodile was definitely not
4:34:46
protected I'm so happy you're here to unlight me on crocodile L thank you very much all I know is are an apex predator I don't really and you know they're a
4:34:53
dinosaur which is very cool unchanged for literally isn't it Millions wide
4:34:58
change Perfection yeah millions and millions unreal as we do take a look here this is just crazy like the fact
4:35:05
that Morgan while all of this is happening is also just completely unbothered getting a turret fact that I
4:35:11
think perfect feels relatively safe but it's pressive no I know it it's like KT took a nap look at
4:35:19
this this too is KT yeah and this is exactly the gold graph just sped up a
4:35:25
little bit from last time we need a third game atas oh we're going to get a third game and you best believe it is
4:35:32
going to be the same thing it's just back and forth and no one really knows what's going on yep yeah I'll sign up
4:35:39
for that you'd have to put them at exactly the same point on a power ranking that's that's that's what I want
4:35:45
this series to be so all right Bros let's get it together team fighting
4:35:50
needs to be crisper than last series though that's a big test for them every fight that they've managed to to win
4:35:57
this time around has been kill cuz instantly and I think they're going to be really worried if cuz manages to
4:36:03
survive he's in range but not going to be able to lock this one down has to flash to the deadly flourish and now another curtain has been called perfect
4:36:11
yeah I'd be sliced in out of that one still going to be blocking for his carries as Morgan trying to dash away as
4:36:16
the Weaver wall going to be put I don't know about that engage follow it's a bit dangerous as they get on top of way Ace
4:36:22
in the Hole comes through bdd dashes back Morgan pushed out of the fight once again and KD holding onto the fail lank
4:36:28
bro you don't need to be here you've got the Drake it's like you did the it's fine yeah Pi a death and they do not
4:36:36
going to be more than getting that Dragon will be giving up the Lane turret
4:36:42
here yeah Aon just spawning as well as the real Yaky sacks going to be
4:36:50
occurring after that this is I I actually love Aon being added into the game just because I I think it
4:36:56
guarantees Insanity even if it's not necessarily the greatest strategic objective you know like and the way our
4:37:02
teams have been using what I mean it gets the people going and it also makes the game extraordinarily volatile and
4:37:10
that's what we want in bro versus KT yeah I think normally we don't have enough volatility in KT games so I'm
4:37:15
really happy that they can provide that as he guess what bro just starting it up bro activity Atlas oh yeah and they
4:37:22
can't turn this into a baron because they're basically starting it on spawn BD is moving over but he's Unbound his
4:37:27
soul so he's just scouting control Wards going up going down as we is just
4:37:32
wandering past as there is a Teleport from perfect oh God okay The Flash Forward
4:37:38
way is just going to pop and C is in range that Smite who's going to get it it's cuz as KT can now just ruthlessly
4:37:47
walk forward slicing dysing acting all cool perfect just shakes off that game
4:37:53
number one and he is going to be able to dice his way out he he will die here
4:37:58
unless he flashes he decides not to and by die I mean just go home for a bit before he comes back out again and yeah
4:38:04
Deon unfortunately alongside the uh bro levers they're not going to be sad
4:38:10
because a true brever gigachad does not care about outcome they care about the
4:38:17
team we are not about results based analysis here when it comes toow as W
4:38:23
goes in just kind of dies but guess what he bought the space turns into a mess
4:38:28
all that matters is the Smite and cuz does get this one because his opponent was dead um and then from there on
4:38:37
out they just kind of clean up I I'm just so confused Atlas I feel like
4:38:43
bro did actually have the tools to keep him out there I mean it was a 50/50 they kind of just 5050 the game a bit not not
4:38:52
a bit like a lot a lot yeah I guess maybe it wasn't on that cuz oh well it
4:38:58
was on no Morgan Morgan andollo had one job which is do not let CZ get through
4:39:03
Tri rush because that is a Zyra this is not it's not Lee it's it's not Zach
4:39:09
that's a it's a slow walking the walking animation of Zyra just yeah and they
4:39:14
they see they found her there the deadly FL is not going to connect wey is oh okay I mean you waited a very long time
4:39:21
for that repel my friend is he still dead no okay we don't we don't know yeah if going to land all of the buttons then
4:39:29
away closer is splitting on the top side Morgan holding the wave towards the bottom side as we have 40 seconds left
4:39:36
on this Aon buff I don't think we've had enough ups and downs in this game yet yeah yeah it's been a real flat roller
4:39:44
coaster py is due for know what maybe give up a baron so I actually had a recommended video on my YouTube today
4:39:51
that was someone making a gigantic coil in Roller Coaster Tycoon and I actually
4:39:58
kind of think like that's what this series is looking like a coil so it just like circles inwards yeah okay but it's
4:40:05
like Galaxy uh scale it was very very very is that one of those things where
4:40:10
like theoretic you could program a computer if you could do something like that I actually don't really know people
4:40:16
have like I don't understand roll Coaster Tycoon meta is something that I am just I'm only at the tip of the
4:40:22
iceberg of but there is a there is a lot there is a lot there you guys have to understand it Atlas is one of those guys
4:40:28
that can just go on Rants and you're like what are you even it's like I just watched him earlier today there talking
4:40:34
about what was it another gcha game is oh oh PD dice into the backline he's decided closer is over
4:40:41
and he's not just yet and W's actually going to have this one turned on him close down the spider and BD just
4:40:49
couldn't get it done and killed his support is that I they might get dragon enough of that oh the twos and the
4:40:57
froze the ups and the Downs please please I need you to the loops and the
4:41:02
loops Chron if they can push in mid and they can even rotate to Baron I think the problem is that this going to go
4:41:07
down very quickly they need to threaten they're not okay Morgan is threatening okay there's the wall all right they're
4:41:14
going to try and steal this one away it's B that locks down the Drake somehow but meanwhile they found do and Perfect
4:41:20
by themselves perfect trying to protect the president but Morgan says not on my
4:41:25
watch buddy there's the flick back from closer and perfect May survive but his
4:41:31
ad8 carry will not as Mr nervous on back of the screen BD is on a ward he's being
4:41:37
spotted Polo has as well though and now BD is going to have to try and find a way out po I don't thinking that one is
4:41:44
the way to do it and I don't know about unbinding the soul there b as po just trying to bait him in to having a good
4:41:50
time but the double knock up going to be fantastic B does so much damage way comes over he knocks them up again takes
4:41:56
down huk and that means no jungler that means Stock's going to be alive and that
4:42:02
means KT can walk to Baron oh God I think next time we put on
4:42:09
Deon cam can we just put it upside down um just because I feel like this game is just
4:42:16
turning our whole worlds around they they killed dockum and they
4:42:21
got perfect Summoners and then they no not br oh on
4:42:28
the KT side sorry yeah yeah yeah no like they lose dock arms and then they invest
4:42:34
a whole lot do not let them get this I don't know you got to go in it can't end like this the crab at it
4:42:42
it can't endend like this I mean it it the baron is going to end like that chronic I can't I can't figure out a way
4:42:48
to fix that however they will take the mid out of turret is it just a clean two
4:42:54
nothing to see here oh the most KT thank you for coming back score because I feel
4:42:59
like that Meme hadn't been honored truly enough uh throughout last year no
4:43:05
there's no way Kitt is going to find a way to to throw this they have to actually who I Kitty is it no it's not a
4:43:10
throw though bdd is silly and we thought that last game was actually BD's promos
4:43:16
but he's only two and two now oh no this is the decider in the promos so what
4:43:22
what happens here and again I want to highlight like they could have probably killed
4:43:29
cuz I mean Jak gets the walk out cuz was stuck in the pit as Zyra he just gets
4:43:36
the walk out Atlas he probably just pretended to be a plant yeah it clearly
4:43:41
works and then here uh unfortunately for pao the bdds is Seven Levels up on him
4:43:48
and then the fact that H gets his Q cancelled and then gets clipped by way arriving just in time that was supposed
4:43:55
to be the moment to kill BD 100% they get Nash cuz that is old gold that is so much of the damage and instead well
4:44:02
they're not even that far behind that's the thing that really gets me it's like 2K it's only like 2 and 1/2k this game
4:44:07
is not that big a deal like there is no no think KT are in the lead
4:44:13
theoretically and they have soul point that is you know permanently going to be there you know what this is I don't see
4:44:19
this Baron doing very much it really is it feels like we're on like the e g eth game of a nine gamer yeah when this is
4:44:27
our fourth game of today and I don't know how that happened going to face check he's going
4:44:33
to be out to flash away does have the Vault break it's okay it's fine he flashed out well now do is going to be
4:44:40
able to cleans way taking a lot of damage but he's got repel but he moved forward I don't know about that one he is well and truly Dead Morgan diving on
4:44:47
top of do and the bullets AR raining through they deadly flourish from hype is so good and Morgan will just put a
4:44:54
lamp post and say no not today hype is the least useless gin I
4:45:01
have ever seen in my life my God but there's no objective right and
4:45:10
well the the red B Baron power play does end with -300 so that uh no so it starts on plus
4:45:17
15 doesn't it so they lost 3K um in that passage of play that is going
4:45:24
to even out the gold uh okay so we're going to have the soul fight as we take
4:45:30
it a look as hug lul all of us including KT into a full sense of security as
4:45:38
Morgan has an amazing flank do um doesn't really have a way out there
4:45:43
stays alive for so much longer than he should but he does get killed eventually and then on the flip side BD just
4:45:50
doesn't quite have the damage to take down Closer Closer does actually go for a really tanky build poo is there get
4:45:57
the E on the return and I think Morgan doing a lot of heavy lifting there he is only going to
4:46:04
be bigger and bigger didn't even have to burn his stopwatch there or arm guard I guess as there we go
4:46:11
we had the mini the mini occurrence right of what we saw last time but it
4:46:18
just didn't get off the ground now bro you're going to have to carry this forward if you want to make the dream a
4:46:23
reality okay KT you can give I want to repeat KT you can give up this Dragon do you have you have three Dres but do you
4:46:30
want to KT well they're clearly want to give up clear not going to at you could also get Cloud Soul which is very cool
4:46:37
they have position as well cuz is in the banana brush as H is spotted on Vision that cocoon went to nania and this wall
4:46:45
is going to split up the entirety of KT they dive into the back line but they get over the wall hok is going to
4:46:50
explode Morgan a beautiful Zas keeps him alive but Do's position is so good
4:46:56
headshot number one is going to ring ring true onto the top laner of the Bros
4:47:01
and unfortunately that was not their team fight and KT will get the soul and
4:47:08
once again the hot palpitation will continue oh you can't Sona against the
4:47:14
cadin if and expect to live he at least didn't take a lot of damage from strangle
4:47:21
forms so uh Brion tried to collapse but I'm pretty sure that like we went up in
4:47:27
the air it was the way they got over the wall let's see I think it was docon that
4:47:33
netted did he net no he just walk yeah so there's just not enough through right so like Morgan goes
4:47:40
in but there's no follow up like closer isn't there huk just immediately dies
4:47:45
hype is in a position to follow up so like Morgan goes in and it's not his fault but like to kind of encapsulate
4:47:52
one of their strongest members goes in counter strikes doesn't get anything stopwatches trap goes down and he just
4:47:58
dies yeah and uh hyp has the same gin build that rer had uh in their match that they
4:48:05
lost against bro um which maybe could have told him something but uh he has been making it
4:48:11
work I'm not going to doubt hype at all this time around you can see second on damage de it's still not done Atlas this
4:48:16
it's absolutely not it's good but it's not it's not ax stack it doesn't instantly win you the game and as well
4:48:23
like I actually kind of like the Gin build here just cuz there's no tank so you may as well just go full zappy zap
4:48:30
well he's he's about to finish his Lord DS yeah cuz there is perfect with he's got some health on him uh a lot yeah of
4:48:37
resistances there oh yeah true he's building a bunch of armor yeah which he should because I closer damage is just
4:48:44
not really going to face perfect Baron number two baby let's see whether KT can do better than losing 3,000 gold after
4:48:51
picking up the bar it seems like the call is just pretend it doesn't exist and guess what it's work the did so much
4:48:58
damage he back he is just dead he knew he was dead so he had to try and do what he could and what he could was
4:49:07
die oh perfect is going to jump onto hyp here does get the cleanse out and Morgan
4:49:14
this is solo que this is this just solo que well the turet is going to go down and is going to turn up we gets in here
4:49:22
seic sh connects as BD alss his way out there we're unable to block it could have actually held on to him there as
4:49:29
bdd oh wants to find closer just gets out of the way is perfect oh okay let's
4:49:34
see whether he can kill him and the answer is absolutely yes he can in the meantime they take the baron as well
4:49:40
that's what cousin doam were cooking up in the other room and po I don't think
4:49:46
he's getting away from this bdd yon on his fifth game of promos as Morgan
4:49:52
trying to run for the hills the smallest leap strike the saddest leap strike will lead him to the death chamber as he is
4:49:59
diced into 100 pieces and KT they're winning again and it looks
4:50:05
like this time is the final time today
4:50:12
all right it's a clean two Z nothing to see here Morgan the Christ guys I was
4:50:18
split pushing why did you join me just let me split push alone and uh the Jokes
4:50:23
Aside they try to kill BD if they kill BD there does an angle but guess what that man only goes down when he deems it
4:50:30
worthy and a clean to0 for KT nothing to see here
4:50:37
whatsoever and perfect as well I just want to say the last like 7 Minutes of
4:50:43
that game I could feel the catharsis for that man who had a horrible game one
4:50:49
really even though they won he wasn't psyched about it and I think I actually spotted a
4:50:55
smile on his face as he was walking over you see there's a there's a little bit of a grin because his Renekton looked
4:51:03
just he was an assassin at the end of that game it's great to see group Elder
4:51:08
will now confirm that they are in first place the only thing the teams are
4:51:14
competing for now is seeding going into the plins or the playoffs and who is
4:51:19
going to be in last place on ingroup Baron and right now that is being K
4:51:27
FX heads officially on The Chopping blockers my God bdd what an exceptional
4:51:33
performance today bdd MBT what oh he oh it's it's MBT is he's
4:51:41
the goat ah nbti is goat is that an mbti no of
4:51:46
course of course not Atlas then what does mbti have to do with it why don't you just call him the goat what I don't
4:51:53
know because that's part of the joke I didn't say it was a good joke that's a bit weird um but maybe I'm just old Jon
4:52:01
just called me a boomer but that's my parents and it's probably not uh people that call people Boomers parents because
4:52:09
yeah I'm old okay what did KT mean by this is what I want to know oh they just meant we want you
4:52:15
guys to have a really entertaining day and uh we'll see you next time for whatever we're going to bring wey looks
4:52:22
way better today I'm not even I know again it's really hard just like both way way perfect on a team there's so
4:52:31
many bad jokes that can be made but I I do really think that he ended up being very pivotal even and as I say that just
4:52:38
cuts to him getting uh up immediately here the 50/50 going to cuz uh but I do actually think way
4:52:45
stepped it up today which is nice he wasn't the main character though there was only one main character on the
4:52:50
rift today yeah and his name was B I just want to confirm I know what an mbti is no I know you know yeah but I just
4:52:57
don't think it worked at all never mind it's just four
4:53:02
letters Jon explained it and I don't want to repeat it it makes me sad it
4:53:08
does make sense though yeah it's cuz it's four letters it's like it's like saying my spirit
4:53:14
animal is whatever something like that love cute label s yeah yeah and I guess
4:53:20
that's F I don't want to take that away I I I can't just be the the the the guy yelling at the people on the lawn you
4:53:25
know not I do think you have a great yell so uh I'll give you that one as
4:53:31
there was a moment of Hope here for the Bros there were multiple moments of Hope for the bros man Bros series the whole
4:53:38
series was just uh I don't know I think Deon might be in hospital I don't know who's going to be host it is a clear
4:53:43
sign again that if they deem the other team worthy of the win that they will just give it yeah you don't take win
4:53:50
from the Bros they give it to you in in multiple well their fate is often decided by themselves and themselves
4:53:56
alone and uh I hope that never changes they are so fun to
4:54:03
watch let's have a listen you can see they are certainly all business here we
4:54:09
might have been a whole lot of fun it might have sounded like they were having a whole lot of
4:54:14
fun uh but this is all business here as they look to take down these Nexus
4:54:20
turrets go slow go slow turn turn turn then kill the Nexus and hug tried to do
4:54:26
something with the buttons that he had left and bdd look at that that is a man that looks like his back is sore okay we
4:54:35
didn't get the we didn't get the perfect vote for owner surely this is this this
4:54:41
is an 11 out of 11 oh yeah for [Music]
4:54:47
perfect I can't even say it's been a long day cuz it hasn't it's been a 2020 I feel like I've
4:54:54
been here my whole life my God what a perfect we need there
4:55:00
it is and it came up so quickly did you notice like we must have had enough votes to give it to BD pretty quick this
4:55:06
this is a this is a perfect ending to the first two week of lck cup I wouldn't want to add it the other way this is
4:55:12
exactly the type of match that we should have oh yeah 82 and 23 for the man in
4:55:17
the mid lane for KT the CEO as was put so beautifully and eloquently on Reddit
4:55:23
as well my God what a series I know it was a two but we got enough League of
4:55:28
Legends out of that one I reckon you know thank you you know how sometimes you feel like you just weren't given enough like after game one of the
4:55:35
Telecom War where it was just scanner existed and it was over this was too games League of Legends well and
4:55:43
truly that's a High Praise
4:55:48
GI happy Sal everyone as well I hope you guys have a lovely holiday if you're here in Korea otherwise um I hope you
4:55:56
why oh I'm M boy I did it I get to be I get to be Morgan and Barrel oh man my my
4:56:03
day turned around so far still say you could have just been MOA boy which would have made so much sense no I'm MO boy
4:56:11
anyway it's time for the interview let's have a chat to
4:56:18
B thank you very much guys this is here for the lck cup P interview translation
4:56:24
joined by bdd on the side of KT rolster
4:56:30
[Music] congratulations with KT's Victory today
4:56:36
group Elder is officially the winner with his 13th how do you
4:56:43
feel you know I'm just being able to see that we haven't been a nuis to group out
4:56:50
there makes me really happy never fails to get his job done in
4:56:56
game one you had an incredible performance with the SE and the game wasn't actually going too easy for you
4:57:01
so what was the game plan you lately the game hasn't been very easy it was it was pretty tough but
4:57:10
I felt like I had a feeling that if I play a Zer that I would actually be able to take at least one win so I think that
4:57:16
was really what we did to deal with the
4:57:21
game and in game you hovered for a bit and the
4:57:27
analyst said that that seems pretty viable so did you think that y was just a better
4:57:33
pick you know it's just happens to be not as good uh in team fighting so I
4:57:39
think that's why I ended up going Y which helps the team on the long run and so you had an amazing Y game
4:57:48
play getting the job done again in game two so what did you think about today's
4:57:55
series you know I think it wasn't easy but we were able to make it a victory in
4:58:01
the very end so I think that's just something that we still still need to work on but it makes me happy
4:58:07
still and now group Elder will have to compete with for the higher placing with
4:58:12
each other how how do you think of that in terms of our teamwork and
4:58:18
Synergy there's a lot to work on to reach our true potential so I believe
4:58:23
that we have uh pretty much a homework that we need to work on and many fans are watching you both
4:58:31
in person and online so if you have any holiday messages to them now before you take a break I'm
4:58:38
really glad that we were able to show you Victory and bring you one a happy one and I hope that you guys all have a
4:58:44
happy Sun Life and that's the end of the interview with BBD and back to the space
4:58:49
thank you welcome back to the space KT take it
4:58:57
two over the Bros clean two nothing to see here Deon alongside wolf and what
4:59:03
did what did is beaming right now why are you beaming wud I mean I'm not beaming I'm just smiling you know I mean
4:59:09
we happy games yeah that's that's beaming why aren't you why aren't you hurting a little
4:59:15
bit I um I'm hurting a little bit myself because
4:59:21
I we had two very winnable games for bro they had a massive lead in game one in
4:59:26
game two they took back a little bit of control and still made a lot of really bad calls around setting up for
4:59:33
objectives and in team fights themselves and I feel like we might just have to start categorizing as we did before the
4:59:39
tournament started bro is a dominant early game team who struggles to make the right calls in the mid to late game
4:59:46
which is what bro has basically been since 2021 when we started franchising dominant is not the right word for early
4:59:51
game they were an okay early game team and okay man brro early game team and now they are pretty pretty good pretty
4:59:59
good okay yeah we'll we'll we'll see how um they can transition it is a unanimous
5:00:05
uh vote for bdd which I think is good to see because this is a very obviously
5:00:11
dominant performance from bdd in this series like even in the first game when things were all falling apart and things
5:00:18
were very much going arai he only died at the end when closer like flashed to kill him um and this is why I always
5:00:24
keep a bottle of 1999 bdd classic I'm always saving it I've been I
5:00:31
haven't drank it yet because I'm saving it for B winning worlds you know it hasn't happened yet but I'm I'm holding
5:00:37
on to it what do you mean what's that F that's BD that's bdd classic font that's like being like when coca colola comes
5:00:43
up be like what's that font it's bdd classic how do you not know this come on me uncultured thank you for teaching me
5:00:49
a North American all right go ahead with d yeah I mean as wolf mentioned uh I
5:00:55
think even though KT won two it was not really that clean game but I think the
5:01:01
only one player uh that bdd was having a great game with his azir and yon once
5:01:07
again a classic never gets old so I think yeah never so I think it was really great performance by bdd and
5:01:14
really classic font also never gets old all right let's see what cronnie had to say he was feeling uh uh quite The
5:01:20
Lyricist right now no big three just me just big me yeah big big me yeah big me
5:01:27
he was big he was big b stands for um I want bdds uh azir
5:01:37
soldiers like Fair yeah fair enough
5:01:42
how much more can he I mean seriously like how much more could he do he was doing the most in in both those games we
5:01:49
have one more usually we have three one more coming up oh no that is it time for
5:01:55
highlights that's a that's a Deon classic yeah that was that was definitely a Deon class confusing we're going to have yet another one of those
5:02:03
Pro tips with W did as he breaks down an early game team fight in game number two
5:02:09
where maybe the Bros can learn a thing or two yeah I think uh in this case KT had a great lead you can already see it
5:02:15
from the from this side uh KT only need to deny one uh void grubby cuz they had
5:02:23
they already got the two so denied one points and also if you just get one and get back uh they cannot get the point as
5:02:30
well uh point of defeat so in this case you can see from the mini map Jax was actually coming towards void grubs as
5:02:37
well while Ron has no TP on the both side so I think instead of doing this
5:02:43
they could just kite back the void grops and pathing towards here to make it safe and deny the fysal uh strength as well
5:02:51
because you already blocked the path from here with the K traps so it was kind of easy plan for KT but instead of
5:02:58
that I think they kind of overcommitted and messed up a little bit here you can
5:03:04
play here and you could see uh this connection from way and the team and I
5:03:10
think that kind of placed KT in a really bad uh situation and I think that kind
5:03:16
of LED Bros Ali game a huge lead from the Bros early game here yeah this is a
5:03:22
big problem for KT rollster in this one like you said a big disconnect and you know we is obviously the least
5:03:28
experienced player on this team Perfect's had a a lot of time uh with this roster and and a lot of time under
5:03:34
his belt but still some of those Jitters when you're playing Elise you're always thinking who can I flash towards to
5:03:39
cocoon because that often just guarantees a kill but if you haven't communicated that communicated that to your team or your target is too far away
5:03:46
from your teammates then it can create some problems I want to talk Deon about the last moments of this game because
5:03:52
bro had a really nice situ they had a really nice setup right sure no prio for Baron but they've got a Jackson side
5:03:59
let's roll the second highlight they've got a Jackson side so while this is happening Morgan has the ability to push
5:04:06
here bdd is kind of trapped between do I want to stop this push in mid cuz I have strong push there makes it really
5:04:11
difficult to actually start up Baron here for KT let's roll this forward and see hok really wants to try to deny
5:04:17
anyone from rotating over so they can actually continue to put the pressure onto that uh bottom inhibitor turret hok
5:04:23
here is alone charges his vault breaker because he's like this is a tough call should I Collapse on bdd with Morgan or
5:04:29
should we actually look for another prior Target like Duck are my teammates Too Far Away We Roll It Forward we'll see what he ultimately decides to do
5:04:36
here is to go back in on Duck misses the Vault breaker unfortunately finds himself isolated and dead now my biggest
5:04:43
issue with all this is not really hok's individual play here because there were a lot of tough calls to make but bro
5:04:48
could have just continued to group in mid he didn't need to flank he could have just backed away and let Morgan push and I think the idea there too was
5:04:55
okay maybe if I ult in Morgan get some extra time but they were just so hesitant in how they pulled this off and
5:05:00
then here instead of trying to push mid as well they try to group up with Morgan Morgan's whole game plan here is to get
5:05:06
the inhibitor right but you can also pull the KT players to defend and then they can continue that mid push get some
5:05:12
Vision on Baron they just kind of flubbed it here got super nervous and then altogether made a few wrong
5:05:17
decisions that ultimately allowed KT this free team fight win and the secure of the victory in game two as you
5:05:23
mentioned a lot of disconnection happened in this team especially uh when I had the failures in other team I also
5:05:30
had the issue that we had so many different iname leaders so we have so many ideas but we are not on the same
5:05:37
page and that kind of made our uh mistakes many times in many moments so I
5:05:42
feel like they just need to clear out who's going to do lead the game and who's going to shot call for the in-game
5:05:48
rotation yeah lots of learning lessons here for the Bros they finish the week 1 in one so do KT and with the end of the
5:05:54
week is time for our best ceremonies of week two of the lck cup we take a look
5:06:00
at some of our Victorious player celebrations y That's you call Signature pose yeah and uh you know he he plays
5:06:08
himself very well this one I would say that's you know showmaker let's see oh I I forgot who was he playing Tia
5:06:18
he was threading the looks like he was playing beer pong I don't know what was he doing it's a messy ceremony ah okay
5:06:26
okay okay all right lazy feel honestly it's very cute but also like he just
5:06:32
deserves a lot of credit for just playing very well you know what like he's so cute for lazy field like he want
5:06:37
to be like a bad guy you know that do the revolver thing and like so humble at the same time so you had to bow after he
5:06:43
panicked he panicked he kill once and bow after that you know it's that so humble and cute by the way well after
5:06:49
taking a look at all those uh different celebrations let us know in the chat who you think wins by flying the flag with
5:06:56
the emotes that you can get by subscribing here on the lck channel in the meantime let's take a look at the
5:07:02
standings with that Victory group Elder has taken control of the group battles
5:07:08
there is no way back for group Baron now it's a battle for the bottom of group Baron who's going to get knocked out
5:07:13
well the big question is yeah Will BN K win their final match it's against Nim
5:07:19
and also will dnf lose their match because they have to and they have to have the worst game score than bnk in
5:07:25
order for bnk to make it through as you can see here the losing group in this case Baron has that fifth place team
5:07:30
eliminated and the first to Fourth goes to plins against of course the fourth to fifth from group Elder top three will
5:07:37
just go directly to playoffs yeah only one team is out of the cup and they only
5:07:42
played five games it's kind of rough it's kind of rough but I think uh in this tournament we want to more uh uh
5:07:49
more random moments like this I think it's kind of more interesting and uh really excited to see about it yeah the
5:07:56
cup has brought a lot of those Great Moments a lot of changes substitution information gathering if you will for
5:08:02
some of the teams and now we only have five matches left with Lunar New Year
5:08:07
coming up it'll be Friday Saturday and Sunday it all kicks off with the DN freaks against KT roster hun life
5:08:14
Esports against DRX T1 and gen big one right there your guys' match of the week
5:08:19
with bro DK and bfx and nongin battling it out for those bottom spots it's the best day I mean it might be the best day
5:08:26
of the entire tournament bro versus DK is going to be cool because bro has historically upset this team especially
5:08:31
when they look like the The Underdogs especially when Daman in the past looked like they were Untouchable so I'm really looking forward to that one but of
5:08:37
course T1 geni yeah the names speak for themselves and also there is a high chance smash play against J and this
5:08:45
time around I think it's a kind of like final step to prove himself because he's playing against ji and also especially
5:08:52
he's playing against roua uh the the ad carry you know so I feel like this match
5:08:57
will decide who is going to play the rest of the uh cup or the the split so I
5:09:02
think it will be a banger serious for sure and again the freaks bro and bfx all battling for the bottom spot over in
5:09:09
group Baron and if you need your fix for more green League Legends we got you covered here with Challengers week three
5:09:16
