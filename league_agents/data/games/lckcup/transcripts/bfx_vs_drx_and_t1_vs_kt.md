31:34
we are [Music]
31:50
exped welcome ladies and gentlemen to the lck cup 2025 I'm Atlas I'm joined by
31:56
wolf as we get ready for today's matches there is a looming Telecom War we do
32:02
have to talk about that but first we need to get in to our initial matchup and this one is a little bit different B
32:08
andk going to be taking on DRX in our Opening match and uh yeah somehow b k
32:15
the only team without a victory we thought that was going to be bro as well until yesterday happened and they two Z
32:21
gen G out of nowhere yeah we did see bro take the upset win yesterday uh we'll see if today bfx or bnk that is to say
32:29
can actually take that win it's so important for them cuz when we look at the standings you'll see as you
32:34
mentioned winless and right now it's looking like group Baron is going to be the losing group so if that's the case
32:41
the fifth place team is eliminated doesn't get that opportunity for play-ins for DRX a win here would put
32:47
them at three and one which is amazing for their standings in the winning group as well so this is a huge game for both
32:53
teams right now and for BN K you really need to win this one the opposition that
32:59
you're up against here at DX it's definitely a winnable game you brought jingi to the brink in game one you were
33:04
narrowly defeated by D+ it's definitely a winnable Series this one is so important if you lose this one you're
33:10
all but guaranteed to get knocked out yeah and uh it's starting to make me think that perhaps T1 choosing b k as
33:17
their option when it was their turn in like the sort of drafting that was happening maybe it was Sinister because
33:23
if bnk do prove to be the weakest team that we have here thus far
33:28
then maybe it was to make sure that they had a scapegoat if their group was to lose smart play potentially I mean it's
33:35
it's smart but there is some Sinister Linings there and I guarantee it's not actually what they were thinking going
33:41
into it but it is fun to sort of ruminate on it is I think Rio has definitely pinpointed the issue we've
33:46
all seen is that this team has had a lack of a clear voice uh when we're
33:51
we're seeing team fights break out we're setting up for objectives the loss to geni is a real big stain on their 20 25
33:58
so far because they had that game completely won I mean it was basically an unable game but they just couldn't
34:04
make the right calls at the right time and a team like geni will punish you and even though Teddy still isn't uh ready
34:11
to play yet he's still unfortunately a little bit under the weather uh lazy field has been able to to make some big
34:16
plays and that's often despite losing Lane being down on CS so very impressive
34:21
start to the Vietnamese players career yeah I would agree I I think that his he a breath breath of fresh air as well
34:27
with his play style right because like you're saying it's not about like Immaculate laning phase getting all of the money and playing that kind of game
34:34
it's about winning the fights and the skirmishes understanding your capabilities what you can get done in
34:39
these uh early to mid game fights that he has been excelling in so it's really really fun stuff via versus uh ucal here
34:46
as well which is kind of interesting because they're both returning to the lck but definitely after very different
34:52
careers right yeah ukel uh being called Korea's greatest sword cuz of the Tire
34:58
in his name uh in Korean is is basically knife or like a blade so that's where that comes from it's not the word for
35:04
sword necessarily but it's not a reference it's not a reference to the 2018 summer final as well where it beat
35:10
sword in a best of Five series it went to five games one of the most epic series of all time where score won his
35:15
first LSK title it wasn't a reference to that it's a bit sad that it wasn't because it's kind of cool um but also
35:20
sword isn't here uh and hasn't been here for a while so uh maybe not relevant let's uh welcome the players to lar I
35:27
like the uh bnk jerseys by the way the new ones they're pretty minimalist but I think they're pretty clear you know I I
35:33
sometimes I think jerseys try too hard they go a little bit to um off the rails and this is very clean the new DRX
35:39
jackets as well looking pretty nice here it feels like we're really kind of getting into 2025 you know we're
35:45
starting to get get used to these teams we know these rosters now I'm not saying we're experts by any means halfway
35:51
through week 2 here not even halfway but it it feels like you know now it's no longer a mystery now we know what teams
35:57
clear strings some weaknesses are yeah I would agree and I do think that like because these jerseys look a little bit
36:03
like the old quondong freaks um jerseys used to so I feel like The quondong Vibes are being kept alive even though
36:09
it's the DN freaks now uh over there so kind of cool and definitely suits like I
36:15
I'm I'm into it I'm definitely into it uh DRX let's see what they're going to be able to put down because somehow this
36:21
team is like 50% win rate here in the lck cup and I think a lot of us really
36:28
had them pretty low as far as our standings were concerned they haven't been winning a whole lot of games I
36:33
think there's definitely some issues that we can see forming um this guy on screen has had some great performances
36:41
and some really really not like opposite of great I feel like to me for for DRX
36:47
the main thing is they know how to be clutch you know when it comes to to really important team fights they will
36:54
punish you they will find the angle even down on gold off times even in those Scrappy types of games but when their
37:00
drafts fall flat on their face they just don't have the tools to be clutch and I think that for me has been the biggest
37:07
up or down for DRX they've had games where they've had a standard draft we've seen lazy field down on gold clutch it
37:13
out we've seen rich with some nice engag as sponge has looked good on those Baron fights but it's when the the draft just
37:19
puts you at such a deficit picking corki first B1 and going into gumas Caitlyn where you're just you're playing the
37:25
game with your hands tied behind your back this roster just just can't get it done so for me one of the biggest things for DRX to focus on is that drafting I
37:32
think some of it has been because lazy Fields champion pool is a little bit smaller here at the lck compared to some of our greats um that they've given him
37:39
that opportunity to play corki for example but there are still ways to blend his champion pool into a good
37:45
draft and I think they're starting to figure that out on the other side I mean lazy feel versus Diablo two incredibly
37:51
aggressive players just like hype you know all three of these newer Challenger players coming into the lck are high
37:56
risk High reward um so I imagine we'll have some really fun team fights in this one yeah and
38:02
definitely a lot of that youthful exuberance with just how young both of these players on the bottom side are
38:08
thankfully Dia does have Kell there to give him a bit of that veteran voice but as Ryu said like we're going back to
38:14
more of the same problems that every Kell team has and that is where is our unifying voice in these team fights to
38:21
get us doing the right thing I think andle I mean he definitely was out of the fry pan into the fire when it came
38:27
into learning to shock call and things like that I think a lot of us saw what CV Max was trying to instill into the
38:33
man last year and we're glad that he doesn't have to deal with that anymore um so like I think that andle's there I
38:40
just don't think Kellen ever will be right because people have been trying for so many years he's just not that guy
38:46
and so who is it going to be is it going to be raptor is it going to be clear a Top Lane is not going to do it because they're basically in a different game
38:52
the entirety of the time like rap it has to be on Raptor I think if there is going to be be a shule that forms on
38:58
this team I agree Raptor via the mid jungle Synergy needs to be strong and so
39:04
far it's looked like one of the stronger points of this team they've had some really strong early games obviously that
39:10
game against gingi comes to mind let's see what they draft for here on red side as DRX does have side selection they
39:16
will pick blue and interes seeting Zyra ban first that's really interesting to see the kalista is no surprise the Aur
39:24
red kalista on red side is sorry on blue side is kind of crazy it is pretty crazy cuz it gives them a free gante ban here
39:29
which has been one of the most common b1s in game one of a series and now they
39:34
could still ban the Aurora if that's a concern they have here so Rumble going to be uh leaving and I think that like
39:41
first pick Jace is feeling like an option here Rich has definitely been uh
39:46
gravitating to that pick recently he has the vi and the Aurora I think are the two big ones in this final spot here
39:53
that you really have to consider you got the gante ban you didn't have B kalista
39:58
opt for the vi we'll see if UK wants to pick up that Aurora first here now corki
40:04
is up I do I suggest they do not take it yeah I mean so both lazy feeli and dible
40:09
have played corki twice I mean actually no it's vicker vicker's played Cori twice the teams have played Cori twice
40:16
we're just hoping that they've learned from those two mistakes and they're just not going to do it and Bessa being HED
40:21
here is a fun one for Rich still going to be a bit of a flex as well UK could be piloting that in the mid lane although we have haven't seen as much
40:28
success for ambessa Mid as we have seen elsewhere that's true it was fer that was playing it he did actually have some
40:34
pretty amazing team fights uh some of those moments were pretty nice but outside of that it was not so good but
40:40
that's going to be the first lock in and Dia going straight to Ezreal that's a lot of comfort for him he does like this
40:46
pick but doesn't feel like the highest priority 8 carry well the kalista is
40:52
gone but there are still really strong picks available into this now Lane swap does allow you to avoid some of that but
40:58
eventually you will have to uh pay the piper you will have to show up to those team fights you will have to face a vars or an ash later on and you are going to
41:05
be fairly weak at level one trying to set up that lane swap with this but this is a strong Duo I mean scholastically
41:11
when you just those two Champions and isolation Okay cool you got a strong bot Duo very safe as well the question is
41:18
how is this going to be punished I think it's great in the ambessa as well is fairly easy to position yourself to
41:24
avoid getting hit by that kaisa another option of a chance that does well into the Ezreal
41:29
individually yeah so Kaiser and real just going to be the choices here so we've got bottom Lanes being locked in
41:35
it feels like a bit of an agreement here like a pivot that they've gone with on the side of DRX like seeing this
41:41
immediate lock in of the bottom Lane they just say all right I guess we'll lock in ours and we're feeling pretty good about it thought we might see a
41:47
varus there cuz lazy feels super good at that pick it's one of his best but he's very good at Kaiser as well though and with the matchup being kind of okay then
41:54
I'm feeling pretty uh pretty good about this especially pair with the real he also doesn't play that much much
41:59
Misfortune so now they've taken the ra away so that combo is something that they don't necessarily have to worry about later on as much Jack's going to
42:06
get locked in here for Clear pretty early into the ambessa so now we kind of
42:11
have bot top locked up it's the mid jungle that becomes a little bit more interesting moving into the second ban
42:16
phase and thei is taken away the Zyra is taken away scarner is taken away every
42:21
game so it's hardly need mentioning but wonder where we go here I mean if you're worried about playing the ambessa mid AP
42:29
junglers are kind of what you're thinking about here the Lilia is taken away we could see a n ban as well if
42:34
they really think that Flex is going to come through yep sponge as well has played a bit of brand and stuff like this I think that he does have pretty
42:41
Deep Pockets when it comes to the AP choices does mean that UK can then play something like a y which is uh kind of
42:47
what they're worried about I would imagine Sani the obvious one just with that perer Synergy alongside the Jack
42:52
going to be a very scary thing to deal with on the top side of the map for that 2v2 yeah shinha is another
42:58
that defitely needs a look Victor will be taken away from UK one of his iconics who's already played it this season and
43:04
that is taken away really works well with the rest of their composition too uh because they have a really good front
43:10
line with the ambessa and the real together it's not a dive oriented Champion that kaisa often likes to play
43:15
with but I do think the ban makes sense yeah and I mean if you wanted to B
43:20
shinou here it's fairly safe I think this Z's a really good option I think just get rid of it it's being uh so
43:26
powerful but instead it's going to be the pigeon so Vick's bird not going to be on the rift this time around would
43:33
give them like a pretty absurd team fight yeah it's crazy with the uh Leona
43:38
set up with Jack and then the damage output to break through those tanks and the sideling power wukong's fun does
43:44
feel like a very Raptor pick as well oh yeah that NY I mentioned that they didn't ban is hovered here and Rich can
43:52
just offed into playing the ambessa mid I mean yeah so yuk could play and then we could put like we could have the nly
43:59
Renekton combo but I don't know whether sponge has his license yet um we'll just
44:05
have to see how it goes has he play he hovered it once before yeah he has played it rich gets to play his Jace so
44:12
I guess that's where we're going hang on wait so sponge is like he hasn't died on
44:17
N he had a phenomenal game last time around so I guess maybe we just give it to him I think it's going to be a pretty
44:24
tricky uh game to play out though unless you know know they they end up winning Lanes early and we'll see what happens
44:29
with the swap um because I assume that Diablo is not going to be opting into laning into the kaisel early on it's not
44:36
the it's not an unplayable match up by any means but it is tougher so n thrives
44:42
when you have a lot of Lane control and it looks like UK May in fact actually be playing the jce mid cuz even though Rich
44:48
has liked to play it you mentioned how that could have been a first pick angle for them um it makes sense in mid especially with the Tia lock in so you
44:55
hold that flexibility here as DX Jace goes mid play the ambass into the Jack top side you feel pretty safe um because
45:03
you banned the Sani away right Wukong isn't going to be that powerful at ganking pre6 he can make an impact but
45:09
you don't feel like if you are going to go for a lane swap here that you know you're going to get totally boomed um by
45:16
this situation and I think it'll likely be instead BN K that opts into that with the Ezreal we'll have to wait and see
45:23
this draft here I think for both sides feels pretty solid and that's relieving to me because we've had so many series
45:29
here at cup where you're like you walk into the game going I think I already know the result and this is not that no
45:35
but there I think there are like very clear archetypal differences which I really like right you've got like the unab Bunga of uh the bnk BX composition
45:44
and then you got more of a thinking man's poke pokey Sid Lane type draft that uh DRX have put together and we'll
45:50
just have to see whether they can actually make that one work right because they do have the Wild Card who
45:55
has a suicide button right like we saw yesterday that if you put Kaiser in the
46:00
hands of a young player things can go wrong but then they can go ever so right
46:05
as hype proved on uh Brion yesterday I hope that lazy field does have some fun
46:11
things to show us on this Kaiser and I hope that bnk have a much better performance here up against DRX let's
46:16
jump on the rift for game one
46:31
all right here we are ladies and gentlemen onto the rift and I do want to clarify something again that I think we're probably going to have to do like
46:37
every single day we are saying BN K yes um bfx is the triode that's used in the
46:43
game and it stands for bnk FX but we just don't say that Tri code when we're
46:49
talking about the team and I know that and I do it by accident sometimes yeah we all do it by accident sometimes because it's right there on the screen I
46:55
have a habit of reading stuff which is a big problem uh when we're not supposed to say the thing that is on the screen
47:01
so you have to bear with us I know it's a bit confusing but that's just how it is yeah now we can talk more about that
47:07
later but I do want to mention lazy feel and andil predict the lane swap but actually bfx or see I did it again
47:14
that's two that's two out of the three I told I told myself I get three I'm fired um so here we go uh wow we have right on
47:20
the edge um but yeah right in the beginning of game one but they they are actually going to be able to see clear here Ezreal goes bottom Lane they don't
47:27
know where rich is right now cuz he's under turret but going to get the reveal here as clear finds out um but this is
47:34
smart from bnk they played the level one well and they're still able to avoid the
47:39
kaisa lazy field really wanted to match that lane Swap and will be unsuccessful yep and of course like I think that uh
47:45
DRX is kind of okay with this as well uh because like the early early levels the Kaiser isn't quite uh as powerful as she
47:52
can be as far as like just being able to execute um an Ezreal composition in the latest stages and so rich he's going to
48:00
be struggling and clear as well is just going to try and get as much experience as he can as Andel takes a turret shot
48:06
wor 100% wanting to get rid of uh some of the experienc opportunities here from Clear of course a little bit more
48:12
difficult to do this year than it was last time around but still so for n Alice there's two things you know we
48:18
talked about how Spong had a pretty good hold up speaking up speaking of sponge he is going to make his way in misses an almost Point Blank spear but it does not
48:24
matter that is still First Blood and all right I reckon like well I if he
48:30
didn't have his license after the last game I'm giving it to him now this man's NY knows what to do get stuff done as
48:36
quickly as you can I think there were some Wards very near the path that sponge took but he was able to avoid
48:43
them so I think that's why vicka was looking a little bit confused there on the player Cam and a little bit frustrated with how that all played out
48:49
um and I was going to say the two things about n for me are do you have winning lanes and do you have setup CC they
48:56
don't really have great CC for the M yeah the setup is really not there outside but if you're overextended in
49:03
your lane and uh I mean jce technically has CC but if you're overextended you are going to get
49:09
punished and Oopsy Daisy there speaking of punish let's see how many dashes Rich
49:15
has and it turns out with a flash included it's kind of three and he's well and truly out of there but still
49:21
Plate's going to go over and that is a Summoner spell lost here for the DRX bottom laner or top laner or wherever he
49:26
is now now yeah what do we want to call it I mean I guess we're calling it a bottom laner cuz he is a bottom laner he is in the bottom Lane at the moment um
49:33
is it location based or is it roll based you know I kind of like to think it's roll based but I'll let you do top or
49:40
bottom Lane this time for our top laner I mean we say bot now instead of marksman if it was Marksman it would make way more sense but we say bot
49:46
instead as dible really wants to go home and andle really doesn't want him to go home uh he's going to be successful thus
49:52
far but I think that uh Diablo will eventually uh be allowed to leave they got Rich's flash um and that's
50:00
decent value as uh take a look at this one again so he has that more than the banana brush that's that CT you were
50:06
talking about yeah so it's not really like the setup um that that n is really looking for she kind of wants people to
50:11
be locked in place but it's the stopping them thing uh that is pretty important but in this case pushing them further
50:17
away from safety gives n the chance to do a little bit more damage so it still works in the end uh Rich flashing there
50:25
on the bottom Lane I was scared of a flash play by Kell and didn't want to have to risk it but probably could have
50:31
held the flash there until the zenth played but either way just wants to make sure he's alive and um he likely wasn't
50:37
alive if he got caught by anything so ultimately would have had to flash either way probably so I won't criticize him too much for that but he is down now
50:44
that Summoner otherwise though a great start here for DRX you can see n naturally out farming the Wukong that's
50:50
just how that match up goes has that extra kill too so has an early burn earn
50:56
so that's going to help help Farm as well I really like you know picking up the uh the very early ring as well
51:02
making sure that if those Stacks do happen to uh start building up it's uh
51:07
it's going to be a good time here for DRX The Snowball Effect could certainly be dangerous as zukal able to farm very
51:14
comfortably on this Jace in the mid lane with that extra setup from that first Blood going over very very good stuff so
51:20
like you say DRX sitting pretty right now and Rich handled the lane swap a little bit better as a significant uh
51:26
advantage in terms of farm right now so that's going well for them ultimately diao now still laning into lazy F here
51:32
in the top side as we do swap back doesn't look like rich is going to miss too much from that wave that's crashing down in the bottom side doesn't have to
51:38
use his teleport so he can actually show up to the grub fight um if he needs to clear is walking up now cuz he did have
51:45
that push advantage and this is a really important and pivotal moment here for bnk see if they can link some CC
51:52
together here yeah they take coming over sponge able to take the first one away and even connects the spear there on
51:58
Raptor actually wasn't expecting that one to land because there was so many things in the way now can sponge get another little uh
52:06
cheeky steel looks like the answer is going to be no because Raptor still has smip and now Kell could be in trouble has to flash out of the way of The Spar
52:12
sponge can't make up his mind but it looks like DRX do have this kill locked down for themselves although Kell just
52:18
does the walk strategy and he's going to be fine sponge on the other hand not so much about 300 health here as uh BK do
52:25
make their way out feels like a victory for for BK because they were able to get the two grubs but a few extra Summoner
52:32
spells I guess going down not really actually yeah only only uh Kellen having
52:37
to use his yeah and so that's and that's a hex flash so that's like it's basically not a l I actually really like
52:43
how bnk set that fight up because what they were trying to do is collapse with B's ult with Kell having that flank
52:49
engage angle and if they're able to lock down a single Target not only do they get those two grubs but they probably
52:54
win the fight they were unsuccessful but they still were able to opt out and get out with the two grubs only expending
53:00
Leona flash so actually kind of a big win for them yeah now BK looking to grab
53:06
the first dragon as well so most of the grubs and the first Drake that feels pretty nice especially when it is that
53:12
hex tech Cloud going to be next on the menu so no Cloud Souls but still some uh pretty Spicy Dragon options for some
53:19
souls and that could be a win condition here for BN K they're able to continue this game going and I do think that as
53:24
far as longevity is concerned like this composition Works a whole lot better now that level sixes have been hit now that
53:31
we've got Cyclones and waver walls and ways to to really make these team fights work in their favor cuz that's where
53:38
they want to be winning I think DRX want to be winning every other way right
53:43
absolutely agree rich not winning in this way uh he's trying to dash his way out of there
53:49
as clear is just going to flash forward and doesn't manage to kill him he's going to need an extra couple of buttons
53:54
but they trade flashes and that is Rich having to get out of the lane nicely done there by Clea rich is going to be
54:00
able to get this honey fruit though so I don't think he's going to lose that XP or the uh gold from that wave that's coming through so ultimately just ends
54:07
up being a trade of flash Rich probably feels pretty okay with that considering he was able to get out with his life there see the um Farm here is still
54:14
significant uh of a lead for rich but it's not like Game ending or anything like that as uh this has been one of
54:22
lazy Field's uh better laning phases obviously has the advantage in this and did play through a lane swap where he
54:28
was hitting a jack so you know he is supposed to be coming out of this one feeling pretty good but so far he has
54:35
and it's been a really quiet early game outside of that gank that we had early on but I would give right now kind of
54:41
the edge to B and K like you said because they got that Dragon wi con stacking up and they do end up having a
54:47
composition that scales incredibly well later on they got through the toughest part of their draft just have questions about where uh Clear goes from here cuz
54:55
he's not in the spot on the Shacks not accelerated at all do have the two grubs which will help him in the Sid Lane
55:00
later on especially if they can get a few more of the second set in about 70 seconds time Diablo is as real so The
55:06
Observers are concerned for him but I'm really not yeah he's just going to be putting on some extra pressure that Kell
55:12
is making his way back as UK takes a little bit of a ride here on a seismic shove but in fact the trade is kind of
55:17
fine with the assistance of the turret sponge looking to come on over and do the same thing again whether that's going to be quite as
55:24
successful as it is just mid lane is trading bom we had the gold come up for
55:30
every lane basically being you know DRX is winning everywhere and that's true especially in the jungle where First
55:36
Blood Stacks up half of that gold lead and then he out Farms the Wukong but what Raptor can do in team fights is
55:41
often a lot more than what sponge can do unless he lands some initial poke so that's a a factor that isn't going to
55:47
show up in that 800 gold Advantage so we'll have to really see what happens in this first big team fight which will
55:52
likely be on these grubs here because DRX do not want to give a Jax you four or five grubs if they can help it so
55:58
they are going to commit to this fight you have to imagine Rich does not have teleport so we have to walk up Viet does so he can catch this wave and then join
56:05
the fight and I think we're going to see fireworks here love the position of andil here looking for a potential setup
56:10
pick here before the fight breaks out also will have access back to the pit cuz he is well y so much Vision as well
56:16
available here so I think that uh b k is going to have to give this one up looks like it raptor is going to come in
56:22
clears out that control Ward as at least the first one of the grubs is going to be taken here here by DRX andle getting
56:28
some Vision up and available for himself as rich with his teleport up and available okay UK is just getting a bit
56:35
of the clear treatment as Primal surge comes in to keep him alive teleport comes up towards that top
56:42
side as well that is one grub a piece out of these as W via comes over that should be the confirmation as never mind
56:48
that is a max range spear to even out the grub take and everyone is out of here you got a warrior tricker to get
56:54
Raptor out teleport's coming forward we are committing to trying to do something I just don't know whether it's going to
57:00
be enough as Raptor and Kellen a little bit dangerous here towards his top side as that shock blast is a lot of value
57:06
just not a lot of value that's going to be um utilized at this point in time lazy field trying to grab himself a plate and
57:13
ultimately wolf like it's just an evening out of the grubs not really a whole lot else this game is not the most
57:20
exciting in terms of kills but in terms of some of the positional steps we're seeing for both of these teams you can already see how much they've improved
57:26
from week one as well as I feel like how teams have started to realize that you don't have to all in on every fight no
57:32
matter what if you don't actually have the the setup or a proper wion for said fight and uh good disengage there again
57:39
from bnk should have walked away with four but good steal from sponge there with a spear and he'll try to walk as
57:46
confusingly as possible and it's working here as that Mystic shot does go wide getting a fair bit of information not
57:52
going to be able to take this uh this crab but maybe the banana Ward is going to be enough tell you what though clear
57:58
has been pretty scary and uh that could uh certainly be something that uh bnk
58:04
can lean on later into the game we were talking about DRX being able to utilize s side Lanes as a one condition with
58:09
Jace and with ambessa but I mean Jax is the guy as rich is going to throw his ultimate away gives uh clear the good
58:15
old thumbs up may have lured him into a false sense of security or maybe it's just not false maybe you should have a
58:21
sense of security because everything kind of just going all right public execution is the new chance of corrupt
58:26
in this tournament can't hit that ability nobody can our top top lers have been able to
58:32
hit it but you know some of the the other ones have not been so Lu oh I love that oh the ignite Interruption
58:39
beautiful that's going to guarantee a dragon here for DRX that's going to even out their feat of strength I guess far
58:46
as that objective is concerned let's see what soul we get here pretty curious about it cuz these compositions will
58:51
what going to be I'm kind of feeling infernal off of this it's the opposite infernal as now clear is just going to
58:59
take it easy here on this bottom side rich without his first item completed just yet of course Eclipse feels really
59:05
nice look together ocean pretty good for both teams uh you know no big super
59:10
tanky boys uh on either team obviously the re um and the Essa are pretty tanky
59:15
Leona obviously Jax can kind of be pseudo tanky like an evasion tank but um
59:21
y you know these fights can go longer obviously not ideally for Dr if that is
59:27
going to be how fight plays out because they kind of want to burst somebody down and if that person gets away with ocean soul and heals back up that's a big
59:33
problem for them yep I mean ultimately it feels like DRX want to not even really fight right it wants to be smoke
59:39
and mirrors yeah for this team uh because like you say like there are circles there's AOE CC there's all sorts
59:46
of things here for B K and diao is going to be really tough to lock down so if they can just find people catch them on
59:53
awes and then play this Sid Lane game that could work work out here as andle he's learned that one as the shattering
59:59
strike is going to get a flash he'll take that trade any day of the week yeah TOA without Flash is not going to be
1:00:04
feeling good for a potential follow-up gang um oh SP man diao really walked
1:00:10
around that spear as it was coming out we get the zoom in though as oh my goodness Arcane shift coming out making
1:00:17
that one work for him as trop Rush does a fair bit of damage here to Lazy feel that red buff on the Diablo almost
1:00:22
spelled his demise man that was crazy uh how how narrowly he escaped there
1:00:28
without having to use his Flash oh this is sneaky andle has the Intel as void Seeker is his own one so
1:00:36
he's still lying in weight it's funny to watch this fight happen when there's no objective up but I think the the real
1:00:42
objective that DRX are looking for is this top tur they already got VI flash they want to follow up so b b andk here
1:00:47
have to opt into like grouping up around top side making sure he doesn't get Dove now you can see he has to back he's he's
1:00:54
uncomfortable about the situation does get out of there and that's going to be a wave crashing through he could TP back but that's also
1:00:59
risky Kell has to kind of escort him back to the Top Lane they don't have a lot of vision the vision game here for DRX has been phenomenal uh Andel in
1:01:06
particular has been doing a great job especially on the top side of the map really controlling Vision there just hasn't really been an answer for b k
1:01:13
just yet and there's that eclip Shield that we were talking about of course clear if he does manage to land a few of
1:01:19
these in Powers things are looking good is there he goes denies a cannon there as well as andel's going to come through
1:01:24
that time the public executions going to land and clear does he have enough of a Counter Strike that's the question he's
1:01:30
burning burning burning but it's not going to be enough I think he ate a cookie there to make sure he stayed
1:01:36
alive and it worked out beautifully solar flare goes entirely wide as sponge is turning up to protect his midlaner
1:01:44
Kellen is actually going to take a big ride is now sponge able to help lazy field grab a kill before going down as
1:01:50
now UK coming on over to help with this one that dive was a mistake and DRX
1:01:56
punish yeah that was a huge punish there from DRX so the wave was cleared out early and so much damage taken from Kell
1:02:02
and the collapse was super easy to play out there sponge does go down but they trade it back beautifully you know clear
1:02:09
survives because they do not they tried to give the kill over to the ambessa but
1:02:15
over here things are just kind of gifted as B andk were already so heavily indexed into playing around top side to
1:02:20
kind of make sure that viub was safe and then they decide to dive here after the ja escapes but
1:02:26
yeah just way too deep unfortunately laser field has the shield from his ultimate has cleanse as well I mean this
1:02:32
is really UK helping to set this up as well the wave is super thinned out and you can see he goes in pushes the Ezreal
1:02:39
away and now he's like all right well they're still fighting down here there still opted in sh blast connects and then he just goes to the skies and takes
1:02:45
a second Big Win here two kills the really clean Jay playing and Dia's dead
1:02:52
Dia's dead that didn't look um like it I don't we'll have to wait and see and clear is now in a whole host of trouble
1:02:58
because there is a Jace coming in Rich might die uh before he gets here as granders might helping him out but uh
1:03:04
UK's running real quick and he's just getting thrown around there to the skies as you said so eloquently before he does
1:03:11
that again and that's another like dead player on the side of bnk they will get
1:03:16
the turret here but DRX have already gotten the first one so maybe DRX are
1:03:22
just a really good team wolf I don't know what is happening to our team that had just been losing before I know this
1:03:27
is against BN K but DX looking real fine in this game in this case he didn't know so he he Arcane shifted he had his Leona
1:03:35
nearby so he felt pretty safe this is just a deep Ward again incredible Vision setup and warding by DRX this game their
1:03:42
map plays have been just really good and they're allowed to make these moves because of the ward setups they have and
1:03:48
clear just doesn't have any idea gets punished here and it feels like now DRX is running circles around a bnk that you
1:03:55
know you mentioned we've been talking about it hasn't had a very consistent voice yep and the setups just aren't
1:04:02
quite there as cleanly as what DRX have been doing of course they haven't had a lot of pressure on them right so there's
1:04:07
not a lot that's stopping Andel from just orchestrating you know their Vision layouts as he sees fit and that's
1:04:15
something I think bnk need to be looking out for uh as this year goes on right there is a lot of growth opportunity uh
1:04:21
here for these players a lot of them very very young and also haven't been playing together for all that long long uh DRX also with a lot of information
1:04:28
about clear as of course he was their star Challenger player uh him and sponge have played together in the past you
1:04:34
know there is information available all over the place and in fact there's a lot of like Challenger alumni that are now
1:04:41
playing together on completely different teams right with Dia here Andel coming up as well um a little bit before lazy
1:04:47
Fields time unfortunately for him but certainly does feel like a bit of a return to some of our Challenger games
1:04:53
from maybe like a year or two ago now earlier I was saying you know we'd have to wait and see how the team fights
1:04:59
play out and that's still true cuz we haven't really had a standard team fight
1:05:04
because B and K were able to you know sneak those grub scenarios into their favor and then kind of off out of fights
1:05:09
but see what they can do with the UK here yeah seismic shove is going to connect solar flare this time is going to work out as UK may take one with him
1:05:16
as yeah Kell's really dead decent magnet storm is going to help take that one down it's andil he'll claim the kill bnk
1:05:22
will be able to make it work though by being able to pick up the turret tra one for one it's not the end of the world but they'll give away shell and DRX are
1:05:30
going to look to push even further on this top side as clear he is Jack you know pretty good at dealing with the
1:05:35
dive but as soon as that counter strike's down it's going to be a tough time and lazy field man he's really starting to do some damage with those
1:05:40
two items he's already put together yeah now VI is going to get some damage done to this turret here but you trade one
1:05:46
for one on the bottom side push the Jacks out get a turret here it's not really a big enough win here for bnk or
1:05:52
really a win at all know cuz they lost the out of tet and the and the rift so it's it's one for one and and I I was
1:06:00
going to say like I still think there's real strong team fighting here for BN K and I was saying I thought they were
1:06:05
ahead even though they were about 1,000 gold behind earlier because the team fighting Power was there but they've just been picked apart on the map so
1:06:12
surgically that we just don't get to have that conversation about team fights until they can win one to get that gold back to where it should be cuz right now
1:06:18
3,000 gold behind it just feels unplayable yeah and uh the some of the reasons why we were saying that team
1:06:23
fight is so strong is because Cyclone exists but I don't know whether it does I haven't really seen one so far today
1:06:29
and so Raptor's really going to have to make his presence actually known in this game the Wukong can be so powerful that
1:06:35
it has to be employed you know uh in order to get that one to happen so right now camping out in this brush over here
1:06:42
and DRX haven't given them a lot of opportunities to be fair right uh but this voracious arakan could do it as now
1:06:49
Raptor comes in is going to be able to get a flash out from lazy field and now Raptor taking some damage here from as
1:06:55
well the cycl we will see but it's used defensively not really what you want especially when there's such a big buff
1:07:01
up and available W's wall also tossed in and You Know Rich missed his ult because
1:07:07
diao flashed it so now the Ezreal is down flash so everything here is a win for DRX they have so much vision control
1:07:13
again around this pit like their warning has so good because lazy Fields got that
1:07:18
rage blade fully stacked up it's below half Health already Kell told to leave given that bad news is now handle he's
1:07:25
going to flash forward the Killer Instinct is named correctly here for lazy feel as vicka he flashes to get
1:07:31
himself out of the way and this Aon has not released just yet I don't know
1:07:36
whether they're going to take the chance especially with raptor in the area via does have teleport and they're
1:07:41
definitely aware of that he going to teleport back in with full health clear's in a dangerous position yeah and
1:07:46
sponge has a lot of Mobility leap strike used to get him back to his teammates but they're now kind of fish in a barrel
1:07:52
right they've got shock blast they've got Spears they got void Seekers the Poke from DRX is so dangerous if they
1:07:58
don't engage they will just lose as now sponge is going to drive a rift t for
1:08:03
some reason crashes it straight into a wall so that was obviously a bit of a mistake it's fine thought it was kind of
1:08:08
fun sort of the idea but now shell is just going to March past them and all
1:08:13
Dia is going to get tagged there as K taking so much damage UK will just kill him sponge over the wall there as well
1:08:19
no safe place for this Leona to go and Raptor took most of his health bar uh in
1:08:25
entally from what I kind of saw you know B and K were able to kind of opt out of
1:08:31
two risky fights on both grubs here in this first game but they weren't willing to do the same about this oton but they
1:08:37
were so low on health sure they stopped the oton they were able to get it a reset but they took so much damage and doing so they were never going to the followup fight and then Kell going in
1:08:44
there at the end of that one was a little bit puzzling I suppose he just wanted to make sure Viet could get out
1:08:49
uh I guess but ultimately we just kind of sacrifice himself they'll still end up losing the Aon so watch this again
1:08:55
look at where Kell is here and where the rest of his team is getting zoned VI here could set up some chain CC with him
1:09:00
but it's a Jace that's super fed in this game and vi just if he collapses and commits in he'll just get crushed by the
1:09:07
rest of DRX who already have pryo there so he just has to walk out and Kell's just left alone to die and he's not
1:09:13
allowed to be up that far right the rest of his team they couldn't walk through there was just too much that they'd have to deal with and with Rich standing in
1:09:20
the way diao cannot offer any follow-up damage and they're completely out ranged in those scenario I DRX just really
1:09:27
navigating what they need to do in these skirmishes so so well and they're making
1:09:33
this more poke composition than anything else work very very well well they played the the early game and they were
1:09:39
able to get so many picks so well and in the backfire of the play top side into UK for example just gave them such a
1:09:45
gold lead that the Poke composition is hitting harder than it's supposed to right now and it just makes it so
1:09:51
difficult for bnk yeah this game is all but over I mean now this point because now you've got auton buff you can push
1:09:57
out this inner turret super easily you're already winning sides before and win it even harder now Baron spawns in
1:10:02
45 seconds they going have so much vision for that rich may be in Rich may die as public execution is going to be
1:10:09
put on cool down uh for fun as UK is going to be able to take an inner turret for it remember that is just the Aon
1:10:15
buff remove so rich not too worried about it complet his second item yes I almost have tears of joy to watch DX go
1:10:21
we have Aon why don't we just 131 set up a side lane and then oh if somebody gets collapsed on guess what they reset we
1:10:28
get value in all three lanes finally we're doing it it's happening we're not just diving mid we don't have to just
1:10:33
throw the the the wings away keep we expecting to learn it in this series
1:10:38
though T-Rex is just so smart today this is actually just a really beautifully played like poke and Sid Lane
1:10:45
composition you know the smoke and mirrors is that's not that's just engaged from andil Kellen is going to be
1:10:52
able to zeni Blade but it's a double kill for lazy feel and I feel like he's putting in the work he's named
1:10:57
incorrectly in this particular game because this guy is doing heavy lifting in these fights and they know when to
1:11:03
poke when to like hold them at arms length and when to just go in and it's andle making all of these decisions and
1:11:10
man to me you know he's only half KP well we may have to hold our thoughts on this for a moment cuz we are going to
1:11:15
have a contest here by bnk yeah TR barage comes in as handle that was an interesting maneuver but I liked it I
1:11:21
think it was just a hex flash having a bit of fun there as very low health bars here on DRX there's the steal from
1:11:26
raptor oh no he still has a Smite button that Cyclone also getting so much value remember arakan I think is still here no
1:11:33
it's just worn off as clear not going to be able to survive Dia playing that one out very well UK there with an auto
1:11:39
attack though so is going to be able to take him down Baron on the rift though for BN K and maybe this is where the
1:11:47
House of Cards starts to fall down I mean you know this is the power of of what Wukong could do in a baron pit get
1:11:54
over the wall Cyclone is going to be a really disruptive tool he steals the baron and allows his team to team fight
1:12:00
afterwards coming back to this play here though this is the measured aggression you want to see you don't have to force
1:12:05
it but when you have an opportunity to play around vision and Andel sees the angle going and andil to me has been the
1:12:10
clear MVP of this first game I think everyone's going to be looking at UK's kill score his great defense of the top side but his vision game his control of
1:12:17
this Baron pit all game long has been insane he wants to keep Raptor out they have trap set here as well and raptor is
1:12:23
just like n I'm going to skirt my around clones in and Steals and then goes in for the follow-up Cyclone play here with
1:12:30
a sliver of Health hits a massive second one there is actually able to help trade his team back the win orill almost
1:12:37
making that one work but uh diabl out plays it now this is not a turnaround in
1:12:43
this game but that scenario could not have been any better for bnk like it was
1:12:48
likely just Baron goes over they're going to be able to take out our Inhibitors they've bought themselves some time and maybe a few more Miracle
1:12:54
team fights they're still significantly down on gold but again you couldn't have asked for a better scenario a better
1:13:00
result of that Baron take than what they got yeah I do want to say that DRX should not let this bother them though I
1:13:06
think actually like forcing that Baron keeping the tempo up as much as possible is what this composition wants to do you
1:13:13
want to be on that front foot at all times uh when you are a composition like this especially when you're running into
1:13:20
like I mentioned before a bit more of an unab Bunga style team fight composition that wants to set up Circles and make
1:13:25
you go up in the air and be stunned and stuff like that uh so I think keeping it up keeping your foot on the gas that's
1:13:31
going to work out sole Point has already been picked up here by DRX in 1 minute until that ocean soul does come in and
1:13:38
we haven't spoken about it in quite a while because poke poke composition sort of like went out of Vogue but uh ocean
1:13:44
soul has always been good for those it lets you win elongated fight if you're
1:13:49
able to you know just keep disengaging and Landing the Poke where you can best also loves having two just standard
1:13:57
Elemental oceans in her back pocket when she's sidelining into a Jax you know that extra health she's going to be getting when she you know stops
1:14:03
interacting with him heals it back up then goes in for some more trades it's going to feel amazing for her and Rich
1:14:09
has already kind of been crushing this s Side Lane all game long so outside of when they actually One V one which is
1:14:15
where uh clear has been finding some decent angles it's just not showing up like you say like Rich has been keeping
1:14:21
up in farm just fine every time we see the matchup it feel feels like CLE is winning but he's just not well it's not
1:14:27
it's not fair for clear because the team has no map control no one can Shadow him yeah it's a bit unfortunate Diablo going
1:14:33
to get tagged there by the void Seeker got some upgraded shoes from lazy feel as
1:14:39
well DNK finally being able to walk their way out onto the map they haven't lost any turrets or anything like that
1:14:45
they didn't get much out of this Baron at all there is the dragon lazy field going to start this one up immediately I
1:14:51
love this solar play just gets a slow onto sponge as the weav as Wall comes in Kell not really finding very many
1:14:56
buttons as handle keeps vicka out of there that is going to confirm the ocean soul as true shop barrage not getting a
1:15:02
lot of value and the void seek also not going to connect Now Rich going for a bit of an engage as Raptor cycloning
1:15:07
just to try and save his skin K desperately engaging but he's going to go down these health bars are so low
1:15:13
they get away from clear so comfortably does lazy feel and vicker is now running away the shock blast tags The Cheeky
1:15:21
Monkey trying to escape and it is only vicka left I think DRX is going to say good night to this game right here I
1:15:27
think so and what a beautiful game for DRX it was oh dear okay teleport does
1:15:33
come through CU of course there is no CC on the N so you don't need to be too worried however all this is going to
1:15:39
provide vicka is the ability to watch his Nexus turrets explode and oh that's
1:15:45
a nice little uh little immune there but it is not going to really do too much both Nexus turret and the Nexus and DRX
1:15:52
I just want to say gorgeous execution of this composition what a great game by
1:15:57
them I mean start to finish and's vision control absolutely out of this world his positioning in that last fight too where
1:16:04
he just steps up into everybody and says you have to come through me if you want to get this Dragon AR kaisa is so fed in
1:16:11
this game that she could solo it so quickly you want to come over and contest you're going to have to get through this front line your flanks are
1:16:16
going to get broken you're not going to be able to actually set up for that uh Tia engage that you want we just not
1:16:22
going to let anybody in and when they kind of do try to say well we have to stop this Dragon they just get pulled
1:16:27
apart massively and I don't think there were big glaring issues in the draft
1:16:33
here for bnk in fact I think there were some bigger risks on the draft of DRX especially like they didn't have set up
1:16:38
for the NY but they played around the vision game so well they always had Wards to see where to poke with the naly where the shock blast could go all the
1:16:45
objective setups they had around the drag or rather the baron pit the wards that were constantly put there by andil
1:16:51
there were never any unknowns they followed Rich around the map they made sure the Jacks couldn't beat him in a s Side Lane start to become a threat later
1:16:57
on this was a team effort a fiveman DRX that I want to see more of yeah I really
1:17:03
want to see more of it as well and let's have a look at this right now this composition if the names were not the
1:17:09
DRX players and this was geni plays instead you'd be like oh man this composition is terrifying like this is
1:17:16
one of the best drafts I've ever seen right because it needs to be piloted well to look good and damn DRX they made
1:17:22
it look good and that's not what I was expecting here today in our first series beautiful stuff thankfully it is the
1:17:28
best of three so bnk an opportunity to try and take one back as they have against almost every other team that theyve faced off against see if they can
1:17:35
do it after this short break in the space breaking that first game down

1:24:17
hello and welcome to the space we're here after game number one hi everybody
1:24:23
we just had DRX up against bnk and that one wasn't the most interesting game but
1:24:28
it did have some cool moments which we will be breaking down here in just a moment I'm vales today uh Deon is well
1:24:35
gone and we do have ox and waded joining me how are you guys feeling today pretty
1:24:40
good you know I feel like we have some close matchups today which uh you know yesterday was pretty one-sided bro
1:24:46
obviously toppling geni easily as we expected yeah I mean today's matchup is
1:24:51
definitely one of the Massy games like one of the messy games so I really
1:24:56
having fun with some good insights because maybe some of them will say this game is kind of boring but I think they
1:25:03
had some good details so like I really want to like just break down the game yeah there were some cool details uh
1:25:10
specifically W they did want to look at something that happened very early on in the game at 1 minute in take us uh take
1:25:16
us through what happened here so it's all about the gang set from UK call uh maybe I was thinking about vigla
1:25:22
shouldn't put that trinket w uh at the brush but it does make sense because need always can uh just jump through the
1:25:29
pit and go to the blue side so it's all about the UK call trades at level one uh
1:25:34
I think vicka didn't misplay that much but uh I think UK call just outplayed
1:25:40
here so much uh you can speed up a little bit here and then you can see his
1:25:46
control with a hammer he just deals tons of damage at level one
1:25:52
and then Force the first P already and then you can speed up once again after
1:25:58
just until the next wave and then you can see he's holding
1:26:03
the way with the range minions so it gives a space for the need to come
1:26:10
around so he transformed to the Hammer so he actually forced out the Talia e which is really important for him and
1:26:16
then after that it was really easy setup uh for the DRX so all about is that the
1:26:22
Uka was just like baiting him uh the skill shots and also like those
1:26:27
kind of small details from the moves was really important and that actually snowballs the game really hard
1:26:32
especially cuz like wolf was talking about with the draft they didn't have the setup that we typically see with n compositions like nly reekon is that
1:26:39
tried andr combo cuz you have the point and click stun so it does take your laners doing more work to set you up but
1:26:44
when a situation like this happens it just makes the game so easy for sponge and it was very easy you know the NY got
1:26:49
ahead the Jace got ahead DRX as a whole got ahead they got the Feats of Strength everything was going very well for them
1:26:56
and then bnk decided to try to turn things around with a dive of sorts this
1:27:02
definitely feels a bit desperate but it's like they don't have the information they don't see that the kais is coming up they see there two togs
1:27:09
they try and focus down the N but they end up just factoring into a situation where with the turret there as well it's
1:27:14
a 4V three you're already behind I think that's one of the plays where you needed a bit more information and they would
1:27:19
have made the decision to back off if they had that information I mean I'm not going to lie like whenever I see uh bfx
1:27:27
like plan to dive or like do something as a team they never really like look like a planned for something you know
1:27:33
because of the skill shots you could see Leona missing his ulti missing his Flash and also ukong just flashing randomly I
1:27:40
mean all these things you can actually pre-plan and talk about it you know like let's just flash on one Target and then
1:27:46
like just uh we can actually Force really hard on the war Target for example like you can always like talk
1:27:52
before the pre-show as we we are doing for this right now I think it's super dangerous when you're playing into like a NY and AIS as well because those
1:27:58
Champions if you do mess up it's very hard to like get a kill and get out cuz they will chase you down they have a lot of Mobility a lot of Chase potential and
1:28:06
I think just not factoring in these things when they're going for these plays they just need to pre-plan really well and that will make like easier for
1:28:14
them to actually execute the the plays yeah it's pretty difficult I mean you
1:28:19
know you're coming into the beginning of 2025 you've got a new roster you know via's back ybl pulled up so it feels
1:28:26
like there's a lot of different people being combined now into this team and maybe they don't quite have that you
1:28:32
know that awareness that coordination as a team just yet and I think unfortunately for their chances in the
1:28:38
lck cup they don't have time uh they need wins because especially with Bros defeat of geneng yesterday they are now
1:28:45
at the bottom of the group but if things don't change especially if they don't beat DRX here they probably will be that
1:28:50
bottom team and they will be out so they need things to turn around quickly and they don't really have that time to develop the Synergy they need yeah it's
1:28:57
pretty interesting to see the development of all the teams we have here at the 2025 LSK cup because DRX
1:29:02
looking very strong UK Cal coming back he's looking great things are looking good for them we expected a close Series
1:29:09
in this first one but so far it is all DRX all the way we're going to throw it back to our casters for game number two
1:29:15
take it away guys thank you very much Bzz and the boys on the space great
1:29:20
breakdown good to see that uh the full elongated trade makeup of UK there
1:29:27
really dissecting you know what made that first play work out so incredibly well and I think that that setup really
1:29:33
put them in the right standing to make everything happen so I think this mid lane matchup is going to have even more
1:29:39
of a microscope as we head into game two yeah and I do wonder what the draft is going to look like again DX's biggest weakness to me has been the drafting uh
1:29:46
and when they have a draft that even that last draft we didn't think was an amazing draft but it was definitely playable can be quite challenging to
1:29:53
play out but they played it so well so I I do think that moving into game two thinks a little trickier right it's
1:29:59
Fearless a lot of Champions are now removed and as a result uh you know we will see what they plan on bringing out
1:30:07
some of the other picks that we we saw come through and a lot of our other big series like the Y we're absent from this so that one's still uh one to be
1:30:13
considered I think VI is a very strong y player yep see what bnk have planned for
1:30:20
us you can see Rio is already chatting it out before we even get into that draft they will pick blue side obviously
1:30:26
yep usual and yeah I'm I'm interested because
1:30:32
you're right there could just be a big fumble uh from DRX they may not necessarily have as much of a clear game
1:30:37
plan we've seen that blue side has been a lot stronger as far as formulating a draft that uh you really like the look
1:30:43
of and there was some weird stuff that happened last time around as well remember it was like the Ezreal Leona were coming out immediately and then we
1:30:50
saw like the Leona was basically a liability throughout the game they didn't get a lot of value out of the Ezreal blind pick so yeah he was just so
1:30:57
something else is going to have to happen this time around yeah I mean the N was accelerated the the Jace was accelerated right and so you know
1:31:03
unfortunately for Diablo that Ezreal two item Spike just came a little too late to to be impactful and they never had
1:31:09
those 5v5 fights they were're looking for yeah so far the first two bands here we've already seen Rumble and kalista
1:31:15
picks like the Aurora going up in priority though I think in this draft with uh it being game two yeah I feel
1:31:22
like there is there's a different priority for game two than there is for game one like I think it's actually really really cool you get a lot of
1:31:28
picks out of the way and then that opens the door for other things to come in because now you're not going to see an ambessa or Jace like this uh the kaisa
1:31:35
Ezreal situation means that now varis Ash probably going to be coming up in priority as well the Cante is still a
1:31:41
big consideration Rumble is banned as well so see if that one does get banned
1:31:46
again the scarner is a must ban like you can't let that one through uh you know period so you have to make a tough
1:31:53
choice that third spot whether it's going to be Cante Aurora or perhaps even something like a forest or
1:31:58
Ash all right so final band to come through now for BN K this will decide
1:32:04
whether we do see varas sash this game because if they ban one of them the other one gets banned here by uh DRX
1:32:09
very likely might be a good idea as well to be honest but instead it's going to be the Aurora like you were saying the game two priority going up and that is
1:32:16
going to be taken away from UK or Rich yeah maybe we just trade Ash vest and B
1:32:22
Cante here cuz if you ban one of the ash or the vars the other one goes through like you said so clear is also an
1:32:27
amazing gante player I think yeah Banning that makes a lot of sense the vi is the other thing that was banned away
1:32:32
in the in the first game so that could be snapped up here by Raptor things like Z are still up and available uh
1:32:39
certainly going to be an opportunity here for lazy field to jump on that if he wants to I don't know whether just anyone can uh play the Z and I don't
1:32:47
know whether they should be picking it immediately no you do have to see the rest of the draft to see whether the value is actually going to be there I
1:32:53
think the VI for pick here makes a lot of sense um but you know if you go for
1:32:58
if you go for like uh VI then they get Varys and then vars outranges Ash and there's a lot of like factors that go
1:33:04
into this um Ash and VI can work really well together though yeah true and so
1:33:10
you know that may be where we're going here but I think as DRX here you don't even necessarily need to lock the ash in right here anyways you can wait and get
1:33:16
some more additional information and get a strong solo Lane pick with this vi vi
1:33:22
Rumble has been the big combo here in the L so far and the rumble is spanned so there was some hesitation on that VI
1:33:30
lock in but I think it's just such an oppressive pick yeah I don't know what the pick is uh that either UK or Rich
1:33:36
are going to go for here yeah Cante being banned so one of the safer ones Nar has been historically fairly safe I
1:33:43
mean it is a bit of a rich special there as well but blind Nar I mean Nar hasn't found very much success so far in the
1:33:49
lck lck cup should I say and now clear gets to pick whatever he feels like into
1:33:56
this Champion unless it's Esser and uh and Ja not last play I would honestly almost just prefer them taking the blind
1:34:02
Des ear that now we're going to see locked in here for Via uh just because it's a little bit more flexible there's
1:34:07
not a ton of syy between VI and Nar now I trust DRX after watching that game one
1:34:12
that they can play around this narbar well but for some of our lower level teams it can be a very tricky thing to
1:34:18
to control around objective fights and this is one more thing to think about and so not as big of a fan of the Nar
1:34:24
pick as I am this azir we'll see if clear has a counter pick prepared here
1:34:29
for this Nar it's like not yet yeah not going to be coming out yet uh Camille has done okay in the past like there are
1:34:36
a few things that can go Toe to Toe but Jace is the biggest one and that was uh used in the last game so Fus dictates
1:34:42
you're not going to be playing that so zenzel going to be locked in for Raptor like you say holding on to clear's pick for another round interesting I think
1:34:50
silus for some reason just silus sounds like a great idea might be silus uh you
1:34:55
know it's very strong into the azir blocking the raan away would be quite interesting kind of weakening a
1:35:01
potential Zia pick but they could have just banned that instead anyways I'm not 100% on board with this priority I I can
1:35:06
kind of see the idea but very risky pick like a lot of this draft for DRX for me doesn't really work well together I'm
1:35:13
not saying that Recon and and V can't have Synergy but it doesn't work well with the Nar necessarily just yet
1:35:19
putting this in face up gives opportunities for bnk to have a great response po is instantly banned yeah I
1:35:25
don't mind it when TOA was played last game and Poppy can be banned on this rotation they can do it for free so the
1:35:31
raan value is likely to just be there also an enemy zire is almost impossible
1:35:36
so it is going to be banned here right bnk should probably ban away the lovers Duo um but it does sort of take up a
1:35:43
band slot and means that UK's uh picks are going to be pretty wide open unless they just decide to ban things like Ari
1:35:49
like viari is very very strong so going to remove that yeah you could also end
1:35:54
up opting into a victory here for some of the scaling damage but it just doesn't really fit this composition like
1:36:00
the arri does so I think it's wise that's banned I don't think we're going to see like a landre out of him or anything crazy like that but there are
1:36:07
some options Ral is a smart choice here yeah and you know that can be a pretty oppressive setup of the vars and the
1:36:13
rata even if it's just leaning into a Nar um so feel like a psychological
1:36:19
thing as well right you know you ban Kell's comfortable Champions so that is going to have difficulty getting back on
1:36:26
his feet because that first game was not his best he's probably going to have to play alist now as a Ki like you say he's
1:36:32
going to be banned away common counter pick to the azir uh not one I'd say UK is as known as as known for as some of
1:36:39
our other mid laners but this gets really interesting here can lock the ad carry now and save that
1:36:47
ukel final uh like mystery pick and the question becomes what is going to be
1:36:53
that 8 carry Misfortune is you know decent with the lock down they have especially if you
1:36:58
can set up a really nice Nar like that there is some incredible combo potential with the Recon ultimate as well so I'm
1:37:04
actually on board with this one it's going to get out ranged uh you know in the early laning phase and can be out poked but when the setup is there it
1:37:11
works really well now will we see something crazy here for Clear like a GP into the Nar reekon you know can be a
1:37:18
tough one to play into n but one that can if given resources from raptor can win out look like that's what they're
1:37:24
going to opt to it's one of clear's alltime favorites Y and yeah it doesn't
1:37:29
really speak to me like oh this is going to counter the N because often times people Pick N into it but in the current
1:37:35
iteration I think it's uh going to work out just fine and in the 2v2 I think it is going to be all right as well given
1:37:40
the early brawling power of the zinzow as Kellen thinking about the elite
1:37:46
support that will be locked in that is so much leaning power against what isn't
1:37:51
really there as much on on the side of DRX so that's going to be potentially just a lane swap yeah I I think we will
1:37:58
see the lane swap for sure but Oriana is what ucal is considering here for this
1:38:04
final pick does work well with the vi somewhat of a ball carrier with the ultimate there and does have some great
1:38:10
Mobility zerth is more fun zerth is definitely more fun that's going to give them some range as well I was about to
1:38:17
say like Oh I'm a bit worried about the low range well um you then just put an artillery rock guy in the mid
1:38:24
and that do it that being said I mean zerth was originally back when air first came out
1:38:31
zerth was the counter pick this was 2015 right yeah I mean look I I'll give you
1:38:36
that zerth outranges air in the lane and he's great in the lane he is one of the
1:38:41
least mobile Champions that you could play in the mid lane into a xinou azir foris Elise and Reen hey what if you
1:38:48
just never in Shuffle range sure I guess maybe you know maybe this work out I think DRX have had have kind of a
1:38:55
mishmash draft here that can work if it executed perfectly I think this is one is a lot tougher to Pilot than when we
1:39:01
the one we had in game one that we still had some question marks about you know no setup for the N Etc they played it beautifully so I don't want to fully
1:39:07
doubt them whereas on the other side I feel like you have a draft that's quite robust is very proven and very basic the
1:39:14
one question mark I have is how well will Kell pilot El Le because he was definitely the weak link for them I
1:39:19
would say in a lot of those fights in on the Leona in game one and you cannot mess around with especially into a VI
1:39:26
composition playing too aggressively and misjudging the situation on the least because she's incredibly squishy she
1:39:31
will get popped repel is kind of a trap you feel safe with it but as Barrel has showcased many times you're probably
1:39:37
just going to die if you make an error of positioning yeah um what uh Barrel has also proven though is that you can
1:39:43
die 10 times and still very comfortably win the game so maybe that's what
1:39:48
they're trying to angle for see whether it works as we jump on the rift for game two
1:40:02
[Music] wow that is a very extravagant Misfortune skin uh I like it as bnk
1:40:10
we're going for a little bit of a gank brush there as rich is going to just walk away from it um speaking of
1:40:16
extravagant look at ow my goodness looks like drenai drenai armor from uh the
1:40:21
burning Crusade yeah just real shiny as yeah lazy F there there's just too much
1:40:26
stuff going on there well UK does have Comet um see what the rest of his runes
1:40:33
are going to be here that's going to be for laning prowess obviously and uh that is what he is looking to accomplish with
1:40:40
this pick you can Snowball the game he can follow up from so far away onto sponge uh when he does go for the
1:40:47
ultimate also onto Rich if you can set up a nice nnar okay yeah we Scout this one out so
1:40:55
no Lane swap I mean it's double lane swaps but like ideally um you know I think you wanted to avoid the Elise but
1:41:01
they're actually going to match and go up your top side and facee off against the varis so confident that they can
1:41:06
actually win this one out yeah and also possible vertical jungling to come in here as well as I believe information
1:41:13
will go over to DRX in time for sponge to be able to react know it's so hard
1:41:18
for zerth to actually do anything about this you know as a champion he's like oh yeah can't really do I can't hurt that
1:41:24
xinou right now so sorry about that that's all right Kelling going aggressive but actually good trade on
1:41:31
DX's side lazy field picking up some of that spling money love to see that can't
1:41:37
do that on the other side right so that's just that's just free there is there are pings here from DRX towards
1:41:44
where raptor is now this is something that you could do to punish the ginal attempt as it turns out they did know
1:41:50
double up going to connect there on Raptor as we're not going going to see Sponge over here to help out Kon going to land as that's an immediate cleanse
1:41:56
from lazy field there is no turret that's going to help them out as the ignite goes down onto andle wind becomes lightning and I don't think they're
1:42:02
going to die but uh this is still real bad news for DRX I think this is really
1:42:07
leaning into what we did was asking for you know is come into a game like this with a really good plan and they
1:42:14
certainly have set up the lane exactly the way they want Raptor comes up here and they force lazy field and andil to
1:42:20
respond or else raptor is just going to win out in the jungle and they just can't win this 3v3 it's really not even
1:42:25
a 3v3 is unfortunately for sponge he wasn't there in time so ends up being a really nice early exchange here for BN K
1:42:33
yeah working out really nicely as sponge also is like well and truly Behind Enemy Lines right now uh won't be able to take
1:42:41
away this blue buff just yet as let's see what he decides to do not full
1:42:46
information but I think NOS that raptor is in the vicinity is oh that was so cheeky that was so cheeky it's really
1:42:53
common to let your pet get the last hit there and he punishes that that was actually really well played by Sponge
1:42:58
and gets away y now he's got a gank opportunity exactly Kell 50% Health as
1:43:03
we can see here and wants to actually go on Ward as we could see andle will he be able to find the opportunity looks like
1:43:09
they're just going to give a bit of a a helping hand to the wave that is what uh
1:43:15
sponge is after as Raptor's going to move up grand entrance going to knock up the Varys here as Raptor comes in but
1:43:21
the battle dance andle has his going to work out there repel gets Kell out of trouble but I think Raptor being the
1:43:26
only one that's healthy is going to mean that this is going to go over to DRX and they kind of brute forcing but it is
1:43:32
giving them control back in this Lane yeah was uh really well played there by
1:43:37
Sponge and then they kind of turn this Lane on his head he cleared the wave super fast put some damage through and
1:43:44
hel has to repel defensively and now they're trying to take back control the jungle y g moving on over but andle's
1:43:50
going to be here as well fleing quill going connect vicker is very low as his UK as they've been trading blows quite a
1:43:57
lot the sherean battle Yeah zerth doing what uh it says on the tin I always
1:44:04
steal that phrase from you cuz it's it's one of the best Caster terms I've ever heard I mean it is it is very effective
1:44:10
as oh that was not the teleport that you're looking out for interesting that he's taken teleport glad that we made a note of that as andle is probably dead
1:44:17
yeah he is and so that doesn't quite work out Dia comes back with the items that he's looking for and lazy standing
1:44:23
in the brush here is going to be okay gets the flash out trades it for his but man dible is mad about what happened in
1:44:30
game one that was some sick play I mean he's he he is willing to trade his life
1:44:35
for First Blood initially cuz he's like okay feet of strink that's that's big for us that's huge if we're able to to
1:44:40
successfully do that I'm confident I can get that first kill it plays that super confidently and then lasfeld kind of hesitates and he's like no I think I win
1:44:46
this too oh Kell going for a bit of a gank onto UK here is uh he's just going to walk it off
1:44:53
yeah that's uh enough that's the kind of power you have over this low uh Mobility
1:44:59
zerth to just make a ram like this happen and that's what Extra Value they got while diao was onv twoing the play
1:45:06
top side is that Kell can come down here and potentially make a play still has his flash available neither of the DRX
1:45:11
bot laners have uh Summoners lazy FS getting his cleanse back in just a moment o andil thinking about uh trying
1:45:19
to set something up there for UK doesn't quite work out there as sponge going to be going back home still hadn't actually
1:45:25
recalled yet so needs to purchase some items but that's going to mean that he's
1:45:30
not there for when these grubs do spawn andle has that control wood in the pit they know exactly what's going on Sponge
1:45:35
trying to get over here as quickly as possible and Kellen has been so incredibly sneaky on this
1:45:44
spider as all right Andel and lazy field feeling like they have an opportunity but I don't know whether they really want to that flash cocoon was not it
1:45:51
from Kell going to be able mitigate the uh turret damage and dible actually offers back a whole lot anyway I think
1:45:58
that would have meant that that's a kill or at least a cleanse as Raptor moves in
1:46:03
sweeps out this Ward actually puts down a control W I don't know about that one as Raptor does have to flash there a lot
1:46:09
of DRX bad guys set up here now the rest of his team moves over can this 3v3 work out it's Ken oh no he's going to get
1:46:15
knocked back by the Vault breaker and now it's a 2v3 sponge going to have to flash to get out of the way but the
1:46:21
double knockup is there from command and Diablo just grabs two kills the minions
1:46:26
get mad at him but not mad enough and Andel I don't even know whether you win this one V one buddy that's a level six
1:46:33
Dia he did use his ultimate in that exchange my man Dia oh this guy has got
1:46:38
the whole team on his back my guy yeah he has really locked into this one and
1:46:44
uh he salvaged what was looking like it was going to end up being a horrendous play for BN K with just massive damage
1:46:51
he missed a few Q leading into this as well watch him on the teleport 1v2 now
1:46:57
he's in the shop shows up pet shot goes through
1:47:03
put oh really nicely done waits for it yep and then here he don't have he
1:47:10
doesn't have the reset on the auto hits the cannon to try to do so has to flash had W as well so that was definitely a
1:47:16
dead MF that was really scary really good Flash and then here I mean Kell
1:47:22
used his Flash earlier to try to make that heroic play and he whiffed it and then didn't have his flash to escape
1:47:27
here um but Diablo just walks forward knows he has a damage skill sponge forces sponge to flash La F gets killed
1:47:33
and then he control Wards here to stop the Minions from being able to chase him as well the value was absolutely obscene
1:47:40
from like every button he hit like three people with the hail of arrows stacked up blight all over the place and then
1:47:46
hits like three with the piercing Arrow as well like man and he's now 1,000 gold ahead serrated Dirk in hand
1:47:53
I mean there's no money for lazy field he's just incredibly behind even with two kills yeah chains of corruption
1:47:59
comes down and I don't know what sponge is going to be able to do here is andle gets on in but dible he's still at half
1:48:04
health and lazy feel he ain't doing anything about this and yes andle gets out but that is two very quick kills for
1:48:10
bnk I mean bnk are so ahead that they can make plays like this but this is one of the issues I have in this composition
1:48:16
with theera is that when the azir comes into a skirmish like this with when you know you're running this Renekton and
1:48:22
shin like you're going to Skirmish a lot in the early game and the Zer is kind of like well I don't want any part of that
1:48:27
by the way I I think there's a little bit too many champions that can get on top of me over there so good luck uh I'm
1:48:34
not going to join and you know that is just the dragon going over here to BN K
1:48:40
uh and you know now you're looking at two kills on an air um the reekon is naturally ahead in the lane and uh yeah
1:48:48
this is uh it's old but the crying would you say uh um Atlas that you know my
1:48:54
theory about sometimes D drafts get a little wonky and then uh yeah I'm uh I'm seeing I'm seeing that I'm picking up
1:49:03
what you're putting down I'm not taking anything away from diao who's had a phenomenal game um individually cuz this
1:49:10
game could look very different if he didn't play all of those moments on the top side as incredibly well as he did
1:49:15
but you can see some of the pitfalls of this track God yeah he's he's uh ahead
1:49:21
he is I mean lazy feel almost has as much money as Kell and ucal as well very
1:49:26
poor right now even though he has actually got some Farm I think lazy feel may have like a plate or two or
1:49:32
something like no he doesn't uh so just was involved in a little bit more grabb those couple of kills which is why he
1:49:37
does have some money that could look way worse if it was you know sponge that grabbed the kills or something like that
1:49:43
as Now Rich just trying to trade where he can still very far away from any of the items that he's looking for as K
1:49:50
setting up for this next round of grubs could be six grubs as well as completed Feats of Strength it's not a horrible
1:49:57
Choice the recan priority but it's a bit puzzling and it's a bit risky it's not as as um High fro as the Corky where
1:50:05
we're like oh God like that that Corky game against T1 where you're like o this is just game losing before we even
1:50:11
finish the draft but it it certainly feels very bizarre you know and these are the kind of decisions we've seen DRX make sometimes that make you scratch
1:50:16
your head a little bit yeah and I mean I think more egregious is just the blind
1:50:23
Nar out of nowhere right that's also weird like we don't need to make decisions like that um but Rich of
1:50:30
course you know he does have like specific Champion pools like and he wants to play certain things on certain
1:50:36
days and it's not his fault by any means things certainly went wrong elsewhere uh
1:50:41
to make this game in the position that it is via is going to make such quick work of this turret by the way six grubs
1:50:47
for BN K and he doesn't even have his Nash's tooth yet but he does so much he
1:50:53
will now have it by the way yeah and they also they they just completed F strength by getting first uh first
1:50:59
dragon as well as all of the grubs and so we don't even see first turret Blood come up on the screen as far as a fe of
1:51:05
strength but they would have they would have got it as you basically alluding to I kind of hope I I kind of wish that
1:51:10
they did do it retroactively just cuz it would be nice to see all of the lights yeah you know uh underneath the kill
1:51:16
score so uh maybe we could think about doing that I can see it lit up yellow in my mind side yeah right but I don't want
1:51:22
to have to employ my mind's eye for that as yeah BK just fully in control of
1:51:28
absolutely everything around the map right now they are it at a over 3,000 gold lead at 12 minutes it's heading
1:51:34
towards shellacking territory already as lazy field heading towards this brush would be a mistake currently out of
1:51:41
vision though which is important get that Ward over this is going to force sponge to come down here and you can see
1:51:46
UK is trying to make a Roam and let's see how well this goes cuz he's not being matched by Vi right now and stands
1:51:53
his ground as when becomes lightning will allow Raptor to get in there does have Al this air with Nash is going to
1:51:59
get another plate all the all the while you know while you're kind of trying to come over here and make an impact UK is going to lose a plate here doesn't
1:52:05
actually commit to the play and you know they're staving the pressure off technically speaking like nobody's dying
1:52:10
but you're losing more money anyways like there plates going down to Mid there plates going down to bottom
1:52:15
and now via faster on the rotation yeah you can see bnk they are hungry for blood the cocon going to miss once again
1:52:22
but lazy field just continuing to take poke damage the volatile spiderling comes in that's going to help out and
1:52:28
they get more plates chains of corruption does get the cleanse out from lazy field he'll take that trade any day
1:52:34
of the week though because this turret continues to go lower and lower and all right let's see where the sponge can
1:52:39
make this happen there's the Vault breaker flash as they try and land all the buttons and they will be able to successfully do so UK hits the ulti
1:52:46
that's going to work out andle taking a fair bit of damage as lazy feel is dead to a Q and he presses the ultimate
1:52:53
button just to clear out the minion wave that was scary cuz you know what as he it it was on cool down for now I guess I
1:53:00
was going to say League of Legends enthusiasts know that you can't move when you're using bullet time ability oh
1:53:05
no yeah we got the zoom in it's okay you got a kill um the build of UK in this
1:53:11
game too of the first archangels does kind of tell some of the story of how scared he is into the enemy draft Yeah
1:53:19
uh okay have to flashing um sponge is really dead guys uh super duper Dead uh
1:53:25
it's going to take a little bit of time but eventually it is going to be the hail of arrows that locks him down we got a little bit excited about that kill
1:53:31
earlier and just wanted to push some additional advantages potentially but uh very much oversteep the mark yeah so
1:53:40
3,000 turning into about 4,000 as far as the lead is concerned level 11 for UK so has upgraded that uh ultimate the dragon
1:53:49
here uh setup for bnk is is pretty good when you consider clear also has teleport he doesn't have to worry about
1:53:55
a narbar or anything like that uh to to come over here and manage this fight this is a really nice setup from sponge
1:54:01
he has control Ward here and he's able to flash buffer his Q in sets up the old followup here from ucal is phenomenal
1:54:09
that was just really easy really well set up there by Zer burst damage is going to be really strong and
1:54:15
SP yeah he didn't have the information that uh Raptor was there and so it was
1:54:21
unfortunately unable to make that one work yeah this was uh just a bit greedy
1:54:26
unfortunately and that's another kill for Diablo I didn't actually see initially that he was only picked it up 40 and two my goodness building towards
1:54:35
the next Durk item as well as stacking up that tier and lazy field does have his blood thirst now complete but this
1:54:41
Misfortune is basically doing nothing decent wall up there from Rich but you can see this gold lead is just moving up
1:54:48
to the right beautifully done that's what a coach wants to see yeah and not a DRX coach right now
1:54:56
probably no not that coach yeah but yes Ryu is probably yeah smile and yeah R
1:55:01
and you know as the meme dictates he doesn't get to do that very often on the internet um so it's a good time
1:55:08
especially after his team hasn't found a victory it's going to mean a whole lot winning game twos though that's something that bnk have proven that they
1:55:14
can do it's winning the game threes that's been the difficult part or the game two after winning a game
1:55:20
one I I I'm looking look at this game and I've been trying to Rack my brain
1:55:25
like how do DRX get back in it and I feel like the only real angle is like
1:55:31
Rich hits a crazy Nar into the wall on like three people with a bullet time cuz I don't think that you know sponge alone
1:55:37
he's one one of the best Champs to set up a pick is going to be able to get it done because they're significantly far
1:55:43
behind and some of the best pick targets you're going to have are going to be like the Elise who may be able to repel ahead away rather should be fine
1:55:49
although sponge is just going to dive in that is a max range bullet time to help lock that one down sponge almost dies to
1:55:56
calculat baby that is down to 10 Health 10 health so I didn't think they were going to go for it but he does ultimately just barely do it and kill
1:56:04
while getting away so I'll eat my words on that one I thought VI was going to be fine had flash to didn't use it oh
1:56:09
chains corruption going to land as the mega Nar is set up here for Rich doesn't get a wallup or anything like that
1:56:14
though and look at DIA he's just standing his ground Kellen able to land the Cocoon that's beautifully done Ino
1:56:21
sponge though looks for the opportunity now as rich just smashes down Raptor
1:56:26
this could be the turn because somehow UK lived yes there is a a crocodile pushing on the top side and now Ken is
1:56:33
going to die but dible is back and Rich was an auto attack away from dead clear
1:56:38
is now going to teleport in can the Vault breaker actually work out though that's the question as rich is going to be taken out decent knock up from Andel
1:56:45
but I don't know whether sponge is making it out of this one does get a vault breaker and he needs another one
1:56:51
but it's not going to work out the ruthless predor oh that was actually very very cute his almost has flashback oh yeah really cute stuff but the just
1:56:58
says no presses q and he's dead his flash was like 1 second away might have been able to get out there with it would
1:57:04
have felt terrible about using it but either way didn't get it in the nick of time and is taken out the fifth kill
1:57:10
goes over to Diablo we had a little bit of yakety Sacks on that one I'd say but uh ultimately it's still a win for bnk
1:57:17
there at the end as uh ucal survived for so long go back to the play I mentioned
1:57:22
you know by single Target blow up you know lock down super important when you're behind like this if you can find
1:57:28
a single Target this is the exactly the kind of play that DRX need to be looking for from behind they were successful and
1:57:36
Diablo here putting a ton of damage in but not quite able to finish off UK here even with Kell coming over with this
1:57:42
cocoon the ignite goes down as well he's super low he just narrowly survives here now you're just a bit too far forward
1:57:48
and this isn't going to be one of those moments where you're like oh there's no shot calling voice maybe the call was a little bit too firm on this one to go in
1:57:55
and they end up getting punished however with the teleport from clear this still ends up being a win here for bnk I had
1:58:01
to expend a lot of resources in order to get said win but their gold lead of fors them this play if it was a more even
1:58:06
game State this probably would have felt really bad for BN K but clear is just like ah I can TP in we got this and
1:58:12
sponge will ultimately go down his flash is like 1 second away but he still gets sniped well speaking of clear he is uh
1:58:18
going to kill Rich uh Diablo is going to die though that's going to be a big deal lots of money over to
1:58:24
UK honestly that that could be a turnaround although it is still you know close to a 5,000 gold lead at this point
1:58:30
in time but that is now a very very scary zerth was it 11,000 though that bnk was ahead against CH on and didn't
1:58:38
win the game oh should we be doing should we be doing I'm just saying anything's possible Atlas it is true um
1:58:45
don't let your dreams be dreams or something as clear he's relatively low
1:58:52
look if you're going to get a shut down you know onto Diablo I think it is good that it goes to UK he's got six stacks
1:58:58
of dark seal he's got a needlessly large rod in his inventory it's going to give him a needlessly large amount of AP and
1:59:04
maybe that will be um what helps him get back into this game right now though looking at Soul Point going over as
1:59:10
we'll go back to what happened here as Rich's narbar expires he uses his crush
1:59:16
and is now unable to escape because he doesn't have Flash so that was pretty basic there yeah good play from uh
1:59:23
Raptor to come and punish that one as dible is engaged on here and yeah they throw the kitchen
1:59:30
sink at him and UK lands all of his uh ultimate buttons and he is going to be
1:59:36
okay is all right um we have arakan on the bottom side of the map Andel trying to make his way in doesn't actually get
1:59:43
there they do have information but do they have access Nar bar here for rich is pretty big but doesn't have Flash oh
1:59:48
actually the knout control is really good unable to get the transformation as he makes his way in but in goes onil
1:59:55
they blow up the jungler sponges in the pit can they kill him before it goes down oh my God Aon is secured by Dia of
2:00:04
all people and now it is Elementary they'll take down rich as well it was so
2:00:10
close to being good and then it was a disaster yeah I mean if this was an even
2:00:15
game State again I keep saying that but I feel like DRX are fighting these these fights out pretty well thear was optimal
2:00:22
he smed it to 25 Health yeah that's not even even game State that's just he missed a Smite yeah well I mean old
2:00:29
Smite would have maybe back oh yeah he would have had an extra level or something doesn't even work anymore but
2:00:36
like the the situation here for DRX I mean the peel for lazy peel as well 100
2:00:42
damage and he s if he sacrifices himself and gets the Smite then maybe they actually just commit you know further
2:00:48
into this fight probably not cuz I don't think you win it but they can get out they'll have their wings but fortunately for them it's bnk who end up winning
2:00:55
that fight and that was with everything going right for DRX sponge being able to get in there to Smite with the the nice
2:01:01
engage from Mel with Rich having his narbar and they still can't win it and now it's it's looking pretty
2:01:06
doomed y they need the wave clear to get over here thankfully good old Zera does have a lot of that uh as bnk don't care
2:01:14
about it that much CU they have six grubs and so they can just stand there B's really finding out like he's like
2:01:20
how strong is Bor right now yeah um as it turns out not quite as
2:01:25
strong as maybe we once thought there's ad moving over a possible little engage
2:01:31
here on the side seent assist coming on in as UK going to be out off for the damage and there it is just rains down a
2:01:38
bunch of Arcane stuff on the crocodile and they'll sacrifice in a turret and inhibit a turret for it and it's not
2:01:44
worth Viet throws an ultimate Tania but that's where it can go it doesn't really matter too much he is going to be sent
2:01:49
home once again lazy field almost dead and every kill the bnk gets is a big deal dible will go down I don't think
2:01:55
raptor is getting too much more here as there are four bad guys around him and lazy f is just dead my God man because
2:02:03
remember it's 100 gold and like some blood pedals or something if they go down but the kills on the DRX they stick
2:02:11
yeah they really do yeah this looks initially like oh man looks like maybe clear made a big error going back in
2:02:16
here doesn't have his Dominus just yet you can see it's coming back but he gets picked but all the wild they're push
2:02:22
this is the same sort of thing we saw Rich do in the side last game where we're starting to see teams actually use Aon correctly you know super deep like
2:02:29
that get something extra valuable now via missing his Shuffle here is actually pretty huge cuz it's probably what's going to cost them getting this
2:02:35
inhibitor but like you said trading some kills back here for the wings is absolutely fine Raptor gets on top of
2:02:41
lazy feel here and is going to be able to take him out Kell okay somehow yeah
2:02:47
it's just uh just walking up there are some bounties live on the map and DRX
2:02:52
didn't lose their inhibitor which is kind of a big deal they did lose every turret in the mid lane I think Viet did
2:02:58
have his withdrawal available but didn't opt to teleport in which I think was the right call so he still has TP he still
2:03:04
has Flash and he's pushing hard going wide as UK has to flash yep and he able
2:03:09
to battle dance his way out but it's looking dangerous every time anyone gets close to these DRX members I'm just
2:03:16
expecting them to die yeah I mean they're on such a clock here too they have to find some sort of pick but
2:03:21
there's just no control there's no vision for them it's all wiped away vickle gets another turret down here is US just hard side laning didn't even use
2:03:28
his TP to get here so he's got both Summoners he's got a turret down he's just really hitting so hard at this
2:03:33
point in the game and we've seen some of these games where you know UK is playing
2:03:39
well but his team is losing and he's playing zerth into this draft so it's really hard to have a KDA like what he
2:03:44
has and also do the damage he has he's been really set up well by Sponge but it's just too little too late I think in
2:03:49
some of these exchanges unfortunately for him to come back and win this one there may be some miracle fight they can
2:03:54
take though again we've seen some near Miracles we almost saw the oton steel from sponge was just a few health off
2:04:01
this ocean soul here is all but assured though for bnk they have so much vision control here and they're just not giving
2:04:08
up the prios one's going in y looking for diao they will be able to get on top of him will be they be able to get the
2:04:13
kill that's the question is okay B break is going to do it Kell is extremely low the bullet time says good night and
2:04:20
Kell's just going to die are DRX doing it my God the Nar two the knock up from
2:04:26
andil they are selecting their targets and they are executing and there is only one that's
2:04:32
dead they sacrifice only lazy feel and they will kill clear here as they all chase after him sponge diving forward
2:04:39
and bnk what kind of a lead is enough for you to win a series I know it's it's
2:04:45
the question I think we're all going to be asking even if they bring us to three in this one the coaching staff is not going to be happy with these last two
2:04:50
exchanges why going to drag to take Baron guys it's okay to you know
2:04:56
aggressively go for you know position for pryo like this for everyone had no
2:05:02
idea what to do but for everyone except Dia who is smoked instantly his edge of
2:05:07
Knight is removed he's Ed by a VI and he is just dead instantly the followup here is super easy to play out as everyone
2:05:13
has then split up so much of the damage is gone and uh yeah like you said Raptor kind of panicking in that moment as well
2:05:20
and the shot calling just it the shot call must have been like keep pryo but there was no micro of where people
2:05:26
should be standing and Diablo makes a bit of a rookie mistake there and is punished but isn't protected as you
2:05:31
point out by his teammates either and sponge sees his opportunity man from behind sponge has had a fantastic game
2:05:37
so many of these picks or Y DRX are still in this game yeah and somehow they are like and you've also got UK on like
2:05:44
an 11 KDA in this game with a 10 stack dock seal like what is going on the
2:05:50
zerth does generally stand out of Harm's Way that is true but he really has been able to do what he needs to and get a
2:05:58
whole lot of DPS down how do they win a like a five for one trade when they're
2:06:05
down this much like 7K and I mean now they're still down 5,000 gold and I mean
2:06:12
all it takes to the right setup all it takes to the right target selection well Raptor going to get the knock up on Sponge here as he ceases and desists
2:06:18
that's clear diving into the backline emperess Divide is going to pick up lazy feel and this time BN K are actually
2:06:24
going to find the team fight that they're looking for triple kill from DIA and that's what happens if you don't
2:06:30
kill him in a second nice attempt there the arcano pulses are really hurting they really do nice attempt from andil
2:06:36
to try to set up the bullet time there had a really nice angle for his ultimate but they're just still so far behind TP
2:06:43
here from via will seal the deal looks like we're going to three yeah looks like it as clear is going to push UK
2:06:49
away first Nexus turret will will go down and in pure BK fashion they are
2:06:55
making sure they go the distance in the series as Kell well and truly dead as that arcan pulse lands but that is going
2:07:02
to be them closing this one out and thank goodness they were able to after a very scary team fight yeah some some big
2:07:09
hiccups and I think that we really need to see this team work on its mid to late game shot calling but the early game was
2:07:16
really phenomenal and the way they played around the vertical jungle the top side plays diao just in general
2:07:22
having an incredible mechanical game on the vars is what gave them the snowbally
2:07:27
lead you know the draft from DRX was really risky I I'll be honest I wasn't a big fan of it but I thought after game
2:07:32
one maybe we can trust and ucal individually again I think a very impressive game considering the game State and his opponent's Champions that
2:07:39
he was playing against on this sth but didn't make the impact he was looking for either and despite some heroics it's
2:07:45
still going to three but DRX will have side selection for this final game yeah
2:07:51
and we'll see if they can clean up the drafting a little bit Yeah I want to see that one adjusted uh let's just say that
2:07:56
um thankfully no more blind Nars and things like this I think you need something to really create an archetype
2:08:02
for your composition really put your opponent into some difficult positions because this composition from uh bnk
2:08:09
we're looking at it right here it looks stock standard fantastic works out in the early game and is able to create
2:08:15
like a lot of advantages and it's that bottom Lane that was so powerful and and vica's damage looks so meager 10.9k but
2:08:23
his damage to turrets this game isn't shown in this graph and he did a lot of split pushing a lot of hitting the turrets a lot of a lot of hitting those
2:08:30
turrets those are yeah his his little staff with the zappy zap was getting a whole lot of work done but ladies and
2:08:36
gentlemen we are getting a whole lot of work done today as well because it is three games for our first series let's
2:08:43
go to a quick break when we get back the space is going to break that one down and then we'll have game number three we'll see you soon

you [Music]
2:10:39
for Fore fore
2:10:58
teleports com in from Z as Well's going to have to yeah they do get
2:11:03
Vision look is the magnet Storm from Delight to the back line it's gorgeous
2:11:08
BD tries to get out of there but Z just goes all out
2:11:14
and looks to destroy him peanut is going to be the first one to go down though but now zeka oh God he just targets
2:11:21
every time perfect lying on the floor as well and look at hle they are just
2:11:27
mowing them down Z about 100 health is still going to
2:11:34
[Music] survive and that's just going to be free
2:11:40
as meanwhile a couple of 80 carries going head tohe head the barrier though available and he dumps over ruler just
2:11:47
to die
2:11:54
[Music]
2:12:04
let's see whether we can find a way in here to try and get something stolen away s shove going wide unug in position
2:12:10
like this could be a difficult Baron as sponge decides to turn it he is able to
2:12:16
lock that one down hok gets in there but doesn't get away with it
2:12:21
and that is Rich locking down that kill they do manage to take down the Wukong with the knock up but just gigantic they
2:12:27
take down andil but hype is still in so much trouble lazy field wants to flash in and he will do
2:12:39
so uh in the lck and he's got the talent to do it now Canyon is going to get isolated here
2:12:45
once again the V Al does come in but look at that huge Redemption heal and they just don't have the damage
2:12:51
they're finally going to get onto that backline but then giant rocket is going to hit DEA as well but he is going in so
2:12:57
Viper that's a couple of kills
2:13:06
down the coming in and now you've got a front line for ruler to just go
2:13:13
absolutely insane in this fight oh he's looking for peanut actually he's got it maybe one rocket no
2:13:20
not quite but he will absolutely take at least a triple kill in this
2:13:29
one as the big one does rain down are they going to be able to get in here Sher just running forward there's the
2:13:35
face breaker it is going to be loer the locks down the dragon but can they win the fight that's the question blash out
2:13:40
here from shower superplex to get life out of the fight very very low there's the double s BL to gets the watch out he
2:13:47
and they do need to watch out Dudu trying to fight three but he's The Flash
2:13:55
away and berserker's under the turret but I don't know whether that safety is there it is the queue comes through
2:14:01
watch out him yet again as L to get the triple
2:14:13

[Music]
2:15:47
hello and welcome back to the space we're here after game number two that bnk was able to take away from DX and
2:15:53
tie up the series one to one and that game very chaotic I would say it was a
2:15:59
bit all over the place bnk did get the win I think Diablo was playing his hard out the rest of the team trying their
2:16:05
best they got across the line eventually anyway guys thoughts on that game yeah it felt like you know they won but there
2:16:12
was definitely some some sort of flow going in the direction a little bit I
2:16:17
don't know how else to describe it definitely felt like there was some push in the other direction maybe for themselves you know maybe didn't believe
2:16:24
in themselves but they got there in the end I think in general they had really good game plan but yeah as you mentioned
2:16:29
it was kind of messy like macros at the game but I think it was still fine in
2:16:35
the game so we are having a game SC now we did expect a close series that first game from DRX was pretty strong so we
2:16:41
were thinking hey maybe DRX are just going to close it out but that is not what happened because Diablo he found a
2:16:47
lot of moments to really pop off in this game yeah I feel like this one is just as simple as you're level four and the
2:16:53
animated carry is level two so a bit of a mistake honestly from from DX to go for this one but daab just super
2:16:59
confident and knows the limits of his Champion which uh it looks like the other side didn't in that moment yeah
2:17:05
and also we could see some kind of not clean cleanest dive we ever seen in lck
2:17:11
but I think uh as vdus mentioned that Dia was the only one player who actually
2:17:16
focused until the end so that's why even though the DI was not great that's all like they still picked up the two kills
2:17:24
yeah I mean at the end of the day you could see he was on like a sliver of Health but still he was able to get a couple of kills and that could have just
2:17:30
been them all diving two people dying and then he's just running away that could have definitely gone a different
2:17:36
way so shout out to diabl for holding on and then we had this oton fight as well
2:17:42
yeah I mean ends are pretty Scrappy uh the Z is trying to get value with the ult from a distance but unfortunately just none enough damage coming down and
2:17:48
the attan gets secured and it's just running away at that point it feels like they just didn't have a great scenario
2:17:54
to land like a big MF F or get a lot of value from the carries here yeah I really like their formation basically
2:18:00
they're just playing for front to back so that's why Varys and azir had really great uh potential in the game and also
2:18:07
the team their team competition is all about just them having a great damage zaler in the backline so I think that
2:18:13
was really great game playing by bfx yeah definitely was it uh it wasn't all clean as we mentioned a couple of times
2:18:20
but uh specifically we did want to hone in on one moment that uh didn't go
2:18:25
exactly right for bnk and maybe where they can clean something up for game three yeah you can zoom out here and see
2:18:31
the what's going on on the map basically uh it's actually a minute before the Drake and also your Elis is going Top
2:18:39
Lane to get the top side vision and your 8 carry randomly just running to the B Lane without any vision control he got
2:18:45
Vision briefly off uh andle there but he was looking bot Lane and just just faced
2:18:50
checks completely on his own his supports on the other side of the map and it's disconnect like this that I
2:18:56
think really plagues our team so low standings not working as a unit I think is a lot of these team biggest issue and
2:19:02
that's a prime example that although it didn't cost them the game it did make it a lot harder yeah uh it can be really
2:19:07
great tip for the solo Cube players as well like whenever you have to get vision control you have to think about
2:19:13
objectives what objective you want to play around is just you can just press a
2:19:18
tap and see the timer if the Drake is a minute before then you have to go to the Drake side and then set up the vision
2:19:25
control and then you reset and get the get more WS when they're clearing the wars and then you have new WS when they
2:19:31
have LS on cool down so it's basically uh the how the league works and I think
2:19:37
they really need to clean this up because it's going to be really hard to get the another win if they make this
2:19:43
kind of mistakes over and over again yes a very simple breakdown there uh absolutely on how to uh clear out vision
2:19:51
and make sure that the enemy doesn't have Vision but it's really important you know I I think that's a good point from whated to just say uh even our pro
2:19:58
teams struggle with it at times even our best players struggle with it at times and DX will be moving over to the blue
2:20:04
side for game three I think their draft we didn't really talk about it too much but I really wasn't a fan of the zerth and the MF like especially the MF we've
2:20:11
seen a lot really hasn't found a lot of success here yeah I mean I'd say D+ is one of our strongest teams at the moment
2:20:17
and they couldn't make the zerth work uh I I don't really I mean I understand the value I understand the pick I know that
2:20:23
the match up in the a Zer is good but I think it needs a lot to make it work and also I think you're too conditional especially with like a zerth and an MF
2:20:30
cuz a lot of MF value comes from the old a lot of zerth value also comes from that Old if you don't have the right
2:20:35
setup for it or even if you do sometimes you might only get like one Target and that might not be enough you have to set
2:20:40
up perfectly if you want to play MF and I strongly believe that they still have a language barrier between their ad
2:20:46
carry and the team so I think they need to make it simply make it simple we'll see if it
2:20:51
works for them in game three cuz they're going to have to play from the red side we'll see if Diablo can do a bit more
2:20:57
carrying but guys let's go back to the casters for that game number three thank you very much guys uh great to see the
2:21:03
breakdown and yes um a little bit more tidying up is going to be required for b
2:21:09
k but DRX I want to Echo the sentiment as far as a messy draft I I think that
2:21:15
we do need to see better out of them as well because we want to see teams on a little bit more of that even
2:21:21
coming out of the gate and I feel like they kind of shot themselves in the even footing um in that second one certainly
2:21:28
having blue side is a huge Boon um going into game three with already 20 Champions removed before the first ban
2:21:35
phase hits so we'll see what flexibility DRX can show here such an important win
2:21:42
for both teams for DRX it puts him in a really nice spot in the winning group right they'll go up to 3-1 and plus one
2:21:47
if they win this game for B and K aot puts them at 04 almost certainly
2:21:52
eliminating them from playin contention at -5 the closest team to them in terms of game score is ne2 for dnf so you
2:22:01
really need to close this series out if you're BK otherwise we'll see you in lck yeah that's that's just a long and short
2:22:08
of it unfortunately let's do it let's jump into game three here got the draft ready for you as DRX now have that I
2:22:16
guess air quotes advantage of the blue side but when it is the third game there is so much that's been removed there is
2:22:23
so much navigation required of this draft that uh it can go either way I
2:22:29
think that it is definitely a whole lot more chaotic and I'm looking forward to it zyro once again going to be banned away as well as the scanner kalista you
2:22:36
know Cante things like this are big ones as there goes the Gallo as well first time we've actually seen the gargoyle so
2:22:42
that's going to be the adaptation moving into this game I think really fishing for an aurora first pick here potentially with that Gallo ban well the
2:22:48
best uh answering champion to both the rumble actually and the Aurora um and can be played either mid or top just
2:22:55
like the Aurora can be so I think that's what they're kind of saying here that Cante gets banned with the scarner and I
2:23:01
think likely we'll see that third ban U be the Aurora instead of the ash here on red side for BN K but we'll see they
2:23:08
leave it open I think it's a huge opportunity here for DRX kalista's taken away so now you got to choose between
2:23:14
you know Ash or Aurora and either of those options seem
2:23:19
pretty frightening to me but I do believe that DX probably want to get lazy F on something a little bit more powerful this time around because last
2:23:26
game just wasn't it for the young man and I think diao is going to have a big
2:23:32
Target on his back this time around so what is it going to be the Aurora or the
2:23:37
ash that is the question yon instead is going to be taken away here yeah exactly I feel a lot more confident if I'm being
2:23:43
K with Diablo playing the ash if we give the Aurora and hoping to play through that wi con um so maybe that's the idea
2:23:50
here and instead of like you know you get a little bit neuter they'll take the rumble instead though with the gante ban
2:23:57
didn't notice that this big pick was still left up yeah oh no BK Dar come on
2:24:02
guys now they have a chance I mean the KR side you could hear the groans as well via's laughing so maybe clear's
2:24:08
laughing and that's why they're hovering it um but look listen have something the chance to to make history and with the
2:24:14
first Corky win in LSK Cup history and also get their first win stop it stop it
2:24:19
stop hovering clear you're a monst no okay okay well who's P then for this
2:24:27
series wolf um cuz I I don't think we play the game I don't think it's it's it's a formality we don't need to deal
2:24:32
with it's starting to look like UK but let's you know let's play it out a little bit I think
2:24:38
look yeah I know isn't it sad well is powerful yon is banned and Jax is
2:24:45
unavailable um we're still locking the S now there's a lot of single tar
2:24:50
uh followup CC still available in this draft but like most of it is gone to be honest uh so it's kind of just with the
2:24:57
jungle pools thinned out Raptor feeling comfortable this pick is what it's looking like here with why they lock that one in um can work well with Rumble
2:25:04
to and uh not because like his overheat his autos and the permafrost there I just mean like if you lock somebody down
2:25:09
with the glaz prison he puts an equal on it's pretty good um slowing them all as well Shield is so no-brainer here God so
2:25:17
wait Rumble Ash Braum yes oh God yeah well we kind of saw this one coming
2:25:23
didn't we uh no but at least b k got Cy you know you you're not like trading
2:25:28
it for nothing W don't be silly hope now I hope that cork is going in the mid lane but it also that also really hurts
2:25:36
via's opportunity to be kind of the carry guy for this team cuz he has had some I mean via has had experience
2:25:42
losing on corki so far he has he's one of the mid losers yeah he is um let's
2:25:47
see we're going to find that's not a single himount everyone has lost on guys this is uh going to everyone okay this going mid I'm very happy to see diablon
2:25:55
are as well it's been one of his better picks and Challengers uh so you know
2:26:00
they can set up a lot of different cool bottom Lanes with this that can help counteract the Braum I think Lulu is a
2:26:07
definite consideration here Yumi you know Kell's played the past that one's probably not my favorite option but it
2:26:12
is an option in this game it still exists see where they do decide to go
2:26:17
now with some band coming through bnk probably wanting to take away some mid lane options that Aurora is still up and
2:26:23
available yeah less uh of a big concern I think in this draft because they have the rumble already but it it does work
2:26:30
well as rum it's a lot of magic damage but we'll see I think it's definitely one that they should consider Le ban the nocturn first if they had nocturn and
2:26:37
Aurora to close this Aurora Rumble Ash Brom oh my God Lulu is banned so that's
2:26:43
wise I I thought that was probably the biggest thing Kell was looking at at this draft Yeah I think Lulu rata a
2:26:49
probably good band just the rata because K is so comfortable on it and the bailout is just so powerful in this so I
2:26:56
I do agree that's likely where we'll go we have seen you know sometimes zeri
2:27:02
goes with like a Leona but that's banned uh in Fearless so I I don't think that's really something that you want to think
2:27:08
about apam man ban yeah that I mean it kind of makes sense uh with like the
2:27:15
explosive poal exactly Bard I would
2:27:21
preferred yeah I I mean rata is still pretty good here I think since it's left
2:27:26
open I mean zerry doesn't need your magical journey she has a button that does that anyway I wonder if they'll be
2:27:32
so B okay this oh God they doing it I was alluding to oh my God it is one of the best picks
2:27:39
to be honest I think that's available for the Z next to the ranata and they are going to opt into it now Kell is a great rata player great into the draft
2:27:46
of DRX I know what we need we need jungle Brom Ash mid and then Lucian Nami
2:27:52
to bring it back the Lucian Nami Zer Zer Yumi it's going to be so good now I
2:27:57
don't think this has a lot of synergy with uh the rumble pick in particular I think m y is definitely I think is
2:28:03
probably the way yeah that's probably the good one Bunch they were having some fun there with some of those uh Hobbs
2:28:08
was definitely good oh wait wait wait
2:28:15
where is it going um where is everything going I mean who am I normally Le would
2:28:20
be going top in a situation like this but where does where does the rumble go then is it is it he mid Rumble um now
2:28:28
this feels like an angle for a kenon potentially for me um for clear the Aurora top though does make sense too
2:28:35
and you know it helps Zone this very squishy composition very well and now
2:28:40
Ash in the bottom Lane you know you can't you can't have like Braum go
2:28:45
anywhere but support like that's that's guaranteed that one was confirmed matter anymore Le in into corki makes
2:28:52
corki seem really strong here actually um and now if it's top corki and he ends up Le at the top here instead that could
2:29:01
work out but they're not going to opt for it so it is just going to be lent into
2:29:07
Aurora well I I'm I'm all about it are you I'm not really about it myself
2:29:13
actually I reckon it's a sign that ucal is feeling himself you know and you'll
2:29:18
love to see it uh I'm hoping that he was feeling himself on zerth you know in the draft and uh and he played well he did
2:29:24
play well but you know it didn't work in the end did it uh no I I think things went wrong around him a little bit in
2:29:30
that game however I do want to say that I'm not trying to defend a zerth pick otherwise Valdez is going to get very
2:29:36
upset with I'm going to get upset with you but not as upset as Valdez yeah he would get way more upset um
2:29:41
I look we in League of Legends and in Fearless I'm all about like oh we got the unusual thing that's really awesome
2:29:48
I want to Champion it like like that's that's what like the whole point of this is is we're supposed to see more flexibility out of players I don't think
2:29:55
this one hits for me though to be honest I'm going to I'm going to say I think this is high risk Now High reward I mean there's some really great setup here the
2:30:01
sleeps you know arrows into equalizers the level one is incredibly powerful
2:30:06
this comp scales though this comp is real and I I feel like B and K have a great opportunity to get their first win
2:30:12
I don't think so they've got COI I don't think it's just going sorry wolf let's jump onto the rift of game three
2:30:19
[Music]
2:30:30
all right I'm sorry for the dampener but uh sometimes we need like oops there goes gravity needs to happen sometimes
2:30:36
you know I want to see does Vick go first strike here like how bold is he
2:30:41
what's he looking for oh he's going for a slightly different variation on the
2:30:46
Corgi which I'm kind of into I like that um yeah I've seen a lot of comments on
2:30:52
Redd uh you know comparing the skin to the win rate and um yeah Corgi the
2:30:58
corgi's posterior and um yeah I've seen some comments about that I've seen
2:31:04
people it's been kind of one those recurring jokes every time corki loses this will be the 12th game of corki he
2:31:10
is currently zero wins 11 losses in lck Cup oh God what a oh
2:31:18
god oh no how early is it starting well I think
2:31:24
okay there's there's Vision so it is just going to be a topside start uh here for sponge on Vision here for uh bnk so
2:31:32
I thought the Via was just going to die at a minute 30 and not even like we won't even give him a chance to play the
2:31:38
game yeah and now I don't want to pretend like you know oh it's an unusual matchup maybe he won't be ready for the
2:31:43
leas in everybody Len is known by everyone so incredibly well and he has been played mid before I remember when
2:31:50
froggin was playing it back in the day when it was the cool new thing yeah I just you know it's not like Victor's
2:31:56
going to get tripped up here by the matchup or anything like that you know we do that little like Caster point we like maybe he just won't be that famili
2:32:03
no it's it's Le in um is Rascal also on the Korean broadcast today uh I thought
2:32:09
I so no was he on yesterday I think it was yesterday I don't think that's a shame he's the king of you know soul and
2:32:14
L in been a really good time to have him he was the you know KT Top Lane counter
2:32:19
to n Lon player mhm um Lon less known to be the counter to corki but everything
2:32:25
has so far technically been the counter to corki um every Champion that's been played into corki has a 100% win rate
2:32:31
against corki it's done pretty well and I do think that the Synergy between Lilia and UK is going to be strong as
2:32:38
diao taking a lot of damage will get sned up immediately has to use the cleanse and the heal as the early game
2:32:44
prowess of this particular Lane is not quite hitting um the same way the the
2:32:50
Varys and the leas did sure and and this is like why you drafted the ash Brom you know you're going to have Lane dominance
2:32:56
basically in any matchup and you know Yumi just using her health to try to mitigate some of that that power that
2:33:02
there is there and and then you know attach and try to heal his area back up try to sustain a little bit and and hope
2:33:08
that you can get through those very few uh those first few levels um where it's very difficult but it is it's just an
2:33:14
uphill battle um and Diablo is going to lose as a result a ton of farm here and this this is the first time really we've
2:33:20
seen like lazy Feld have like the ultimate Domin uh domination Lane uh where he's going to be the one who's up
2:33:26
on CS so we'll see how that uh role suits him here in the lck cup yep certainly looking real good so far as
2:33:33
sponge is going to be spotted on this Ward but is that going to be enough to actually save Dia and Kellen
2:33:39
here with that burst fire does show sponge that they know where he is okay will the q's land what are we going to
2:33:46
get as they immediately get rid of K that's a real comfortable one and they actually dropped the aggro so quickly oh
2:33:53
no now it is just Zer by herself but raptor is coming up vicker is there as well the Le's in mid and Andel is most
2:33:59
likely dead lazy field going to give up the ghost so it's a one for one in the end as sponge will find himself a
2:34:05
balling Ball but remember vler is still here so a dangerous maneuver still you just walk so much faster than your
2:34:12
opponent yilia a lot of Cs lost um for Via under the Tet here but I don't think
2:34:17
he mins too much with the how this transpired with a kill being picked up for Diablo it's not a Zer
2:34:23
moment um you know I'm not going to certify but I will pull the pen out cuz I'm getting a little bit concerned but
2:34:28
yeah um yeah this we do show this yeah we do discuss this we have mentioned
2:34:34
this this has been something that has occurred um mou so far today he could be
2:34:40
the most losing Corky player if he loses this game uh he'll pull ahead at three losses um and Kell could be the most
2:34:46
losing Yumi player as well as Diablo is going to skate his way out but uh that is you know good utilization
2:34:53
honestly of the Umi you just soak a few of these buttons and then attack Kellen is a known Yumi enjoyer was very sad
2:35:00
when she was reworked and you know basically nerfed to the ground um can't you know I think he's aware of the
2:35:06
attached cool down he just wanted them to kill him instead of diao so that diao could then play with the rest of his team here which is exactly what he does
2:35:13
he's able to secure the kill with one little extendo beam it doesn't extend but extends long enough uh to secure the
2:35:19
kill there he needs that gold desperately because you can see the Cs deficit into this ash prom Lane is
2:35:25
pretty uh palpable but you know that kill gold means that he's almost dead
2:35:30
even in in terms of gold in fact will take a slight lead here with the wave he's catching right now the Le in has a
2:35:36
CS advantage in part due to the fact that he didn't match VI Rome and we'll see how that pick continues to evolve in
2:35:43
this game cuz I'm still not really sold on it but it hasn't caused any big disasters yet nope uh
2:35:50
this is not necessarily going the best as raptor is going to come down permanently frosts Rich a little bit but
2:35:56
otherwise not too much is going to go wrong as now sponge moving on over the Lilia I think the biggest benefactor of this early game she is able to just book
2:36:03
it around the map and uh take whatever she wants just a bit stronger than the
2:36:09
the sichani right now as lazy feel and Andor just continuing to play it out here as andle will give him the door and
2:36:16
soaking a lot of these uh Winters bite procs really nicely done from Kellen but
2:36:21
still I mean they are going to be pressured away it's just how it works so that is going to be the grubs being
2:36:27
taken here all three of them for DRX as sponge just walks up avoids the prowling
2:36:32
projector which uh hasn't really been hitting so much here as Raptor puts the dragon at one Health and then just
2:36:38
swings his flail around that is plates going over though as DRX almost able to
2:36:43
get two them yeah they can if you that's so much money yeah I mean if you can Lane swap with Zer into this match up
2:36:49
you to do it every time but they're you know unfortunately not able to escape uh the ash in this case as they match the
2:36:56
lane Swap and so he's just having a real rough time up here now in defense of the Zer pick for Dia it's a pi he's known
2:37:02
for May cter curse him or bless him oh yeah Kell actually able to block that Winter's bite really nicely but the door
2:37:09
is a great answer that bowling ball sponge is level six only needs one Auto and holds it wow that
2:37:16
restraint as okay sponge's going to be able to to steal away this Camp I don't know why we're running back because this
2:37:23
is uh still a scary dive opportunity and the longer they stay here uh you know
2:37:29
the more is lost so I guess the idea is let's just keep you know Dia at Bay here
2:37:35
trying to take away as much Farm as possible but not going to end up committing any further as raptor is
2:37:40
coming yeah immediate cleanse it's really really nice in comes clear though as andil not going to be able to stand
2:37:46
beside lazy F early enough I don't think as there's the Flash Forward explodes and takes down the ashes there's the
2:37:52
bowling ball and we're getting a bit tired watch out e is not even necessary
2:37:57
as sponge is running at Mark 10 looking for clear and for Kell Winter's bite
2:38:04
will connect beautifully and there's the spin it's going to be a triple most likely as ucal I think is going to be
2:38:09
gifted this one walks over just needs a tempest does have to flash as uh was a lot of wandering here for the Le in but
2:38:16
now he's online as well okay um wild and wacky game here they got a lot
2:38:23
of gold into Diablo's pocket off of the play but unfortunately lost more than
2:38:28
that and how we have to quantify this I mean look he has cleans he wants to go in for this play I thought it was Raptor
2:38:34
was showing up by the way misspoke it was clear cuz I saw a glimpse of somebody was appearing there it was of course the Aurora to come up here and
2:38:40
help set this up but overextending here and unfortunately the attempt to block the sleep is failed by Kell and ends up
2:38:47
being a double anyways and now the Yumi is just unlocked there now she can still reattach but with the roam coming up as
2:38:52
well from ucal this is just going to be a dead cat no matter what as he could just press E I love this he's just like
2:38:59
so funny Miss this one takes three turret shots and has to flash yeah but
2:39:04
worth yeah still gets the money I've been trying to make this point about Diablo for a little while but every time
2:39:09
I try to some crazy action breaks up maybe we can finally talk about it I think Zer is the type of champion that
2:39:14
suits him he has a ton of experience on it it's a very high skill stealing type of champion where if your team gives you
2:39:20
some setup you can make some incredible plays your late game carry potential is incredibly High your damage output is
2:39:25
incredibly high and if you can get to that late game scaling moment you know your Corky gets to two items before um
2:39:31
disaster strikes and you find yourself too far behind in the game you're feeling good right now he's 150 gold up
2:39:37
on his Lane opposition the problem is that there's more than just the one matchup that we have to look at and
2:39:42
consider the fact that sponge is so accelerated on a pick that already out Farms Sani so incredibly well is going
2:39:48
to be making Big W in this game the rumble is doing fine in this one and and like somehow Lis hasn't been punished at
2:39:54
all and even got a kill early is a little bit concerning um I feel like UK is kind of just been like uh a passenger
2:40:02
so far and we'll see whether we're going to get some information as to how this lease in is going to work as the game
2:40:07
goes on yeah it's like you know it's like that one trick lease in game that accidentally filled mid and then has to
2:40:12
like play Le in and you're like oh God but he he does okay and you're like oh and he's also got a really good attitude
2:40:18
like really postive so the rest of the team sort of rallies around him yeah I can feel that except it's UK has like a
2:40:23
pretty good champion pool especially in this meta but anyway he played Le he's playing this on purpose we know that and
2:40:30
now and's going to miss the Winter's bite they do find the alul as lazy feel is very dead but can they get the rest
2:40:36
of them out of there that's the question it's a double kill that's a 4 in one Zer we might be certifying it wolf I 100% am
2:40:44
four kills now I mean that's a gold lead you can really feel yeah sponge is going to be able to walk out with at least one
2:40:49
of these so not going to be giving away a feet of strength but still this is dangerous oh God that equalizer
2:40:54
placement pretty nice is now clear trying to dance around Rich finding some angles here as vicker is almost dead but
2:41:01
he is not the main character Arrow going to connect onto Raptor and UK going to be able to follow
2:41:07
that one up really nicely sponge coming in doesn't land the Bowling Ball but it doesn't matter he's going to spin around on top of the piggy and take down
2:41:14
bristle and Sani as UK now trying to find an opportunity but not going to find too much I I still think this is
2:41:20
probably good for b k it is but DRX still have a gold lead they still have a gold lead and it's spread around uh you
2:41:27
know some of these Lanes a little better but like it it's it's really the the Lilia that's the big problem the big
2:41:32
lead and she's very squishy you know she's very easy to pick so if she's just blown up before a team fight happens
2:41:37
that could be huge but clear is the one who's in Danger first y there's the kick there's the watch out eight there as well but clear is going to survive with
2:41:43
the help of Kellen via able to take down a big shutdown on this Lily
2:41:50
and I feel like UK isn't quite getting the value that he's looking for and now he's Hing the turret when he really doesn't want to extender beam coming on
2:41:56
in there as DRX they're not going to be distracted they want to kill the Cory and they will be able to do so as Raptor
2:42:03
going to be able to grab the second dragon here at the same time yeah this
2:42:09
you know bnk really getting back into this one piece by piece with some of these small mistakes here and going in
2:42:14
like this I mean Ando kind of messes up frankly like almost all of this uh and he had such a great game one and I I
2:42:21
feel bad to slander him but that was not the ideal engage he was looking for Zer is just so mobile you know you think
2:42:26
that she's weak early but she actually skirmishes incredibly well and so you have to be respectful here this gets a
2:42:32
little bit wild because equalizer is really nice here from Rich B is incredibly low and instead of chasing
2:42:37
down kills they really just want to secure this grub and get out of here so they don't opt for the team fight and so as a result with this Arrow coming
2:42:43
through raptor is left on his Lonesome luckily for him Smite is allowed while you're stunned so he's able to at least
2:42:48
secure that that one but over here things get crazy cuz this is really Kell just being Yumi and pressing a shield
2:42:55
button and you know B saying well you know corki shred is pretty strong in the early game and uh as a result they do
2:43:00
end up getting a shut down on that corki via is you know still going to ultimately perish but uh no it does end
2:43:08
up being a big swing of gold over to BN K with that shut down onto the Lilia still massively ahead over Raptor but
2:43:15
you know in terms of what these Champions do the Sani is okay being a little bit bit low Eco it's the zeri
2:43:20
that's very quickly becoming a problem and it's diablo who's been the big carry player who's had the best mechanical performances for this team so far this
2:43:27
season of uh lck cup so if he is given the tools to pop off he just might and
2:43:33
this game is suddenly a lot more interesting oh well Dia's going in they do find the final chapter as well as
2:43:38
andle gives them the door that is going to say no to any more aggression diao still thrown a bunch of these uh zaps
2:43:44
into him but and it will be fine now sponge on this Lily
2:43:50
spot Raptor moving up lazy to get a crab did have to flash there so another big
2:43:56
follow-up opportunity doesn't have cleanse cuz he opted for the the lane barrier to have more Lane dominance
2:44:01
there into the Zer Yumi so that means if he's caught by Raptor's ult for example with no flash that is a big angle to
2:44:08
just crush a team fight cuz UK remember he's he's not playing a mage like if that Ash is down and and Lilia is not in
2:44:14
position to do damage the damage just falls off like a a cliff um for DRX once lazy field die so that's a very valuable
2:44:20
flash really is and I think that like a large reason why I think the the lein is
2:44:26
going to be valuable here is he can actually lock down this Zer right like kick flash can put the Zer in a position
2:44:33
where she's unable to you know use all of that Mobility right because there's so much AOE on DRX and if they do get
2:44:40
her uh in range then she dies very very quickly just have to see whether UK can
2:44:46
execute it yeah I mean he can follow aeri to if he hits a you know sonic wave then he slides over the wall he's like
2:44:52
well I'm still with you I'm fallowing you right over so his Mobility is incredibly useful I do agree and he went
2:44:58
stride breaker so I mean that's definitely the game plan here just have to see how it's going to work as DRX
2:45:04
just holding onto the midwave sponge clearing out wave after wave and lazy field going to come down and collect
2:45:10
this red buff that is has been prepared earlier and look it's still a 2.5k gold lead
2:45:16
like it's it's decent uh DRX have also being able to grab the Feats of Strength as well as that first turret went down
2:45:22
on that top side and ucal in a side lane is going to be frightening right yeah no
2:45:27
absolutely and it's hard to to get away from him if he's able to sonic wave you because then he gets on top of you and
2:45:34
and slows you and you have to time your Valkyrie really well as Vicki you're the one who's s side Ling into him which was
2:45:40
the case until you walked away from it but will continue to be the lane assignment for now Herald's up in 10
2:45:45
seconds here still no flash on lazy feel and so they have to play this very carefully I think the engage and the
2:45:52
setup here for sponge with flash available is going to be huge he's sitting on two items he's got his Rift maker online uh he's really the biggest
2:45:59
one on the rift right now just in general it's all or nothing for him if he gets caught or if he's not able to
2:46:04
set up that engage then team fights won't happen the way that DRX uh would like them to bnk with a late contest
2:46:11
here trying to to kind of pinch sponge and pull him off if they're able to steal this could be a big deal although
2:46:17
uh I don't know whether sponge is too worried pulling Shelly out at this point in time Rich going to be moving over
2:46:24
that teleport is going to be invested clear holding on to his for the moment immediate cleanse there from dible will make Captain Jack happy but you count he
2:46:31
just comes over that's going to help secure this Rift Herald and clear now with some time in the bottom Lane might
2:46:37
be able to get something done as well as Andel on lazy field moving back over door value is Big that was that is going
2:46:43
to save the turret great way to set up on that objective by bnk knowing that sponge has to be the one to start it but
2:46:49
he's not a tank he's very vulnerable and he's also kind of the engag tool so kind of force a fight there where Rich has to
2:46:55
TP in and then grab a bottom side turret cuz winning the fight was going to be pretty tricky but trying to apply that pressure and just kind of saying ah we
2:47:01
get a turret out of this that's what you're going to get with the rift Herald anyways if they get mid turret you know that's more valuable than the bottom
2:47:07
turret the outer there that bnk get but still I feel like taking a pretty risky situation and turning it into an optimal
2:47:13
one very carefully there very measured from bnk the kind of plays we aren't always seeing from them in these really critical Ive fights now they have more
2:47:20
control over the bottom side where the dragon is spawning infernal Drake it's infernal Soul would be sole point for them pretty massive they have time to
2:47:27
reset here really well played for bnk remember there Zary is scaling incredibly well she's not there yet even though she has four kills and did
2:47:33
finally take a CS lead doesn't have that second item just yet close to it is going to back and get it this fight is
2:47:38
maybe the first time where bnk actually just kind of stand up and say we're ready to actually go toe and toe with
2:47:43
this team doesn't have a robust front line little bit late to the party though is Diablo he does have his runin but he
2:47:49
needs to get here very very fast yep just went back and got that hurricane as clear is on a really long flank I just
2:47:56
don't know whether he's going to even possibly get here in time yeah they just going to trade for the turret Raptor was thinking about a possible steal
2:48:03
opportunity and they're not even going to be able to get any meaningful damage onto this mid lane OU of turret as well
2:48:08
UK turns up he going to try and push clear away and sun sky almost done here for UK
2:48:14
as well by the looks of things so the leas in going to be able uh really Jewel
2:48:21
my biggest concern is that there's so many eggs in it's to be fair it's in two baskets but two fairly vulnerable
2:48:27
baskets and lazy fing sponge here for DRX o vler diving forward Shelly gets amongst it and Kell bopping blocking and
2:48:35
that's still charge so nicely done but no turret so you know traded a Herald for a turret and no Herald turet secured
2:48:44
by DRX means bnk trading up on this one the gold lead still there for DRX but
2:48:50
again all of it on Lilia and if she's caught can't set the engage there's just not a front line here there's not a tank
2:48:55
like they have to win fights almost instantly and then Ash can clean up by you know winning a 5v4 she still does a
2:49:01
lot of damage but going to have to get on top of Dia he's going to have cleanse back up here momentarily lazy field does
2:49:06
not have that Summoner so his flash is always so valuable it's a really close game here it is thing that I'm worried
2:49:13
about uh for bnk is the fact that sponge has a twole lead he's ahead by like 12
2:49:18
camps or something absurd like that still doesn't have boots too yet and so the Feats of Strength value not quite
2:49:25
there and once he moves to strength of feet as it were uh this guy is going to
2:49:31
be an absolute monster you can see already has the most gold in the game little bit uh little bit more than dible
2:49:36
who is the next thing that everyone needs to be worried about in this game it's very clear who the protagonists are
2:49:41
on both sides absolutely and I I think with Lucid showcase and you know we'll probably might even have it during the
2:49:47
break of the Mad movie um you know what he showcased in kind of a closer game um
2:49:52
a significantly closer game on Lilia uh you know you can see what it could do when you're you're just doing okay in a
2:49:58
game that was when he really got the kills and popped off in in his particular D+ game from this far ahead
2:50:04
you have so much Agency on the Lilia and he may even be able just opt into an early armu guard here with some of that additional gold he actually has picked
2:50:10
up he did buy the Merk Treads now does have his upgraded boots uh you were talking about just moments before he can get an armu guard uh before this next
2:50:16
dragon not sure if he'll be able to afford it but if he can that would be so huge for him cuz he has really all the power like you said he is the the main
2:50:23
character here for DRX and how this next fight goes may just be what kind of
2:50:28
Really T tips the scales in One Direction in this game and Valdez has been doing such a great job every time we get host uh Val is he always does
2:50:36
like a little summary of how the game went right before we introduces his Coast I don't think clean will be a word
2:50:41
he uses to describe this game for sure but uh it it has been interesting and
2:50:47
we're about to really I think find out where the script writers are going with it yeah St actually completed here for
2:50:53
you out a little bit more team fighting Power for the Le in really wants to be able to get into that back line to kick
2:51:00
aeri that's what he needs to do we see whether he can actually nail it as lazy
2:51:05
field holding onto the wave going to be able to keep that mid outter turret alive wave shoved in here on the top
2:51:11
side of the map though does give DRX some space moving over towards adakan which is the currently focused uh
2:51:17
objective andle moving in does need to be careful wng but with sponge in the area he is the best bodyguard that this
2:51:24
guy could ever hope for it's so tense remember the stakes people watching at
2:51:29
home bnk need this win so desperately you know this is basically their their tournament life on the line yeah and now
2:51:37
I mean it's all resting on this very young player's shoulders as well dible is fresh into the lck this season he's
2:51:45
been playing with BK for his entire career right he was sort of their their new prospect that they were leveling up
2:51:52
in Challenger and now UK's rotating over he's going to get immediately collapsed
2:51:57
on by Raptor but not going to get stunned up or anything like that until now as the glacial prison comes in but
2:52:04
going to last for very long at all does have that tenacity I'm pretty sure yeah one more minute until that Dragon spawns
2:52:12
no he doesn't okay just uh oh I thought you were talking about uh sponge no yeah yeah no I was talking about UK just did
2:52:18
didn't seem to worry too much about the glacier prison whatsoever he will have them soon but he doesn't have them for this dragon fight uh and also two ampts
2:52:25
picked up for sponge does not have enough money for the really expensive arm guard you know he has a huge lead
2:52:30
but it's still not enough to price that item in to this team fight which is going to be I think the first step to
2:52:37
whichever one of these teams is going to take Victory here depending on how this all shakes out diao also backing once again right before this critical
2:52:42
objective picks up a BF sword so that's a lot of additional stats for him in this fight keep talking about these two
2:52:47
players spe specifically because they hold so much power oh yeah o UK looking
2:52:53
for an opportunity here is oh clear that is not the face check you wanted not able to get to the wall in time and that
2:52:59
is just a barbecued Aurora lazy field now fighting vicker and he's got andle
2:53:04
there in front of him the door makes the corki completely worthless and they just
2:53:10
get away with that pick on the top laner 30 seconds until CLE can teleport back into a potential fight now I mean
2:53:16
Diablo's really doing a great job of zoning La feel out he's at half health so DRX not able to necessarily
2:53:22
comfortably take this Dragon at that time but I mean if this Lilia was less fed maybe she wouldn't be able to do it they're just going to give it up though
2:53:27
VI is not going to TP into a fight and it's they they're on a two Drake lead but I think they really needed to hit
2:53:33
this timing window specifically and this is kind of what w did's been alluding to what we' been talking about this team just I mean where like why face check
2:53:40
that trip rush anyways your your ad carry is miles away and this fight is so
2:53:46
important everything else was so well set up trying to come in and set up for this fight just like the last one they were very late remember they they had
2:53:52
the the two item for diao but he's not able to get the dragon fight in time this time clears way out in no man's line gets picked they get to have that
2:53:58
said Team fight and bnk dropping the ball in terms of shot calling once again
2:54:04
and thinking too far ahead I think is what it was for Clear like trying to get into a good flanking position thinking
2:54:10
that they have a monopoly on the vision and there was no ward in there but unfortunately there was a rumble and so
2:54:15
rich able to get that full combo off clear just a little bit late on the reaction I think died with flash and
2:54:21
yeah he did it's uh it's just not what you want to see so diao will be able to pick up this wave very comfortably
2:54:27
static Shi and Rons will be able to do that for you I mean there there's a world where you know Rons sorry Aon
2:54:33
excuse me is uh with the Rons and Aurora ult and zeri ult um the circle area here
2:54:40
for bnk and how powerful it is if DRX try to stick on Aon just not going to happen I don't think they can actually
2:54:46
start this no way um do have two infernal dragons of extra stats um on
2:54:51
top of what's still been you know 2 to 3,000 Goldie basically this entire game need be so careful though about anybody
2:54:57
getting caught yep uh sponge is keeping up with solo laners as far as Farm is
2:55:02
concerned as well this Lilia is so big same items as Rich which is kind of
2:55:08
funny there's a lot of Burn yeah and there's a lot of bowling balls things being thrown around that you have to
2:55:16
avoid and Rich a to move down towards this bottom Lane if we would like to the certainly going to be the target here if
2:55:22
they can find him I think the best way to play this out for DRX at this point is very carefully just maintain vision
2:55:28
control you know you know the Z is scaling should a problem but don't overthink oh god oh no no no no not
2:55:33
again not again not again oh okay well he is going to be able to ult onto the wall but the bowling ball in position
2:55:39
the arrow has to be flashed this time he'll press the button but man that position from lazy field to throw that
2:55:45
arrow that was from mid lane right he had to predict I think he might play gradius he was
2:55:52
dodging everything he was playing full hell maybe he plays too I don't know but either way he's going to be able to get
2:55:57
away here these are the kind of things I'm talking about though for DRX you have pick potential if there's no vision
2:56:02
twice you've been able to punish clear even though he didn't die this time you get his flash you push him out he should have by right died there he played that
2:56:08
really well you got his ultimate too play around Vision because team fights get really hard but if you can constantly maintain the vision control
2:56:15
you have pick potential with your arrow you have the the angle of you know sponge comes from a flank angle really
2:56:20
fast he's super incredibly fast on this Lilia and and lock somebody down and win a 5v4 fight I think that's the best way
2:56:26
for DRX to play the long late game here let play around Vision don't overextend
2:56:31
look for picks instead that's kind of what they're doing here so far well UK going to get a kick onto vicka here
2:56:36
closes the Gap via just sort of standing his ground as UK may need some help there is going to be a flash out from
2:56:42
vler he thinks that he'll be able to survive the answer is no and clear that's not the teleport you wanted to go
2:56:48
for my friend that was not it not even close unfortunately clear is a really
2:56:54
choking on this one and that's Aon I think that's just it I mean zero for
2:56:59
three on this one unfortunately clear in in huge moments and they going to have teleport to come through to re reinforce
2:57:06
this I mean Dia alone I don't think can get this done in this fight yeah bowling ball moving over towards the baron here as the door is given to dible fa bit of
2:57:13
value knock up on Raptor as lazy field is just throwing as many arrows into him as possible even the big one as you gets
2:57:18
stunned up for quite some time and they just buying time right now Aon is in and now they're not really too worried about
2:57:25
dying UK with flash available but still needs to wait wait a little while for
2:57:30
that Dragon rage kick to be up and available DRX are playing this game out so well there is a zeri that's such a
2:57:36
problem they've been able to maintain vision control keep putting pressure on constantly keeping bnk recalling at the
2:57:41
worst possible times never fighting them in a 5v5 the zeri was accelerate the zeri got four kills but has done very
2:57:47
little meaning full damage in actual fights cuz DRX just not letting them have said fights and the tempo game here
2:57:53
for DRX is absolutely insane and once again they're just shut down top side making that pull onto via then I mean
2:58:00
look this is up until this moment it's kind of like okay this is a big problem VI is going to get picked but the teleport is so late like he's guaranteed
2:58:08
dead by the time you're there look at the mid lane the the ad carry your ad carry and your jungler are not even
2:58:13
close to this location so you're just teleporting into your death unfortunately in this situation
2:58:18
it was just not the right call even without the teleport to come in from Rich at the same time it would have been
2:58:24
pretty doomed as there's a kick and uh dable is able to get himself out of the way Arrow going to Sail by majestically
2:58:30
as well lazy field looking for the opportunity as via will finally turn up uh
2:58:37
what um that's a lot of big that's a lot of Burness but the rumble and the uh Lilia
2:58:45
who already has kind of some burn built in with the Le too I mean Raptor was very low but I
2:58:50
thought he kind of flashed out yeah I thought he was okay too but maybe we'll get a little closer look in the replay
2:58:56
no equalizer used by Rich in that situation either um wasn't even really there I guess uh anyway that's going to
2:59:03
be sole Point here for DRX three infernal dragons in a row for this insanely fed Lilia that is so much
2:59:09
damage um like click on her and let me see that AP yeah that's uh it's becoming a very large number Dia and Kell they're
2:59:16
going to go back home and there is an Infinity Edge on the area but we're going to have a look at this fight one more
2:59:22
time okay now let's see so Raptor does go down exceptionally low yeah Rich like
2:59:28
he's using his flame spitter Bing ball hits rich with another Harpoon double
2:59:34
Harpoon and then Raptor flashes out of the way that so that the kick isn't going to be a problem Oh the bowling B
2:59:40
oh God see that oh man sponge threading
2:59:46
the needle whether he meant it or not that's very impressive oh God that's
2:59:52
yeah 71 and two now he has he has a full Zone as he just fought now he's got a blasting one on top of it yeah he's um
2:59:59
he's got more Farm than Rich uh he's he's very rich five uh 5,000 gold ahead
3:00:04
um in fact the majority of the gold lead is just sponge what game a tragedy this
3:00:10
game ended up being for B and K just outrun on the map and this Lilia pick I
3:00:15
was questioning it the least in pick I was questioning it but they are playing to their wind cons and they're playing the tempo incredibly well now looking to
3:00:22
potentially start up a baron yeah well they definitely have we'll see whether this ruse is cunning enough yeah I'm not
3:00:28
sure about this as there's the bowling ball The Baron's going down very slowly as lazy field not going to get found by
3:00:34
the prowling projectile as diao wants an opportunity here but andle with the stand beside me is going to be
3:00:40
absolutely fine the rest of DRX all just moved back towards this Baron that wasn't releashed lazy field gets over
3:00:45
there for the DPS and they're chasing rich for some reason as the arrow is going to sail down Nails the jungler and
3:00:52
the baron just goes down and he was nowhere near but still managed to hit him uh with the arrow which is kind of
3:00:58
cute it's like you're doing your homework when you don't even really need to as the knock up on vicka comes in
3:01:04
looking for a little bit more though Final Chapter does come down there's The Equalizer trying to split up this fight my God the amount of damage is absurd
3:01:11
and the last little bit to come on through there as sponge goes golden there's some sleeps as oh no this is
3:01:19
lilia's territory now and UK he'll come on over and yes dible is pretty strong
3:01:24
but now he has no health and not a lot of opportunities as blastone will be able
3:01:30
to help him oh dear uh sponge runs a little bit quicker here than
3:01:35
dible and should be out to chaperone him so wherever he wants to go it is still hard for him to get in range especially
3:01:41
without that Q being stacked up diao Flash and the shield from the Yumi yeah
3:01:46
he's actually on the grum just to make sure that he can run as quickly as possible hey look at those little uh
3:01:52
infernal shards on the ground speed them out of there um he he lives that's the
3:01:57
end of the good news yeah uh because that has also brought enough time for Rich to take down an inhibitor turret on
3:02:03
this top side of the map he'll be able to take the inhib as well as Raptor not going to be able to defend that
3:02:09
especially with the baron so BN K lose out on a big fight they lose out on a free Baron that DRX just claim for
3:02:15
themselves and it's all because of how massively huge Bambi is this game yeah
3:02:21
oh man I'm so sad that you mentioned that cuz I I sponge is my pom yeah and
3:02:26
uh I I was my quote was going to be like I wish I I watched this version of Bambi growing
3:02:33
up you still need to do it you still need to do it yeah maybe I'll have a better quote but that's that's kind of
3:02:38
where I'm at right here Clos are trying to make heroic play but unfortunately again kind of it just isn't enough um
3:02:44
you know I don't want to say he really whiffed this one cuz he had to make something like thaten happen in this case but he's just unsuccessful again
3:02:50
this is going to be a really tough series to recover from for being AR going to connect onto di as Raptor has
3:02:56
that flank angle Final Chapter connecting as all right will they be able to survive they take down both the
3:03:03
jungler and the ad carry vicka manages to get a little bit of redemption for corki but it's not going to put a w in
3:03:10
that column unfortunately it is 0 and 12 territory we're heading to as Rich shows
3:03:16
them the flamethrower shows the scrappy shield and then just destroys cats and
3:03:22
dogs next to the base DRX going to be a to take down the inh inhibitor turret in
3:03:27
the mid lane they'll take the inhib as well and I don't think we're going to get to an infernal Soul because I don't
3:03:32
know whether the Nexus will last long enough for that one to be relevant I don't think so tragic end really here to
3:03:41
bfx BN K here in what was a very winnable series But
3:03:48
ultimately fell Too Short here we know they have it in them that's the biggest issue right equalizer making sure
3:03:55
they're all slowed up they're never going to get over to this Nexus and DRX will dispatch of bnk the Cory win rate
3:04:03
stays exactly where it is and least in mid is now 100% win rate here in the lck
3:04:10
who would who would have thought yeah I don't know whether it actually did anything really that game to be honest
3:04:16
because sponge was kind of just the main character and you can see UK yeah having a bit of a chat with sponge he's like
3:04:22
yeah man we were we were great together and they were um but it was mainly Lilia DRX is piloting of dealing with that fed
3:04:30
Zer in this game as they hit 10an on Elder which is another reason why uh you know this is bad for bnk cuz they're in
3:04:36
the group that is almost certainly losing now might be even mathematically Li I don't think so yet but we're very
3:04:41
close um the last match for bnk of their season is the last match of LSK Cup
3:04:47
against no the best they can hope for is one and four uh as they would have played all
3:04:52
five teams at that point right every uh team plays five times they need bnk or
3:04:58
sorry dnf or bro excuse me to lose all of their remaining games and uh yeah UK is that UK just
3:05:06
relaxing you know just chilling out lazy field a phenomenal game one not quite so
3:05:12
much uh the last couple of games but yeah you're right I think mathematically things are looking very rough I mean DRX
3:05:19
go up to 31 plus one which is kind of an incredible result for this group I mean they're in a a group of heavy weights
3:05:26
right I mean plus we didn't necessarily know but we knew was a strong roster but is performing incredibly well gen G is
3:05:31
in this group and you know they have KT and a re revitalized Nim in this group as well and they've done this 3-1 score
3:05:38
line without their main ad carry player with a rookie player who doesn't even fluently speak the language of his
3:05:44
teammates it's the import into Korea that we've had like it it's just
3:05:50
absolutely nuts it's it's a huge accomplishment and there's still a lot of work to be done here for DRX I think especially in terms of the drafting but
3:05:57
like I I think you as DRX you can't walk out of this group stage feeling anything but proud I think oh 100% their last
3:06:04
match is against Hond life Esports that's going to be a tough one but even if they if they lose that one I think you're you're very happy with how this
3:06:11
season of LK cup is gone 100% And I I I think that like I don't think many people put DRX like higher than sixth
3:06:18
place right in their power rankings like this is a team not expected to be one of our best and to be fair b k also not
3:06:25
necessarily up there but I think especially game one the way they piloted that game this game number two was
3:06:31
mainly just Jung jungle diff um Sponge being an absolute monster but that's impressive in its own right like this is
3:06:39
a fun team to watch and I think they're joining bro as another one of these dark horses that's going to be really fun to
3:06:45
see whether they will be able to meet some of this potential they're demonstrating to us in these early lck
3:06:50
Cup matches yeah and I think for BN K we've seen slivers of greatness out of this team remember they almost beat geni
3:06:57
in a single game they weren't to close it out they they brought uh D plus to three you know this team has has
3:07:03
basically gone to game three every time and you can see in those wins what they're capable of it's just the
3:07:09
consistency isn't there yet and I think there's a a very high ceiling that this team has that we are very far from
3:07:14
hitting so far but you're really hoping that this team can turn it around and and I think if you're a bnk fan you were
3:07:20
really hoping today was going to be the day you get that first win you feel a little bit luier about maybe your chance of getting out of the group with no
3:07:27
being the last opponent but it did not happen oh the burn is just ridiculous
3:07:33
out of out of sponge every time he hits a button they are just taking damage
3:07:38
over time what feels like forever until they're dead having a listen here lazy
3:07:43
field not feeling as great at the end of game three he game one was fantastic don't get us wrong last two a little bit
3:07:50
slower thankfully he has his sponge to pick him up when he falls down and UK
3:07:57
real psyched about his uh his first midle in of the Season UK is definitely
3:08:03
like the guy on the the like the steps of like winning he's like in fourth place in terms of impact this game with
3:08:08
6.6k damage like screaming popping champagne and like like at the top looking down like all right whatever
3:08:15
man I guess so dude yeah sure you're on our team you won yeah Jan's a world champion yeah Reckless to yep yep oh man
3:08:25
yeah but like honestly they couldn't have done it without that energy W they needed that UK absolutely deserving of
3:08:32
this and after his game one after him trying to hold on in game two as well I think we're definitely giving it to him
3:08:38
but pom in my mind it just has to go to Sponge cuz he just won game three Reon
3:08:44
they won the series yeah I don't even care about anything that happened in game one anymore more like it was a good it was a good start for for UK and for
3:08:50
andil but I UK played Le in game three and did nothing uh andil had a pretty rough game two and game three sponge I
3:08:57
mean heed as well and it was absolutely fantastic so sponge is going to pick it up brilliant performance I think his Vai
3:09:05
almost managed to save them in the last game the second game sorry as well he he he was the one who almost brought it
3:09:10
back from the brink by constantly finding picks yep there is some there is a there is a chronicler somewhere that's
3:09:16
just extraordinary proud of his boy right now uh having watched him all throughout Challenger and he's looking
3:09:22
real good here today I think finally kind of getting into the groove of the lck not feeling that pressure as much
3:09:28
and really starting to style on some of these guys so really really impressive stuff out of sponge yeah I I think DX I
3:09:35
mean I just I can't even believe like how well they played some of these games and game one actually was like sponge
3:09:40
had a great game three but game one was like really clean really clean League of Legends it it was and we saw that demonstrated like the space showed us as
3:09:47
well that level one plan UK sort of helping out there but getting that first Blood really looking good but now it is
3:09:52
time for the interview so let's throw it over and have a chat to thank you very much guys this is for
3:10:00
the Post match interv translation with the p on the side of DRX sponge
3:10:09
congratulations you guys sounded so happy right after the game but now you're very calm for the interview how
3:10:15
are you feeling right now this week we had so many important matches I'm so
3:10:20
happy to be able to get this wins and three one score lines looks amazing for
3:10:27
us indeed three wins so far although Teddy has to take a bit of
3:10:34
a break due to the medical condition the ARX was able to still perform at a great level what's the key to the recent
3:10:43
sucess uh I want to give a shout out to our coaching staff they have been doing an amazing job preparing the best D
3:10:51
possible which is a lot easier to execute with the given situation also lazy feel you know he had to be called
3:10:58
up to kind of fill in Ted's shoes but he's been doing a great job so everything combined worked really
3:11:07
well sponge your performance was amazing especially the game number one your
3:11:13
Spears was were doing so much damage and by and Lilia I think your kind of
3:11:19
decision making has leveled up so much is there any specific play that you
3:11:25
are happy the most I think game three mostly in game
3:11:30
wise I did a great job but also looking at the drafting itself I think I was I I
3:11:37
was very vocal about the situation that I have to have a lot of you know kind of proactivity in order to support the
3:11:44
laners and I think I was able to accomplish that so I'm very happy with
3:11:51
that also we had Le on the mid L which
3:11:56
we saw in the LPL recently as well so what led to the Le pick on the mid lane
3:12:04
we tried it a lot of times in the uh scripts and you call as well you know he
3:12:09
is very confident in L in Sol Lane I think list is pretty good right now
3:12:18
however Zer was getting pretty fed early on so how did you manage to the angle to
3:12:24
turn the game around one more time I mean z was indeed pretty fed but I was
3:12:29
also scaling really well so it didn't really matter much I was very confident that in the end my Lilia can also do a
3:12:36
lot of work seems like you guys are having a
3:12:41
great teamwork lazy feeli his Korean level was pretty decent as well where
3:12:46
you guys teaching him some Koreans recently I mean he picks up a lot by
3:12:53
himself and also in game terminology you be kind of give him a lot of little mini
3:13:00
lessons but still there are some words that are really difficult to understand as a foreigner but our head coach was
3:13:07
doing a lot of work in order to have him pick up those kind of new in game related words but overall he's been
3:13:14
doing a great job adapting with the uh team and I can't really tell you guys
3:13:20
what Korean I taught him because it's for it's not for the broadcast but we've been having a great time together as a
3:13:26
team next up is Honda life I know they are a very strong team but based on our
3:13:32
scream results you know our practices you know there will be a way for us to you know find the angle to get the win
3:13:38
as well so we will do our best in that match as well and this will be the end of the interview with sponge from DRX
3:13:44
and back to the space thank you
3:13:50
thank you gson as always for that amazing translation really wondering what the words that sponge taunt a lazy
3:13:57
feel were but uh not safe for the broadcast apparently always a fun time
3:14:02
very sincere words meant for friends between teammates you know so private matters Private Matter I I think that's
3:14:08
it so DX won they won in a21 fashion it it took them a while to get there we did
3:14:14
have some uh stumbling along the way there were issues once again but DX I think as the casters were saying do look
3:14:21
like a better team than perhaps we were all expecting of course this was up against bnk who are unfortunately
3:14:26
looking like one of our our weakest teams here so far in the lck so I do wonder how far DRX can get I mean we
3:14:32
have the lck cup which is a new format compared to like a normal season you have so much more time to figure things
3:14:38
out yes it's messy but DRX are keeping their hopes alive keeping their chances of well I mean because they're in the
3:14:44
group that's going to be ahead they're going to be a decent spot when I get seeding they have time to figure things out I think they don't have to be
3:14:50
worried whereas bfx on the other side BK FX time is running out um they have one
3:14:56
series left they're on zero wins they're the only team in the group with zero wins if they don't win the last series they are out I mean it was kind of an
3:15:03
unexpected from DRX side especially when we saw the roster at first uh we didn't
3:15:08
expect them to be performed good but after like few games I think we see UK
3:15:14
call back on his form and also sponge popping off I think think all these kind of like players uh being good on
3:15:20
themselves like making teams look better yeah especially as Le in just uh Immaculate uh let's take a look here at
3:15:27
the votes as we did have media going one vote for UK Cal which I think is fair
3:15:32
just because of his game one which was strong but it's not the right vote I I
3:15:38
think it's like okay whatever but he that wasn't the right I mean for me it still does make sense because in fist I
3:15:44
think it's it's still the point that you pick the lead scene and like picking a champion means you also Bann the
3:15:51
champion so I think it does still make sense in the field especially I don't think it's of a vat honestly I mean I
3:15:58
think it's obvious sponge is correct but yeah um he had the secret formula yes uh
3:16:03
I wanted you to put is mayonnaise as an instrument but this one is good too because it actually makes sense for
3:16:09
SpongeBob or sponge yeah you know and obviously everyone has seen SpongeBob
3:16:14
everyone would know the reference wouldn't they would it cuz you've watched SpongeBob haven't you but I love
3:16:20
Patrick like he's the guy he's the chill the chill guy he's original chill guy
3:16:26
he's the original chill guy he is he is so wed uh let's take a look at
3:16:32
your uh comment here yeah I just this kind of game is so messy that you have
3:16:38
to appreciate the player who is not losing their focus to end this game you know so you have to just say thank you
3:16:45
so much sponge thank you so much for ending this game thank you but it's like thank you that we don't have to go home
3:16:51
after midnight that is true also but anyways it was really clean game by ESP spawn JX
3:16:57
wolf says I wish I watched this version of Bambi when I was growing up um I I think that's actually a good comment
3:17:04
because of his Lilia performance obviously was the one that stood out but also his n was very good um I kind of
3:17:09
wanted one of you guys when I'm doing like the host to put in like you know in in the parenthesis like chronicler did
3:17:15
that one time like in a wolverine Voice or like in in a SpongeBob voice or something you know this is why you
3:17:20
wanted me to say mayonnaise as an instrument cuz you could have read it out you can do it now you can do it not do the Patrick voice now you can do it
3:17:26
mayonnaise an instrument there you go no nothing I got to do it yes even though
3:17:32
nobody made that comment uh we do have some highlights which we should get into uh but there actually are more quotes of
3:17:38
course from the Korean side as well um Sponge ate up all of bnk B fx's hopes
3:17:44
please spare mine um got to anyone anyone want to break it
3:17:51
down little bit traumatic he's like you know he's like please give me some mercy
3:17:56
he's like please you know he's scarred understandable there's a lot of a lot behind that comment I feel
3:18:02
understandable sponge I don't need any other jungler I just need you you know when we're talking about the words he
3:18:07
talk to Lazy feel they couldn't say on broadcast I feel like this is a sort of thing very sincere very sweet you know
3:18:13
Pony uh very sentimental feelings towards sponge very sweet me I think he has same feeling as me you
3:18:19
know he just like appreciate his performance you know sponge sponge
3:18:25
bro it's like some weird some weird knockoff of SpongeBob it's like sponge
3:18:30
bro is Chill guy I think it's a spongy Hong you know ah I see yeah probably
3:18:35
sponge Bops in Bops to the sandstorm wow that's actually good one like the rude
3:18:42
Sandstone is reference is he talking about the song or no the song I think it's because like the bfx is like kind
3:18:50
of sand or the team itself so it's like well that's back when they were yeah
3:18:55
yeah yeah exactly and then and then now they've come many different iterations but you know it's a call back sense I
3:19:01
think call back Bops to viewers will get that reference if you start watching lck
3:19:07
today you wouldn't understand you just wouldn't get it um let's take a look at
3:19:12
uh what happened in this game though and how DRX was actually able to uh win win it starting off with uh three kills
3:19:19
early on in the Top Lane I mean I think it's just really hard to set up with Yumi especially uh when you're playing
3:19:26
with Yumi you cannot really follow up uh the target so that's what happened after that and also uh lazy field forced out
3:19:33
the cleans before Lilia comes so it was really easy target for the Lilia yeah I think this one of these situations where
3:19:39
you have to kind of take into account who could be coming who could be on their way if you don't have the information you could have just been
3:19:45
happy with a single kill right you're playing Zer Yumi yeah getting a kill early is massive yes and they just went
3:19:52
too far just happy with the small victories you know newal didn't have a lot of damage but at least he got that
3:19:57
kill you know it was so low Health that it really didn't add on to his damage number so maybe that's part of why uh
3:20:03
that happened let's take a look though at highlight number two which was um this play in the Top Lane 20 minutes
3:20:10
later there not a lot happens in between those two yeah again uh this connection happened uh on BNF side as well because
3:20:18
you don't really need to push s Side Lane when your fourman is getting mid mid lanane prior right like corki you
3:20:25
really didn't have to push the Sid Lane uh if you waited for like 10 seconds then they could have all the control on
3:20:31
the mid lane and also they get the vision control on the river side so the side prior is kind of automatic you know
3:20:37
you don't have to do anything but I think this kind of things are missing from the lower two teams I also think
3:20:44
that this play I mean we didn't show the other ones there was a lot of time where CL was really having a rough time in this match up between top laners he
3:20:50
teleported in there to die but we saw Rich kind of just melting him so many engagements where he was just getting
3:20:55
there was that one bot Lane where he bait him into the brush and just one shot him so not the best performance having a bit of struggles into the
3:21:01
rumble yeah what I was talking about you know keeping Focus which is what sponge did well I think clear kind of did the
3:21:07
opposite unfortunately for him we know he's a good player just didn't have it here at the end of game three let's take a look though at one very cool sponge
3:21:14
highlight as he perfectly played the Lilia at the end of the game yeah uh I
3:21:20
think it was kind of flawless play uh from this series he Z at the perfect
3:21:28
timing so he stocked all the damage and then it was really clean at the end yeah dodged aeri old damage and I think as
3:21:34
much as they were ahead at this point in the game when you're playing against stuff like a Zer Yumi you can easily
3:21:40
Miss play and just lose the game like you're never safe so even though it seems like one of these players it's like oh we they're winning anyway it was
3:21:46
to secure the game and the series so why not you have the easier comp you know
3:21:51
like having Yumi you have you need to have the front line but you played top AP damage dealer as well so they're
3:21:58
making it like harder and harder uh for themselves so like I'm wondering why they're looking for this kind of team
3:22:05
com not to mention the now 0o and 12 corki um still just cannot win even
3:22:11
though it had the most damage in this entire game I believe or at least on his team was the most damage and it was
3:22:17
against al sin who did 6.6k damage which was even less than Yumi and less than
3:22:23
Sani only Brom did less damage than lein and yet still claims a victory lein mid
3:22:30
100% win rate so far in the lck cup corki zero just don't play corki mid
3:22:35
play corki on ad carry maybe you know just like LC just just just drop the pick just Dr Global ban we just dropping
3:22:42
it I'd rather see MF even at this point uh let's take a look at the standing here uh after this win as you guys were
3:22:49
alluding to bnk 0 and four if you are last place in the losing group between
3:22:55
group Baron and gr uh group eler you don't get to play in plans your lck cup is done after the group stage so bnk
3:23:02
they got a win and hope that uh D dnf and bro lose both of their matches otherwise they're out I mean it's all
3:23:08
about their own group now and I think most of the people actually expected bro to get out of the uh uh the cop but I
3:23:16
think at this point after the win against the geni I think it it it's really rough moment for bfx right now
3:23:23
yeah I mean bro had a tough schedule and they faced ah head on that geni win was massive but now it's a situation where
3:23:28
you're hoping the teams in your group continue to lose and not only lose it might it's going to come down a game score even if you get that one win for
3:23:35
BK FX so you're hoping they lose badly which uh I feel like you know we started off all the same group together we we
3:23:41
try to fight as a team every man for thems now it's not a team anymore so well maybe they should have won as a
3:23:48
team but it did not happen guys the next match one that I'm sure you are all waiting for T1 up against KT the Telecom
3:23:55
War does return here will be a fun one join us after the break

3:27:10
teport to come in from Z as Well's going to have to yeah they do get vision
3:27:16
look here the the magnet Storm from Delight into the back line is gorgeous BD tries to get out of there but Z just
3:27:22
goes all out [Music] and looks to destroy him peanut is going
3:27:28
to be the first one to go down though but now Zer oh God he's just Target Doom every time perfect lying on the floor as
3:27:35
well look at HL they are just mowing them down Z on about 100 health is still
3:27:42
going to survive [Music]
3:27:51
and that's just going to be free as meanwhile a couple of 80 carries going head tohe the barrier though available
3:27:56
and he jumps over ruler just to [Music]
3:28:15
die let's see whether he can find a way in here to try and get something stolen away SI shove going wide unug in
3:28:21
position like this could be a difficult Baron as sponge decides to turn it he is
3:28:27
able to lock that one down hok gets in there but doesn't get away with it and that is Rich locking down that
3:28:34
kill they do manage to take down the Wukong with the knock off but just gigantic they take down onil but hype is
3:28:41
still in so much trouble Ley feel wants to flash in and he will do so
3:28:52
uh in the LC and he's got the talent to do it now Canyon is going to get isolated here once again the V does come
3:28:59
in but look at that huge Redemption heal and they just don't have the damage they're finally going to get onto that
3:29:04
backline but then giant rocket is going to hit DEA as well but he is going in so is Viper that's a couple kill
3:29:19
oh the G coming in and now you've got a front line for ruler to just go
3:29:24
absolutely insane in this fight SE oh he's looking for peanut actually he's
3:29:30
got it BBE one rocket no not quite but he will absolutely take at least a
3:29:35
triple kill in this
3:29:41
one as the big one does rain down are they going to be a to get in here sh just running forward there's the face
3:29:47
breaker it is going to be loose to the locks down the dragon but can they win the fight that's the question black out here from shower superlex to get life
3:29:54
out of the fight very very low there's the double SLE L to gets the watch out he and they do need to watch out Dudu
3:30:01
trying to fight three but he still has to flash
3:30:06
away and berserker's under the turret but I don't know whether that safety is there it is the Q comes through watch
3:30:12
out him yet again as L to gets the triple
3:30:36
you say you're not afraid to
3:30:44
die but take the AR around your
3:30:50
chest what left

3:36:40
want waiting want waiting
3:36:51
[Music] welcome back ladies and gentlemen to the
3:36:56
lck cup here for 2025 and it is our very first Telecom War of the year and of
3:37:04
course things have to be thrown out the window you know there needs to be some craziness there needs to be some drama
3:37:11
that happens whenever there's a telecom warwolf and what is it this time we will will be having T1 sub gusi out really
3:37:19
for the first time since he and Teddy swapped positions back in 2021 with the Dany roster for smash their Challengers
3:37:27
player who played alongside Reckless all year last year in Challengers so really exciting to see a big change up here for
3:37:34
the roster T1 have kind of made the statement to us that they're trying to get some additional data find out what
3:37:39
the best roster is going to be moving into the lck it's an opportunity they're sitting at one in one in the weaker
3:37:45
group here in group Baron playin may be on the table for this team and they could still win of course with smash but
3:37:51
it feels like an opportunity to test something out here and T's going to take it yep and I still think that this is
3:37:57
going to be a very difficult match for KT smash is a great player in his own right and certainly a big Prospect I
3:38:03
don't think anyone was expecting it though uh Gushi has been a very stable uh member of T1 uh throughout this year
3:38:11
and the last so very very interesting but 202's first Telecom Derby improving
3:38:17
performance is key and yeah KT have been a bit up and down with how they've played certainly showed some uh glimmers
3:38:24
but uh not necessarily finding uh exactly what they want this team to look like right this is a team that's gunning
3:38:29
for top five they want to be in playoffs territory pretty deep uh to be perfectly honest so this is not quite what we want
3:38:36
to see out of KT and I think similar can be said here for T1 both of these teams sitting on one and one right now and
3:38:42
smash making his lck cup debut you so this is not the lck and it is reckless
3:38:49
approved ad carry I love to see it Reckless approved for sure so it's not his lck debut but it is his lck cup
3:38:55
debut and he is subing in for Guma again something we really haven't seen uh for the last 3 years four years um since
3:39:03
Teddy left this roster and gumma became the main ad carryer when Dany was fired right and they actually made that
3:39:08
finalized roster which has gotten legendary claim and fame has won multiple World TI World titles um smash
3:39:15
here a great ad80 carry as you said really similar play style to Gumi but also has an incredible Caitlyn as now
3:39:23
he's really really good let's see it from the man himself
3:39:29
[Music]
3:39:51
[Music]
3:39:56
[Music]
3:40:11
t [Music] really great to hear from Smash here on
3:40:18
his debut of course supported by his teammates as well um which is really
3:40:24
really fun uh coming from all the way from Challenger and by all the way from Challenger I mean like Round the Corner
3:40:29
the poke out yeah is that the real man himself yeah and I I I am I I I want to say
3:40:37
we've had T1 has had some pretty tough emergency sub situations uh throughout
3:40:43
the last few years this is not one of those situations this is a a test run for a player who has earned his right to
3:40:50
be here as well and the T1 fans have always been incredibly supportive of these Challenger players when they have
3:40:55
been suddenly thrust into the spotlight and you know there was no announcement of this until it was of course leaked by
3:41:00
the roster sheet that eventually got out to the press and stuff like that but this was a move that T1 I think had been
3:41:07
planning for a while right that's my personal conjecture but they want to give this a shot it's a really exciting
3:41:12
moment it's a really exciting opportunity for a player who I really feel has earned his right to be here and
3:41:18
it's quite unique we do not see T1 make substitutions very often unless it's an
3:41:23
emergency and we'll see what he's got today because obviously this is a different roster than the world
3:41:28
championship roster with Doran taking Z's place now we have a new ad carry player in the bottom Lane for today's
3:41:34
match at least for game one and I am just for one excited to see a little bit of a shake up with this roster that has
3:41:39
been so legendary right so well acclaimed so well known let's see what happens when there's some new changes
3:41:46
when there's some new players coming in how flexible is this T1 roster and maybe can they reach a higher ceiling that's
3:41:52
the questions we're looking to answer tonight a little bit exactly and that's what they're looking for as well like is smash just going to fit into this roster
3:41:58
a little bit better perhaps you know they've got Doran now on the top side of the map he's a very different player to that of Zas I mean that's being proven
3:42:05
as they faced off against each other because somehow Doran seems to get it together in that particular matchup um
3:42:11
so I'm looking forward to seeing it uh whether or not you know having some of that young energy as well kind of brings
3:42:17
out some added aggression perhaps from the rest of the T1 players you never know and I think like the way five
3:42:23
players work together can really change uh based on even just one uh different change up so we just have to see how it
3:42:30
does go and I think up against KT especially with their bottom Lane in the way they are this is a time to to
3:42:36
practice Doren you know playing against his former team as well I started thinking about this as a point going
3:42:42
into this he's played on so many teams atas six of the teams in this tournament
3:42:47
he's actually been on he's been performing well on them he's gone gotten incredible results on all of these teams
3:42:53
not yet on this one obviously we're still early days but the fact that Doran has played for so many teams has found
3:42:59
great success despite being memd a lot right despite being someone who's always arguably the most heavily criticized
3:43:05
player on the teams he's done so well on I think it speaks volumes to his resilience as a player a player who has
3:43:12
had such a long career found so much success has always been heavily criticized and yet still just stands up
3:43:19
and gets it done every time and you know there's there wasn't a better player to pick in terms of who was available right
3:43:25
terms of free agents when they they lost Zas but let's see what he can get done this roster I feel like T1 have made
3:43:31
some big moves some of them out of necessity right but I am really looking forward to seeing how this team grows
3:43:37
throughout this year and today we we have kind of the honor the pleasure of of having for the first time smash on
3:43:44
this LC stage and I think people will be surprised at what this guy's capable of
3:43:49
yeah this guy is really really good I'm really glad that actually he did get a lot of extra attention right playing
3:43:54
alongside Reckless means that a lot of people in the west are certainly um
3:44:00
sitting up and uh paying attention to smash Reckless had a lot of fantastic things to say about the guy and even the
3:44:06
year prior to that like smash was like even in his debut year in uh Challenger he was looking absolutely ridiculous
3:44:13
like really really good and just brings a lot of that young player energy we'll see how he does go as he matures into
3:44:20
you know that uh professional League player that does play a little bit more cerebrally as he did say he is already
3:44:25
out right like in that interview he was saying like he's aggressive but he plays with his brain actually it's exactly
3:44:31
what Berserker said and then Berserker did some crazy things in the series immediately following when I think about
3:44:36
smash I think about Caitlyn and varus more than anything else two picks that jinx as well I got Jinx on my mind when
3:44:42
I think a smash you know those are those are picks that Guma is also arguably most known for his casting is also here
3:44:48
to support his team was of course um sitting behind perfect for a really long time uh supporting wey here uh this
3:44:56
don't don't act like a second seed player oh boy um that's great don't don't mess it
3:45:03
up or I'm in there by the way yeah I really like that uh you know perfect is like they were actually like direct
3:45:09
competitors for a role for so long but he's like I'm going to Target you way you're the new new guy fantastic Kumi is
3:45:16
here looking cool common collector alongside Kera yeah so wild to see him back there it's been such a long time
3:45:22
since we've seen some of those game two Teddy drafts back in 2021 yeah and he earned his way to be the main player for
3:45:29
this roster and has now accomplished so much multiple worlds titles an incredible career before that Teddy had
3:45:35
accomplished way more than he had in terms of a claim you know even though he hadn't won the same accolades and now smash is filling big shoes here well we
3:45:43
don't know if it's going to be long term or not but I'm excited to find out what it looks like right now it might only be one game you never know but let's dive
3:45:49
into the draft here and see what happens in Game number one T1 on the blue side is theoretically an advantage as they
3:45:55
will ban away the ash kalista going to leave the rift as well and I think it makes sense for KT to Target the bottom
3:46:01
Lane just a little bit as the Yon taken away from bdd and the azir taken away
3:46:06
from Faker kind of hilarious uh seeing the azir banned Away by the team that does have bdd on it but of course when
3:46:12
they red side they want to deny it from faker as bdd versus Faker your priority is always going to be yes the sherean uh
3:46:20
Emperor is certainly a big one as ambessa also going to leave the rift interesting here the Aurora and scarner
3:46:27
I think it's going to have to be scarner uh but you're going to ban on this final spot but they did leave it to last uh
3:46:34
which can sometimes trap you a little bit cuz now you have to give the Aurora to Faker or Doran potentially I mean I'm
3:46:40
okay with seeing Aurora that one's beatable scanner is not beatable barely killable Aurora has been pretty tough to
3:46:46
beat though at the same time you know please ban the Scag I think they will oh no it's
3:46:51
Lilia oh KT oh KT what if we KT Aurora
3:46:57
by the way is sitting at a sub 50% win rate at the moment and they're not going to get the scarner obviously they're going to get the Aurora we wanted good
3:47:02
data we wanted good data on Smash and like what he's capable of we're going to get no good data at all it's a Scana
3:47:10
game oh no Cante can get locked here the question is what with it um just just
3:47:17
for context did did you hear like uh I think it was Orcs that was talking about it this morning globally sconner has died once I did not
3:47:26
know that globally that's wild it's disgusting he hasn't been played a lot to be fair cuz
3:47:32
it's banned all the time but yeah it's uh it's that's that's a pretty good stat that's a good stat um Orcs can confirm
3:47:39
that or deny it um on the space but I'm pretty sure that's what he said and it feels good to say to stat so I'm I'm
3:47:45
going to stick to it varis like I said a pick that I associate with smash um and Guma of course will be taken away here
3:47:52
so it's a nice prio grab the ashes ban the kalist is Bann so we'll see what smash ends up ultimately deciding on
3:47:58
here as Faker will get his iconic Victor they'll opt into this over the Aurora even though Aurora does have some good
3:48:04
Synergy with scarner yep and uh what comes next year is quite interesting
3:48:09
because you know you have the Cante face up here so you could just counter pick the or if you're afraid of what happens
3:48:16
to smash a champion pool you could push something up here I think an Ezreal makes some sense somewhat match range
3:48:23
keep yourself safe but instead they're looking at the Nar into Cante matchup
3:48:28
can go definitely either way Doran is a very uh practiced Nar player but so far
3:48:34
Nar is moving in the territory of a fellow yord um I know he's a little bit older than that of corki but neither of
3:48:41
them have found very much success here in the lck v is also up well that's a lot of high priority picks for KT yeah
3:48:47
it's pretty three pretty good ones uh and it's going to really shut down a lot of immobile ad cares they can ban the
3:48:53
Ezreal that you were talking about now smash has a pretty wide champion pool when you play next to Reckless you kind
3:48:59
of have to learn to do that um since he's a pretty eclectic support player himself but you know he's played like
3:49:05
ash Rumble lanes and uh they'll ban the Zia which is another safe pick into the vi so maybe it'll be a Zia plus Ezreal
3:49:12
ban here for KT rollster ultimately and now for T1 on their side looking at potentially locking down some of BD's
3:49:19
pryo picks or some support picks for this vars they need someone that can
3:49:24
kill a tank um that is that is what they absolutely need do he might be playing the lethal Tempo variety of the Varys
3:49:31
that will allow him to maybe do a damage to the the scanner Tia is pretty good at doing a damage y I think Tia was a good
3:49:37
choice uh for KT really good ban away as well because tiia VI very powerful BD a fantastic tiia that ban is
3:49:45
that's money right there yeah I almost wonder if like BD is going to be forced to play something pretty weird here cuz
3:49:51
he he really needs to play I love that ban yeah the elite support band I I feel like he needs to play something like an
3:49:58
AP carry basically um and with Victor taken away the azir is banned and the
3:50:03
tiia is gone for you know some consistent damage there and some great followup for Vai playing arri into this
3:50:09
doesn't feel great you know it's Target selection is going to be pretty tricky even though they have the vi already I mean can play it but it really leaves
3:50:16
you very vulnerable to getting outscaled if you don't Snowball the early mid game yeah I mean something like a rise almost
3:50:23
would be okay here uh just don't know what he's going to end up opting for in this kind of unique position with the
3:50:28
left scarner up yeah I hope it's not an AR pick up here because the poppy is still up and available something that
3:50:34
carrier could definitely play now this is great the ults you have to steal are amazing but it doesn't do a lot of
3:50:40
consistent damage so you really need to set up some big engages with those imates you're stealing and it works
3:50:46
great with v now they banned the Elise over the eil so the ezil ends up being a pretty no-brainer Pier especially now
3:50:51
that they have over index into the silus this I like a little bit less I mean it certainly is a lot of followup but I
3:50:57
think the poppy is so valuable still even into the silus that does want to be dashing around a lot Vault breaker can
3:51:03
be cancelled and carrier will have a lot of control of these team fights kante's
3:51:09
whole kit is kind of eliminated by this Champion uh very very powerful and I would have loved if we had have just
3:51:15
picked it right could have just locked that one away themselves instead it's going to be ker and Smash playing the
3:51:21
poppy kaisa towards the bottom side of the map don't know why I changed up the order but there we go uh we is thinking
3:51:27
about just giving him the Braum but instead I think a fair bit like a bit of engage could be helping out here trying
3:51:34
to get access to that Victor is going to be a big part of what KT rollster need
3:51:39
to do I mean they already have a lot of great tools to do that that was kind of fun I like the re here just simply
3:51:46
because you you have some combo potential with this and it also allows to set up for more of silas's old steals
3:51:53
like even if he steals the chaos storm it works well with the Real Steal the Nar ultimate works well with Real Steal the silus or steal the scarner ultimate
3:52:00
with silus uh and impale with the ra ultimate I feel like it empowers bdd in a really cool way will also gives duck a
3:52:05
pretty stable laning phase and the kaisa I'm I I think it's not a bad pick
3:52:10
necessarily but I think it's very risky there's a lot of ways to lock up a single Target you know if Nar hits
3:52:16
somebody then the gravity welds dropped on top of them Scar's impaling and smash can follow up on all that very well he
3:52:21
doesn't have the same sort of long-term damage output that I would personally be liking to see out of something like an Ezreal or maybe even a jinx yeah when
3:52:28
you have that insane front line you've got a poppy you've got a scarner uh and it is very very easy to just kind of
3:52:34
front to back behind it felt like a hyper carry composition was coming together I think you're right maybe it like feels like a copout or something
3:52:41
like that to have more of this explosive dive style champion that augments a lot more I guess damage towards the top side
3:52:47
of the map but I still think that they will be able to utilize it to get a lot done there will be a lot of magic damage
3:52:53
coming out of this team as well on uh T1 side we'll see where the smash is going to incorporate some of the ad elements
3:53:00
uh into the Kaiser that honestly we've been pretty underwhelmed with um thus far but maybe he'll surprise us on the
3:53:06
other side doam has like the whole team on his shoulders he is all of the range here for KT and he has been under the
3:53:13
most scrutiny so far for KT mainly because hype has been so good for bro
3:53:18
and KT just loaned him away um which is starting to feel a little bit silly a whole lot that we're going to find out
3:53:25
here in this game number one of the Telecom War let's get into
3:53:35
[Music] it oh man fans very loud here in l park
3:53:41
it is a full house as you would expect for the tele war and let's see who's going to be able
3:53:47
to draw first blood not only in the game uh but also as far as this match is
3:53:52
concerned getting this first game win especially for KT right they have the red side and so winning here in game one
3:53:59
would be a big statement yeah the silus into the Nar always feels like one of
3:54:04
those classic you know gotam uh moves and that was the original and it was
3:54:09
kind of one of those picks we' seen in the past where silus was so strong so many matchups and then if you picked Nar
3:54:16
and left it open it was like okay well syus is strong anyways and now also he has Nar ultimate it's a little bit more
3:54:21
balanced it feels a little bit more stable at the moment but I do think BD has a lot of great Tools in this game if
3:54:26
they can have an explosive mid game through him you know getting through the front line might not be their biggest issue as we're going to see some
3:54:33
vertical jungle potential start up here just going to pull this one away but not actually heavily committing and Doran
3:54:38
teleported to the bottom Lane as well which is uh kind of crazy was up towards the top side just to bought out whether
3:54:45
there was going to be a lane swap as B somehow thread the threaded the needle on that chain Faker is going to say I
3:54:51
have a ranged Auto attack so you're going to be in trouble wey taking a fair bit of damage here as carrier getting so much value from that Q P1 will match
3:54:59
yeah r on a winning streak yeah massive one six wins in a row pretty impressive yeah and a lot of these without I mean
3:55:05
actually most of them without Misfortune that was kind of the old combo um stopped being a jungler and was more of
3:55:10
a niche support looking really good right now um grass by the way for Faker
3:55:15
and Doran as we have engage oh crash down does come in but that is a heroic charge and a first blood for smash way
3:55:22
not sure about that one maybe he should have listened to Casting um as that is not going very
3:55:27
well and already smash off to a pretty good start grabs himself a fate of strength uh prior to 3 minutes yeah that
3:55:34
was less than ideal that is a poppy on the other side uh and you know I'm not
3:55:42
sure what else to say about it yeah I I get the idea of trying to get
3:55:47
some vars damage done early as lethal Tempo um which you you kind of expected considering the tanky front line that T1
3:55:54
does have in this game um and I like oh yeah Chain's going to connect here from beted a no electrocute since he went
3:56:01
conquer so it's not going to be the big that you're hoping for if you're a silus enjoyer when you do get those oh it's
3:56:07
gross Victor as well oh my God I think it's wise though this is weird because
3:56:12
with the way this crash down goes car just gets the free shove into the wall and that's just it yeah like he basically like just K stuck his foot out
3:56:20
and then like Ray just ran and tri overly and did we not have his Aftershock up because it looked like he
3:56:27
just popped like a balloon I'm not actually I didn't really check that yeah I I don't know maybe the space can check
3:56:33
it out uh the space could potentially check it out see what actually went down there cuz that was uh certainly not what
3:56:39
the doctor roed on the KT side of things but it certainly was on uh T1 side
3:56:44
as fake is going to be pushing on up and cuz going like feed deal with it buddy uh I know it's a rough Lane but uh
3:56:52
just try and cope as best he can the grasp is really cool cuz it just makes it super annoying for bdd like he's
3:56:57
constantly going to be trading down this Lane owner nice try yeah he's SC though so he
3:57:04
cares very little yep cuz able to come in here probably just going to hold the wave for bdd or at least make sure that
3:57:12
bdd can get something done as owner is going to have his back denied this could be a big deal as Vault
3:57:18
breaker does come in flashes in front to make sure that owner can't get out as bdd going to flash in lands the chains
3:57:24
and picks up his first kill but fake is going to immediately answer now you've got a coming over another Vault breaker
3:57:30
going to land there's the crash down but it's going to get the flash out from Faker and he will survive really see how
3:57:37
experienced cousin bdd are in this moment though to make that type of a call The Flash buffer for the vault
3:57:42
breaker is there for cu it's really well played would have felt a lot better though if it was first blood and grabbing Fe strength I almost called
3:57:49
First Blood because it felt like it should have been uh for that timing as carrier goes in gets a bit aggressive towards dock arm who can't really do
3:57:55
anything without his support up here with him yeah minus one Cannon there as well speak minus one Canon another one
3:58:02
in the mid lane yeah so this is really cool because BD has this Ward here so he can stop owners back Faker has very
3:58:07
little mana and there's no one here to really support so it's flash Vault breaker BD has the charge here as well
3:58:13
for for the uh stun or knockup I should say and Faker just comes over here and weaves that Auto in does have to expend
3:58:20
his Flash in order to escape Wait Almost able to come over here and lock him down if he's just a little bit faster there
3:58:25
it's different story oh and doran's going to solo kill perfect under the turret all right missing a little
3:58:32
context perhaps but that's good for T1 looks like a level six advantage and a little
3:58:38
bit of uh hyper proc setup to whittle him down maybe yeah and a little bit of
3:58:44
no flash and and and being I guess dead I don't know yeah I guess we'll we'll
3:58:50
check that one out in the replay yeah we will get that information for you guys I'm a bit perplexed as of right now
3:58:55
there are some pretty gaping holes in Gold around the map if you're a KT fan
3:59:01
though and this is just one of them is yeah it looks like he just whittel him down earlier hit level six off the last
3:59:06
minion and has his mear does the Unstoppable get used he just gets not
3:59:12
into the wall wallet it doesn't Crush doesn't get to Unstoppable as way out of that one huh yeah sometimes you get
3:59:19
chain CC and uh yeah all right cu's going to be looking for the first dragon perfect
3:59:28
will be able to grab one of these grubs as well so that is going to deny a fe of strength but that dragon is not going to
3:59:33
be committed to Here by t uh by uh KT man this game is kind of weird yeah
3:59:39
it's and it's not great for KT in any regard unfortunately no none of it is positive for for KT oh yeah it's kind of
3:59:45
losing everywhere um kind of the Jungle but not really cuz it's SC the Lan swap
3:59:52
uh you know answer in the Top Lane was kind of thrown to the Wind by wayy you know unfortunately just tripping over um
3:59:59
first Blood there and giving it to T1 giving it to a kaisa faker picking up a
4:00:05
kill for free had to use his flash for it but trades that it's not first blood for KT don't get anything out of it and
4:00:10
then a solo kill for Doran with a counterpick Nar for that uh R1 Cante
4:00:16
everything is coming up T's way and it may come up even more KT can't be playing too aggressively here as Doom
4:00:21
isn't going to find the ulti there's another heroic charge and way I mean he did have the uh Aftershock this time but
4:00:27
it wore off and then he died and so unfortunately the re is dead for a second time here this game du has
4:00:34
thankfully been able to hold on and farm up after he loses his Port but this is continuing to be a bit of a tale of War
4:00:41
yeah I mean it's it's kind of um they they kind of have scarner um and
4:00:47
then they have poppy who can also follow up on scarner pushing people in the wall they like to push KT into a wall that's
4:00:53
kind of what's Happening yeah perfect is still fighting Doran here the naar is in a pretty good spot and so perfect does
4:01:00
need to be a little bit careful still moving up though this time does have his all out available might actually have
4:01:06
that uh a w be a to mitigate Doran here a
4:01:12
little bit as owner is going to make his way back back continue clearing his top side camps you know you mentioned it
4:01:17
earlier that with the scarner going over um and also now with this early
4:01:22
game it feels like you're kind of not getting that data you were looking for on Smash we're getting a bit of it though cuz he's two and zero already
4:01:28
played the early game quite well well I mean kria stuned somebody in the wall and then scarner stuned somebody in the wall then car stun somebody in wall and
4:01:34
he killed him like right now goom is watching this replay like man I could do that I mean come on I think Dock's watching the game
4:01:41
saying man I could do that as he doesn't quite do that unfortunately missing the of course it was blind um smash is
4:01:48
amazing though he follow off quite well on the did he hit them with button um and uh look this is the power of scarner
4:01:55
on display Baker scaling up 20 CS up on a silus on a you know very damage
4:02:02
scaling Victor that's going to be quite difficult to deal with later on Dorne has already showcased uh his Nar bar
4:02:08
management across his career but also in this first game is pretty good so that's a pretty big Bo for team fights when you
4:02:14
can pair that with the impale and stuff like that I'm mostly concerned for T1
4:02:20
the one thing I'm worried about is what bdd can get done with the silus and his steals well there is a chaos storm available and there is the cease and
4:02:26
assist cuz not going to let him live this time and bdd is able to finish that off this his flash came off cool down
4:02:33
like 2 seconds after he uh he died there bit unfortunate I think f is going to be
4:02:39
dead with or without it I think so that's not really what I meant when I said I was concerned about BD's steals
4:02:44
but that's another example of uh how you can utilize the silus pi quite well oh CU actually going to look for it again Q
4:02:50
just barely out of range on perfect side but they get a very early flash T1 going to move over and look for this first
4:02:56
dragon though that'll be uh the first quarter of their second feed of strength
4:03:01
sandals being put together quite nicely yeah and this was utilizing their bot pryo very well um CU went top side but
4:03:08
didn't have flash or ult so not really a play to be made there grubs hadn't spawned yet anything like that so it was
4:03:14
really nice for T1 to index into their bottom side pry grab that Dragon um and now they can go over to grubs what
4:03:20
happened here before was really good wave management here by bdd pulling Faker into an uncomfortable position
4:03:26
gets him in stun range here and then it's a flash followup here by CU to get the AL bdd gets the kill pretty self
4:03:33
explanatory there really nice uh usage of the wave by bdd to set that up yep and now has his Dash Cannon completed
4:03:39
owner is up taking this uh second round of grubs we'll give them five if they're able to get all of them that's actually
4:03:45
a big deal and you can see that VI is nowhere near plus second Fe of strength yeah and that means they only need to
4:03:51
get the next objective yeah second part of the second part yeah yeah yeah the second third of the second bit of the
4:03:57
feed of strength they're going to they're going to be able to BU new shoes sandals sandals are incoming you know
4:04:03
incoming uh that is going to be five so there we go and T1 have a lot more pushing power as well as uh getting very
4:04:11
very close to having new shoes which is is pretty nice trying to set up a dive here onto Faker is going to be quite
4:04:17
challenging since his flash is back up now and he is Victor so he has that gravity field and they're not going to
4:04:23
opt into it poppy was nearby that was the wise choice although KT really needs to find some picks like that um in these
4:04:30
neutral moments in these L states that was a really cute Boomerang yeah that was very cute very annoying and uh
4:04:37
fortunately this won't be one of those fines for KT and I still think there is this is
4:04:46
not a gold lead that's that's insurmountable you know there is a lot of great ults to steal there's a lot of Team fighting Power here for KT
4:04:52
especially because as vars in a Broly composition that has a silus in the vi like this and he has gone temp he he's
4:04:59
done the right thing exactly so with this varus like he's he's set up to actually follow up really well to this
4:05:05
front line if the engages are good for bdd and so far he's had a pretty good time of it and let's see what KT can get
4:05:12
done some of these upcoming dragon fights this Herald as well where they really want to snowball this mid game they're behind they can certainly turn
4:05:18
the game around cu's going to steal away a grump that is good news his owner is coming in and he's going out impale now
4:05:25
picked up for bdd that is a that's a high value one for Faker with it speeding not wasting any time wanting to
4:05:32
make sure that that hijack is on cool down and off cool down as quickly as possible not that it actually really
4:05:37
changes it too much it's almost never going to be useful in the S Side Lane against Faker so he was like all right I have it you can't dive me you're not
4:05:44
diving me I better go for something he almost got it but uh nice try there maybe hasn't played a lot of scanner as
4:05:50
well so the ranges are a little bit uh a little bit out of whack is Dr arm going to finish his blade of the ruin King as
4:05:56
item number one on hit varis well and truly confirmed we like to see items
4:06:01
coming in first one's done for basically everyone on the side of T1 except for Carrier who does have his swifties now
4:06:07
which is certainly important uh Faker still needing to go back home but I think does have the cash money uh to collect that one
4:06:14
and the gold lead for bdd that he did have from all of those kills is not even
4:06:20
really existent anymore 20cs up is Faker and he did manage to get a kill earlier on as well so 2,000 gold Remains the
4:06:27
lead here for T1 they just have so many tools here in this uh this mid game Ona
4:06:33
can just press this button over and over again and dock he had flash guys and he
4:06:39
uses barrier and dies yeah I mean it's cool to not flash if you don't get hit
4:06:45
by anything and he thought he could but or he thought he could avoid but he unfortunately did not I think flashing
4:06:51
in this sit is dead there's an impale and we's going to have to flash he does manage to do so as at least they do
4:06:57
manage to get some damage onto carrier season assist as another crash is going to come through cuz is dead he didn't
4:07:04
ban Scag guys as all right let's see what BD can do diving towards smash here as best he can gets a Killer Instinct
4:07:10
but he's dead Way's dead fak is in there they're going to take down the turret this is a catastrophe what is going on
4:07:17
see you in game two all I can say um that was almost really cool right dock
4:07:24
almost got out without using his flash chains of corruption here as dock is looking for the 1 V one against Faker
4:07:30
death R almost kills him as the piercing Arrow does a lot of damage but not enough to kill him they almost turned
4:07:36
that fight they almost killed Faker yeah but a lot of almost stacked together a
4:07:43
being a whole lot of zero actually only counts if you can succeed and that's another turret down y they got the
4:07:49
strong shoes as well uh from that mid lane out of turret falling down then they would have got another one uh
4:07:54
because Doran is winning this side lane ridiculously hard D charges his Q he's
4:08:00
like okay I'm just out of range of this and unfortunately he's not actually um and if he was then it would have been
4:08:05
cool no flash it's great probably should have just flashed up and said okay well I lost my flash you you let him have
4:08:11
scarner it's not my fault you know no one's going to judge you that for using your flash there but not using it we
4:08:16
will judge you unfortunately then in this moment we is able to pull carer back that means he doesn't have those those key abilities for the followup
4:08:22
that KT want to go for here when bdd shows up BD doesn't use the Killer Instinct that he steals um I don't think
4:08:29
he could yeah he can't so yeah he justes dies it was kind of a bizarre decision
4:08:35
the way also lose his life for Faker has to use well he doesn't have to but he Ops to use his TP so that's like one
4:08:41
small victory and then you almost kill K him afterward stuck D but then you didn't and um and now it's a 5,000 gold
4:08:47
lead uh we are heading towards a cloud Soul as well you love to see it t one of the best at getting Cloud Souls man I
4:08:54
swear to God his team never lets me down and so they're going to be running pretty quick they're able to lock these
4:09:00
up I mean Faker has an arm guard because if he has all that extra money uh and I
4:09:07
mean that's a it's a fine Choice uh he's very safe yeah and this next Harold
4:09:13
fight I think KT feel like they have to okay this is oh dear own's coming in way
4:09:19
is going to stop him they're going to see whether they can kill D and he gets the mear don't know about the flash but it's going to do its job as we is just
4:09:26
dead once again perfect and Faker are fighting the gante doing some work here as they take down the silus owner is
4:09:33
deciding where he wants to drive and you can see up here nothing going to come of that battle Yeah KT I mean it's just not
4:09:41
working smash has perfect KDA Atlas fits right in it's looking real good as dock
4:09:50
all right line in waight wanting to get the chains of corruption he hits it on the scanner and then gets impaled and
4:09:56
now he's dead and the scanner did he notice I'm not entirely sure another heroic charge coming on through here on
4:10:02
the C decent crash down though as carrier may be falling but not before way goes down it's a double kill for
4:10:07
this scanner look I don't know whether the win rate of scanner is going to be changing but but deaths did
4:10:16
double yeah globally apparently um that's great uh they could even triple
4:10:22
um probably not actually no I don't think so not not anymore I'm saying it's possible okay um yeah this is
4:10:29
unfortunately KT like we have the numbers Advantage here but look at what's happening on the mini map we is
4:10:34
just trying to buy time cuz they know this is a lost fight it's a lost cause and smash shows up he's able to hit his
4:10:40
uh void seeker and then duck hiding like you know in the movies where there's somebody next to you goes when you're
4:10:47
supposed to hide when like the soldiers are looking for you or something he didn't have that so I guess he just decided to make sounds and appear out of
4:10:52
the brush and so he died like cuz he was he also wanted to hit dor with that Al and unfortunately the The Hop came in
4:10:58
yeah I mean he was going to die no matter what it it doesn't matter but I mean maybe he could have just gotten out
4:11:03
faster instead of waiting and then I don't know at I mean I think if he was just quiet and stood there maybe it
4:11:09
would have been okay um but it was not yeah um if you come with the King you
4:11:14
best not miss I don't I don't yeah something like that there one of those lines at this point like the game is so
4:11:20
such a forgone conclusion that like KT have to try crazy things to come back
4:11:25
and they have been uh they just haven't been working you the best thing about this is what we used to have in the lck
4:11:32
was the issue of like they forgot to ban this thing and then they continue not Banning it throughout the series at
4:11:38
least this time it is banned throughout the series and we're not going to have to worry about about the scner problem
4:11:44
again that's true but I am kind of worrying about it right now oh yeah no but I mean you
4:11:51
mentioned the the forone conclusion situation here and I'm starting to to
4:11:57
believe you as let's see maybe KT can surprise us they definitely surprise smash right there chain of corruption
4:12:03
connect and do arm going to be able to grab the kill that is a shutdown and that is a fair bit of money going into the right hands here first death ever on
4:12:10
the lck stage oh my goodness he has a finable KDA to start us off it's great to see is cuz speaking of great to see
4:12:16
actually looking for an opportunity towards his bottom side as all out going to be used Doran actually still getting a lot of work done as the Vault breaker
4:12:22
is avoided Faker teleports in perfect in a little bit of trouble chains connect though from bdd they do take down the
4:12:28
Nar and now T1 with a few on the floor this is the best way to beat scanner
4:12:34
it's fight them when the scanner isn't there that's true now they're only 6,000 gold
4:12:40
down um let's try to add some all right so like why V is such a sought
4:12:47
after incredibly High prior Champion is showcased here once again we saw it with sponge in that loss in game two earlier
4:12:53
today as well gives you so many opportunities to actually get picks when you're super far behind because he has a
4:12:59
really long engage range really easy setup CC for your team similar story here even without the ultimate to help
4:13:04
lock down Zoran win this fight T1 eyes a little bit big for their stomach on this one hoping they can turn things with
4:13:10
that Victor damage they're unable to do so and so this ends up being being a big win for KT that I didn't think that we
4:13:15
were ever going to see them get that go the go graph moving back down it's a drop in the bucket but it's still a drop
4:13:22
I mean it looks a little bit like a roller coaster so maybe KT are kind of okay with it cuz uh at that point
4:13:28
generally the roller coaster does go back down again unless it hasn't reached Zenith just yet which could be the other
4:13:36
situation Doran back towards the top side his natural habitat as voracious arakan once
4:13:43
again V's Aon really just not hitting his skill shots this season though really look at this finally carry with
4:13:50
one of them but then he didn't even get his eye in that was weird let's just say he's not getting player of the match no
4:13:55
I don't think so right now I'm kind of leaning towards owner you know if I had to be honest with you Atlas I'm probably
4:14:01
leaning towards smash because he got first blood and he couldn't do anything about the only time that he died yeah no I
4:14:09
mean he just got you just got jumped on you know just got anyone can get fir it could happen to
4:14:15
you right now exactly don't look behind you just focus on the cast I know like anyone here in lar could could just
4:14:21
cease and assist me at any point especially gon I'm I'm always actually
4:14:27
wary of it um I'm always on edge I'm I'm glad that we've now vocalized it it
4:14:32
might help me deal as gon did just tell me that I'm good at least for this game I mean it's Fearless so you won't have
4:14:37
to worry about it after this all right T1 going to utilize the rift tle to try and take down this in T by tried to take
4:14:43
down as the rift Aral is going to try and get some value because it was almost dead before Shell's charge even came
4:14:49
through carrier actually going to save Shell's life at least for a moment we so
4:14:55
far in terms of our Harold driving here at the lck I know it's so much better um
4:15:00
let's see what's the the next objective to fight for here for KT where maybe BD
4:15:05
gets it done 4 minutes until the cloud soul for T1 if they secure iton is up
4:15:13
but I think T1 have their eyes on Baron potentially you know being the thing they go for before that Dragon spawns
4:15:19
cuz it is T1 and they are kind of 6,000 gold ahead um you know give or take so I
4:15:25
think they're going to be pretty happy to do Baron on spawn cuz they do Baron on spawn sometimes when they're behind on gold they also used to do Baron when
4:15:31
it spawned at 20 minutes 25 minutes seems almost too easy yeah it's like not even it's they're like what they're
4:15:37
trying to change the code in the game to get it to come out faster uh I I look at
4:15:43
cuz has flash right if you can hold on to that before Baron I mean maybe a miracle could happen I'm I'm thinking it's like about a 0.7% chance that KT
4:15:51
wins a decisive team fight and gets themselves back in the game to get Baron and aacon somehow I mean any sort of
4:15:58
insane fight for Aon when he when you can then follow off with the baron afterwards like that's always a thing
4:16:05
that you can possibly do but there's teleport on Doran has just hit mean now yeah mear is down but I don't think
4:16:12
there's really a window where they can capitalize on that uh especially cuz cuz just back to by his Cleaver KT are
4:16:19
really not interested in starting anything themselves they are making sure that they have Vision in the areas that
4:16:25
they need it continuing to party push might be the best way for KT to get
4:16:30
kills in this game and kind of trying to surprise s laners right play around this VI but it isn't going to be a longterm
4:16:37
success story uh if that continues to happen they will eventually need to win a decisive team fight the only fight
4:16:43
they won decisively was when you know Doran overextended and T1 opted in to try to save him like they're not even
4:16:49
here for oton yeah they are trying to slowly come towards it but look at the
4:16:54
lack of vision they just can't get there it's just I mean BD does have a scrier
4:16:59
so he could potentially get some Vision over there but carrier is just playing bouncer really hard to get them into
4:17:05
this area and arakan no long for the world they do manage to scry it but is it too late and I think the answer is
4:17:10
yes because if you commit to this and it doesn't work out it's a disaster as the keep's verdict is going to be stolen
4:17:16
here by bdd and that's all they really managed to do but now the teleport is coming in Faker that is a flank angle if
4:17:24
ever I've seen one The All Out means he goes even further cuz's going to join in
4:17:29
but he goes golden he breaks the arm guard and he will be sent back home of course not really punished all that much
4:17:35
whey is likely to die here as owner is going to crash him into the wall and yeah he'll crash down but he is
4:17:41
certainly still out and KT they lose one could have been worse perhaps but uh it's still looking like
4:17:49
T1 are moving up to the right I mean Faker lost his wings but that's okay cuz
4:17:55
he just doesn't he doesn't really care he's going to come back and gods don't need wings to fly wolf oh exactly this
4:18:01
has been proven um nor do they need arm guards the jrpg Bible it already
4:18:07
explained it uh anime also agrees with jrpgs on this uh sort of sentiment but
4:18:14
it's really nice when they agree LeAndre has picked up for Faker just barely had enough money to buy that before heading
4:18:19
over to the barar that damage plus his torch will be very nice at Rushing this
4:18:24
one down now cuz still has flash he didn't use it like I said I mean maybe there's a miracle angle bdds hijack back
4:18:29
where's doran's position he's got the N maybe oh dear inter corruption is going
4:18:35
to stop owner for now they're focusing the scan and actually doing a fair bit of damage here as Doom looking to try
4:18:40
and still get these Autos in carrier Dives forward playing pretty good defense but so is perfect able to knock
4:18:47
him back KT surviving for what feels like such a long time and CE assist is still up and available smash is he going
4:18:54
to do it that killer in dives into the backline the magnet storm the immediate reaction and BD smashes him into the
4:19:00
wall it is still Aon buff that's available so T1 can pretty happily do this as carrier managing to survive for
4:19:08
way too long they take the 100 gold from him but they lose their varis and their
4:19:14
VI BD the chain lash comes in he Dodges the Boulder and the chains are not quite
4:19:19
long enough oh T1 can now move back towards the baron and get to work on it
4:19:24
it felt like a hype situation from yesterday but it wasn't because smash had outon box so now he's back he's here
4:19:30
to help assist with this Baron and cuz is dead that is going to be a guarantee on that one they've got a cloud Soul if
4:19:36
they'd like it to immediately follow up and it will be a 10,000 gold lead you know how we've had these kind of
4:19:41
Graphics come up sometimes to talk about like oh it's one the first time we seen this Champion while sometimes L give some information that the people who
4:19:48
might not be aware or like oh unending despair is is disabled right now because something going with it there should
4:19:54
probably be like something that comes up after every during the replay it's like oh by the way they they do have scarner so like ex um cuz like KT played that
4:20:03
fight really well bdd got the the Nar steel and he had like two opportunities to maybe Flash in go for the play but
4:20:09
the pup wasn't going to be there necessarily so he waits and waits and waits and when he finally uses it it's just too late unfortunately and even if
4:20:15
he gets a big one they'll have wings right like they're going to Res they're going to respawn it doesn't necessarily matter and that was their one chance
4:20:22
their one Fighting Chance and now it feels like there's just nothing left yep
4:20:27
and now they're even not able to sweep this ward in the tri Rush which is giving T1 all the information that they will ever
4:20:34
need and Keepers verdict going to miss this time around as KZ will find Faker
4:20:39
in the backline but uh then he will be found by owner as well so cuz is very dead that's going to be the first one to go down as Do's trying to get some Autos
4:20:46
in but he's just dead not a lot of opportunity to do anything The Flash doesn't quite work he wanted to get over that wall and perfect is going to acques
4:20:52
to his request and then uh that might just be all the positive news here for
4:20:58
KT as perfect will be knocked down and T1 with most of KT now on the floor they
4:21:04
should be able to walk up and finish this one off already the teleport's coming in Faker he is done with this game he really is and I think you and I
4:21:12
have been for about 15 minutes oh wait sorry 28 minutes and 17 seconds wolf
4:21:17
that's about it wait when was scarner locked in um probably about yeah 30 minutes ago something like that yeah
4:21:23
this Champion is very very strong but T1 also playing exceptionally well KT not
4:21:29
quite able to make this composition work they will throw some buttons down now but their Nexus will not be saved and T1
4:21:36
move up to one Z in the series yeah a textbook game here from owner how to
4:21:43
snowball Lanes with scarner there was some big mistakes from KT in this one
4:21:48
especially at level one unfortunately for KT's bottom Duo way going in there
4:21:55
at the worst possible time at the worst possible angle giving smash a huge lead and then scarner just runs the map after
4:22:01
that the one real good thing that happened for KT in the early game was trying to lock Faker down the mechanical
4:22:06
plays we saw from cousin bdd there but it wasn't even really that much of a trade up you know it wasn't First Blood
4:22:12
and there were so many great SS to seal but it didn't matter because KT was so behind on the tempo they were able to punish T1 in the bottom Lane that one
4:22:19
time but we've all learned you just don't give scarner to pro teams and
4:22:26
owner you know what he's known to be quite a good jungle player maybe has a few world championships under his belt
4:22:32
maybe don't let him have it I thought we learned that already the hilarious thing is for me like Doran was the biggest
4:22:39
standout in this game the solo kill onto perfect remember like we were doubting this Nar pick this is the first time
4:22:45
that it's won here in the lck cup Doran just really rolled over the top of
4:22:50
perfect there was no Lane that KT really had any options in that was that was a
4:22:56
doozy of a of a first game here but let's see whether KT can turn it around Telecom Wars often Go the Distance so
4:23:03
maybe if we don't believe in KT they're going to do a good job time for us to go to a short break when we get back the
4:23:08
space going to break it down we'll have game two [Music]
4:23:21
[Music]
4:23:43

4:23:50

J w [Music]
4:25:01
[Music]
4:25:18
teleport to come in from Z as Well's going to have to yeah they do get
4:25:24
Vision look is the magnet Storm from Delight into the backline it's gorgeous
4:25:29
BD tries to get out of there but Z just goes all out
4:25:34
and looks to destroy him peut is going to be the first one to go down though but now DEA oh God he just targets do
4:25:42
every every time perfect lying on the floor as well look at hle they are just
4:25:47
mowing them down Zeon about 100 health is still going to
4:25:54
[Music] survive and that's just going to be free
4:26:01
as meanwhile a couple of 8 carries going head Toad the barrier though available and he dumps over ruler just to die
4:26:09
[Music]
4:26:25
let's see whether we can find a way in here to try and get something stolen away seis sh going wide unug in position
4:26:31
like this could be a difficult Baron as sponge decides to turn it he is able to
4:26:36
lock that one down huk gets in there but doesn't get away with it and that is Rich locking down that
4:26:43
kill they do manage to take down the Wukong with the knock off but just gigantic they take down andil but hype
4:26:50
is still in so much trouble lazy field wants to flash in and he will do
4:26:59
so uh in the lck and he's got the talent to do it now Canyon is going to get
4:27:05
isolated here once again the V Al does come in but look at the huge Redemption heal and they just don't have the damage
4:27:11
they finally going to get onto that backline but then giant rocket is going to hit DEA as well but he is going in so
4:27:18
Viper that's a couple of kills down
4:27:27
R the coming in and now you've got a front line for ruler to just go
4:27:33
absolutely insane in this fight say oh he's looking for peanut actually he's
4:27:38
got it maybe one rocket no not quite but he will absolutely take at least a
4:27:44
triple kill in this
4:27:49
one as the big one does rain down are they going to be a to get in here Sher just running forward there's the face
4:27:56
breaker it is going to be loose to the locks down the dragon but can they win the fight that's the question black out here from showaker superlex to get life
4:28:03
out of the fight very very low there's the double sleeve blue to get the watch out he and they do need to watch out
4:28:09
Dudu trying to fight three but he's still at the
4:28:15
away and berserker's under the turret but I don't know whether that safety is there it is the que comes through watch
4:28:21
out him yet again as L to get the triple
4:28:58
back
4:29:13
great
4:29:31
[Music]
4:30:00
hello and welcome back to the space we're here after game number one of T1 up against KT with a very interesting
4:30:06
sub that everyone is talking about at the moment but the game wasn't really about that it was about T1 really just
4:30:12
taking down KT in pretty non Salon fashion and a very strong game from them
4:30:18
I'm still Valdez joined by aux and W did what do you guys think about that game one well um I feel like we have to start
4:30:26
by talking about the draft cuz there was a there was a certain issue you know what can you spot it I'll leave it to
4:30:32
you viewers Can you spot the issue there's something here you got to give them a moment like d of the
4:30:39
Explorer you got to give them a moment can you spot the issue oh oh my God that's the scunner it's scner what
4:30:46
happened I don't know what just happened yeah and you may think well they got Cante notu it's not worth it um you know
4:30:52
we actually have some stats if you're wondering is Scana just op in the lck the answer is no this is combined stats
4:30:59
including the game we just had from uh lck cup LPL and LC uh yeah 100% win rate
4:31:06
the five teams let through regret it immediately and owner was the second time it ever died in those five games so
4:31:13
uh pretty good I think the general consensus pretty good yeah I mean you
4:31:19
know T's experimenting a little bit so Kat you're like we can experiment too and let's just leave scarner up and see
4:31:25
if we can beat it the answer is absolutely not you talked about getting Cante for it the answer we saw there is
4:31:31
that it's not as good and it actually got solo killed as well by Nar which it
4:31:36
seems like Doran was very well prepared for that and of course we do want to talk about uh the little experiment that
4:31:41
is going going on on the side of T1 smash who is filling in today for Guma this guy is quite a strong player yeah
4:31:49
uh he's one of the player you might think of a ruler jackula those kind of
4:31:54
play style he's one of the aggressive ad carry uh crony mantion thanks thanks shout out to CR and yeah anyways I
4:32:02
really like to see smash uh playing in lck uh T1 has struggled on like champion
4:32:08
pool on ad carry especially when you had Guma Guma is such a great Ed carry with a playmaking Champions but he had always
4:32:15
issue with the kaisa and Zer those kind of uh hyper carry Champions but now you have smash so they instantly playing
4:32:23
kaisa which is really interesting to see that yeah a different style obviously we've seen from him you know G's been
4:32:28
phenomenal for T1 but it just shows kind of that T1 AR still invests in the young Talent you know they've had players on
4:32:34
thatr Rost who've come from their Academy system uh and seeing the Next Generation always really cool and they
4:32:39
got off to a good start some missteps I would say from wey going in very
4:32:44
aggressively on the level one loses a lot of HP loses that potion gets a little bit worse but also credit to T1
4:32:51
for punishing well I really want to be harsh on this because I feel like wey is
4:32:56
not really putting attenion and focusing enough to like use his abilities you
4:33:02
know like from level one he's just going in for no reason you know so that's why
4:33:07
they gave up free kill into kaisa which is really having a weak time in laning face yeah I mean I feel like it was one
4:33:14
of these situations where you see the rookie like let's target them but ultimately it ends up backfiring you already low HP from the level one then
4:33:21
you get slammed into the wall a bit too close there and it just big blunder yeah probably that was pretty good play by
4:33:27
Smash he was kind of walking close to the wall as well so I think maybe he uh
4:33:32
kind of forced him to use W on him as well yeah I mean re already struggles into the poppy and way just made it
4:33:39
worse and we can take a look at what happened a little bit later on in the game as well which really just accelerated the lead I think that T1 had
4:33:46
a lot of moments like this uh and we just got this one to really showcase how far ahead T1 was I mean it's not only
4:33:52
smash but also Doran solo killed uh perfect as you mention and also owner uh
4:34:00
scanner himself he just smashing all time with his ganks and those all kind of set up is really good because you
4:34:07
have kaisa in the map yeah and this didn't really feel like a game where there a lot of Team fights a lot of fight you know often that's what we like
4:34:13
to focus on but this really felt like a lot more of T1 finding numbers advantages finding pick finding
4:34:19
advantages on the map and using the tools that they've been drafted excellently yeah coma is going to say uh
4:34:26
why they use smash after this series so I'm wondering what's the issue but I
4:34:32
feel like uh bringing in uh Smash in lck for the T1 definitely means a lot for
4:34:37
them I mean they've done this many times in the past you know faker's been sub death re we've had B and blank right there's
4:34:44
always been experimentation on the side of 21 I don't think anyone needs to freak out even though it is happening a
4:34:49
little bit smashed he's playing well we'll see what else he has in the tank let's throw it back to our casters for
4:34:54
game two thank you very much Valdez for that one and uh yeah I mean an example of a
4:35:01
sub that they used to have in the jungle was Tom who is now coaching uh one making those decisions so it's uh
4:35:08
certainly not unprecedented as well I mean there are so many names closer who just had that phenomenal series uh on
4:35:15
bro is also another example of that perion back in the day poby who's in the
4:35:20
audience here although that was for different circumstan yeah I feel like recently though we haven't really seen
4:35:26
since since Teddy Guma like it's been 4 years since we've seen so some a substitution really that's like okay
4:35:32
we're we're we're experimenting like the Dany time everyone kind of considered okay that was wrong like T1 ultimately
4:35:38
decided like let's not do this let's settle on a roster and since then we haven't really seen very much movement
4:35:43
or adjustments outside of emergency subs and this is you know again if you look
4:35:48
at the extended very long uh history of SK Telecom in League of Legends yes sure
4:35:53
it's happened a lot and every team has years where they have some subs and stuff but I think it's quite a unique
4:35:59
scenario that we have here unfortunately because KT gave scarner we didn't learn too much uh just yet but hopefully in
4:36:06
game two we'll have a better draft from KT rollster maybe the Telecom war will deliver like you and I were hoping Hing
4:36:11
so much that it would before today started yep and the only reason by the way guys that uh sconner is 96% presence
4:36:18
it's because it's felis and so you then it cannot be seen in the next couple of games so it is still 100% presence
4:36:25
absolutely everywhere uh that stat was just a little bit confusing to me and then I recalled it so if you guys were also a little bit worried about it yeah
4:36:32
like this game for example no presence in this one see no presence apart from there on the top right um poking his head in reminding us all of the mistakes
4:36:38
the KT made in game number one let's see whether they can remedy them as Essa and the air we're sticking with the A's on
4:36:44
the side of KT and the Y and Ash going to be removed here on T1 side the azir
4:36:50
ban you know considering how good bdd is at it and how well he can play through CU When he has the pick I hindering more
4:36:58
than helping yeah but they don't want to first pick it so I think anything that you can't really first pick is what you
4:37:03
need to be banning on blue and the kalista going to be the final ban here makes a lot of sense Jay sneaking
4:37:09
through that will be the first pick of Flex between perfect and bdd but I expect it going to perfect bdd has so
4:37:15
many and I don't want to harp on this too much but he has so many answers to the azir like his silus he played last time when there wasn't in his year he's
4:37:21
also great at Tia uh which you know was not banned in the first Banning phase here so I find it puzzling especially
4:37:27
when you're going to be fishing for first pick Jace here which BD is very experienced on the we were kind of clamoring for before is going to get
4:37:34
locked away for smash this time around very early in the draft but Ezreal priority has been pretty high this
4:37:39
tournament in general especially in game two news where the 0 carry pool gets Whitted down a little bit so I'm not
4:37:44
surprised to see this you don't have to lock the Leona necessarily here but it's definitely the one that he's likely
4:37:50
looking to grab as his pair o n going to be coming through here for owner feels a
4:37:56
little bit like a pick away as well as CU would have liked to play that of course we saw it work out so well for
4:38:02
DRX pair alongside the Jace that was actually pilot by UK in that instance do they just lock Zyra I really hope not
4:38:09
okay I'm much more on the page with this um walking the shinou away yeah it means
4:38:15
that we might see like I wouldn't mind uhia uh on that one as oh okay doct I'm
4:38:21
just thinking about jinxing there it is okay has been known to play a very good Jinx Arcane composition everyone Bates
4:38:29
Victor's banned a well not but echo's up echo's up let's go hey BD could like
4:38:36
play that or C could play it's a flex pick there we go it's it's it's mid or jungle all right they're going to try to
4:38:44
the Leona which spoilers for the next the next one um but like Leona is uh you
4:38:52
know very strong with Ezreal obviously and can work well with Jinx help set up picks for her to get excited the rest of
4:38:57
the draft though pretty open-ended in that regard so we don't really know how this is going to turn into more of a pck uh front to back composition just yet it
4:39:04
also could be that we see bdd play the Jace and they end up getting a tank in the Top Lane like a Scion or an or or
4:39:09
something like that and that could be the way less likely with the Jax to be locked in here though for Doran yeah I don't mind Jax as far as
4:39:18
setup for Nal is concerned it's not quite the same level of CC that you can get from something like a reekon it's
4:39:24
not guaranteed yeah um but does kind of work out if they can uh start bullying perfect and perfect is not exactly
4:39:31
having the greatest day so far so we'll see whether Doran can continue that
4:39:37
still next round of bands to come in here and mid lane might be targeted jungle uh could be targeted on the other
4:39:43
side you can see the Zara already taken away from cuz just to try and eliminate some of these AP options I imagine Lilia
4:39:49
probably to uh be removed immediately afterwards that's my expectation as well cuz I think most people are thinking in
4:39:55
this draft with the Jinx here that the Jace is probably not going Top Lane into the Jacks uh Braum makes a lot of sense
4:40:02
here lot of power in the lane swap setup and uh you know just in general very strong pick right now Sani banned away
4:40:10
uh can help you set up picks for this Jinx you know yeah Sani hits then shock blast hits then Jinx hits a zap and hits
4:40:17
an ultimate and then boom she's excited she's popping off in the team fight so strong there see what the final support
4:40:23
ban is is it going to be Gallo denial uh from Faker here because I think Gallo
4:40:29
fits this uh KT draft so well and KT have now protected themselves from
4:40:34
picking Cory which is a great look for them I thought maybe from carer F would
4:40:40
be a potential angle the pantheon support has been the flavor of the month you could say it did
4:40:47
not go so well gave me a lot of Channel points though when uh did that I like
4:40:53
the pike a little bit more than the karma here the karma is safer it's so much Lane pressure as well yeah and no
4:40:59
matter what like if you the cool thing about Karma and we haven't seen that much Karma despite Lane swaps is if
4:41:05
you're laning into a top laner you're like oh man good luck if you're Landing into just any normal bottom D you're like oh good luck yeah exactly uh it's
4:41:13
it's pretty effective either way and can help set up nly um it's a little bit tough but it can work
4:41:20
Wukong here this is interesting it can really help the Jinx front to back quite effectively and can be an extra peel
4:41:26
tool so I think this is a pretty safe Choice the problem is that because didn't look like he wanted to play it
4:41:32
the problem is that like it's just going to get completely out uh farmed by n in most cases and isn't going to have the
4:41:38
same poke impact double sets this is wild that's a bit of fun maybe go even
4:41:45
further and lock in Karina instead BD no it's going to be Ari okay so that'll be
4:41:51
where the magic damage is coming from and that will mean that BD is going to be pretty deadly this game because a lot of armor is going to be necessary it
4:41:58
does feel to me like Jinx is a little bit out of place in this draft personally because I think the only real
4:42:03
peel you're seeing is a bit of a zed hover there from carrier we'll see what Faker is actually going to be playing as
4:42:09
nefir would be fun you know if he Z it's just a throwaway cuz it's not I think the Gallo makes so much sense yeah I
4:42:15
mean Gallo into Ari is already incredibly strong um because especially
4:42:21
like when Ari thinks she's like oh I'm just going to go proc electrocute be careful you watch out you end up getting caught by that Gallo he combos you at
4:42:26
level three um he has that magic resistance built up into his kit and it's very annoying to deal with his
4:42:32
shield and if you're trying to go in Hisar and you get caught and get taunted then it's just a disaster um has great
4:42:39
setup for the N too uh if you can set up for a punch or a taunt and nearly spear always connects so I'm going to be
4:42:45
honest I feel like some parts of this draft for KT rollster I could get behind like the the Jinx plus Leon I'm like
4:42:51
cool we build around a pick comp now you have the Ari but just remember what you're playing into the shields from this Karma the mobile Ezreal who are you
4:42:59
picking who are you finding in T1 composition who's the one who's going to die to set that up a Jax probably not
4:43:05
you know and and that's where I I feel like T1 or rather KT rollster should have pivoted based on what we saw there
4:43:12
in the draft and they did not so they're hyper indexing on this now there's Synergy in this draft for sure I just
4:43:19
wonder what they hit what they what their grab to set up for the Jinx when we actually get down to brass tacks in
4:43:26
these team fights the one issue that I'm looking at on T1 side of things is their lack of any sort of engage option
4:43:33
outside of just Gallo dropping and you need someone to already be in there I think if a Jax does it if he gets a
4:43:39
really good flank angle then there's your option I guess but outside of that there's no real way to get in so much of
4:43:45
this hinges on Doran is what it kind of feels like to me playing well so far see how he goes right
4:43:54
[Music]
4:44:01
here all right here we are ladies and gentlemen onto the rift for the second game of the Telecom War the first of the
4:44:07
lck cup ever in the history of everything ever no lck cup has ever had
4:44:13
a telecom War like they're having one today we could have the record of most Telecom Wars ever this year oh my God if
4:44:19
they're both in the same group in lck and we get the triple round robin of that and then they beat in playoffs
4:44:25
multiple times I mean we could break the record for the amount of Telecom Wars in an lck cup like every single time they
4:44:32
face off absolutely insane in the year in in the year though like 2025 like
4:44:38
this additional one you know they could play against each other in playoffs potentially and then you have you know
4:44:44
first two round Robins at lck triple if they're in the same group and off play
4:44:49
as well in like uh in in like lower bracket and up a bracket and things like this now what if they're in playin too I
4:44:55
mean consider that man um so I'm just saying it's pretty exciting for telekom war lovers it is a great thing and
4:45:02
hopefully we just never see scanner ever again in the Telecom War also on top of all of that now let's talk about these
4:45:08
drafts again cuz you mentioned something that's a really good point is the lack of engage for tan outside of you know
4:45:13
gallo and the ja which perfect spaces really well here with his acceleration gate yeah acceleration gate actually
4:45:19
giving you the extra movement speed so that walk at you and do stun with counter- strike just doesn't work kind
4:45:25
of unusual to see that at level one but in this matchup works out really well in this particular case um but yeah it can
4:45:30
lead to a kind of a weird game State later on if the game is pretty even where it's kind of this Unstoppable
4:45:36
Force which is KT rollster in this case versus immovable object the anti-dive for T1 is pretty insane like they have
4:45:42
the shielding for from Cara they have The Counter Strike they have gallot taunt and ult and you know the mobility
4:45:50
of the Ezreal and the mobility of everyone because they have a Karma makes it really weird how these team fights
4:45:57
can yeah he's he uh he took a back looks like and um I guess they took a fair bit
4:46:03
of damage that may have been the outcome here is uh duck is now standing in the brush because carrier is in between the
4:46:11
turrets and he knows exactly where he is remember last time when duct HD it didn't work out this time either yeah
4:46:17
and now he's getting no experience he's still level one smash is level three because carrier actually gave up a fair
4:46:23
bit of it and Arcane shift has to be buffed very nicely done there from Smash one last pesky minion meant that he
4:46:29
didn't take any of the turret damage and now do can barely do anything in this
4:46:34
Lane oh God already down to half Health smash has cleans still too by the way so he's like not scared of way even little
4:46:41
bit yep oh man he doesn't even get that Mele minion experience oh it's an absolute
4:46:48
disas I told cuz was clearing on the top side of the map so he does manage to get at least that but still smash is really
4:46:55
good at doing what Guma does which is winning Lanes with uh Reckless or in this case carrier uh you know first time
4:47:02
but he's showing some Success With It uh when they have a winning bottom Lane he excels at it actually he's very good at
4:47:08
it um he's a master of it I would say I also think I mean now finally do might
4:47:14
hit level two but it's like the damage has been done this is already doomed he can't even kill the minions the minions
4:47:19
are too strong yeah he's still on one CS yeah he's 24 behind God okay there's
4:47:26
the second one doubled his CS in that one moment absolutely gorgeous owner's going to come on over and they are just
4:47:32
fre pickings underneath this turret right now wait hold on lukong pre6 maybe he can bail him out well he is going to
4:47:37
move over here he's level four has the double Buffs as doam gets that 10 gold that's more
4:47:44
gold than he's got from most of these minions to be honest with you okay now they're going to make their
4:47:50
way in carrier misses the que no spear going to connect there either as dock oh
4:47:56
gets a few of them so he's sitting on nine now but he's still so incredibly far behind he's going to have to go for a back once again yeah I mean everyone
4:48:05
knows that feeling when you're trying to dodge like a zerth Al and you're like o you know I hope this goes well I mean that's Duck's whole experience here as
4:48:12
he's not getting minions and his 25 CS behind and yeah um he's 600 gold behind
4:48:18
without any kills going over yeah uh and he's not having a good
4:48:23
time he's still level two Doran is also not having a very good time uh in this matchup against perfect perfect actually
4:48:30
uh changing up his play style quite nicely moving into this G this game playing very aggressively finding the
4:48:36
angles that he needs and Faker also I mean he's doing phenomenally well as far as Farm is concerned they'll be very
4:48:42
even by the time this minion wave does fall down and yeah I don't no notes really on the
4:48:49
T1 side but KT they would really like to have an 8 carry uh he managed to buy some brown bags smash is going to come
4:48:55
up and just triage this Lane uh for Doran and the Jax moving into the lane
4:49:01
with the Jinx is going to mean that he's going to have free Farm in that scenario as well yeah TP to come through here is
4:49:08
perfect it's going to come up here and try to put some pressure onto smash level six doesn't matter that much for
4:49:14
Jace but uh does have a level lead and that's some additional stats here but it's not a true 1 V one cuz Saria shows
4:49:21
up he has to leave and until cuz hits level six he doesn't really want to get too involved uh bdd on the other hand is
4:49:28
going to come up here they have a really nice setup here for grubs now way also on the plank and T1 need to be really respectful here Faker can ult in but
4:49:35
it's a risky call yeah honey fruit going to be eaten here by bdd as cuz will be able to take down the first grub can
4:49:42
actually just back away now if they would like to but instead they're going to pull it out perfect going to just shock blast the wave see what he can get
4:49:49
done here as the grand Masters might now available here for Doran perfect is keeping KT in this game and his control
4:49:55
of the Top Lane his pushback on Smash there the group that they have with cuz coming up there super fast to the grubs
4:50:00
means it's really difficult for T1 to enter and even with Jinx uh you know not having a ton of money KT are able to get
4:50:07
the first objective on lock here and you know first blood still on the table for them potentially it's probably not going
4:50:13
to happen anywhere around duck at the moment but certainly could still be a window into getting that first Feats of
4:50:19
Strength setup and you know that's I think about as good as it could be here for KT is actually getting all three and
4:50:26
he gets all that CS yeah that's that's better than getting all three man uh that is that that's the feeling that
4:50:31
they're looking for only down 600 gold despite how you know Doom and Gloom we've been about how this bottom Lane is
4:50:37
gone the fact that dockon didn't exist until only a few minutes ago and you can see smash already with his
4:50:43
Sheen completed has his tier stacking up now as Well's going to be moving on over
4:50:48
carer turns up at the same time we'll just have to see whether the lack of engage from T1 is going to rear its head
4:50:55
right because not having the ability to sort of turn on a dime and just try to
4:51:00
start a fight when you want to is difficult and unless Doran is just going to be diving into the middle of them and
4:51:06
Trust falling alongside Faker it's going to be a difficult time if T1 just have full control of the area they have a lot
4:51:13
of range they have a lot of poke and that could be their Avenue to success that's what I'm really thinking is going
4:51:18
to be what this game looks like based on what we've seen so far but being 30 CS
4:51:24
behind as anyone who's played solo que with the support that's trolling you as an 8 carry as long as you don't die
4:51:30
though and you keep farming that 30 CS Gap means less and less the longer the game goes on and if you're set up for
4:51:37
success in a team fight um which isn't the case us Sports trolling but in a pro
4:51:42
game like this duck still has some angles back into relevance it's not so big of a gap that it's unwinable and
4:51:48
perfect man he is crushing it B's committed to the to the ulti in Doran
4:51:53
grandm might does come down teleport from F gets in there very very slowly it's a bit of a turtle Port
4:51:59
unfortunately this stage of the game did you just make that right now if haven't heard I've been wanting to say it all
4:52:05
season I'm not going to lie I'm not going to lie God so good
4:52:10
all right good T1 still I mean they've taken a couple of plates down if we had have been hit by that he would be
4:52:16
immediately trying to go home and I think DOD is right there with him oh my God the damage it's kind of absurd well
4:52:22
I mean they didn't get the kill top side but they got faker's teleport you know so now right now BD has a pretty big
4:52:28
advantage in mid lane doran's going to be able to get I think probably all of that farm there it looks like but still
4:52:33
taking a bit of a Tempo lead and we've seen duck constantly try to get whatever minions he can he's going top side now
4:52:39
he's like maybe I can get goes um he's really just not farming very well given the circumstances I think it's fine and
4:52:46
he has had some great CS under turret um but it's it's the first few team fights we have to see KT set him up uh to where
4:52:53
he can get back into this game if they lose a team fight or two then it's like well now it's doomed I mean now you just can't do anything you're just a paper
4:52:58
weight in this game yeah duck does make it up to grab this cannon minion that is huge news it is and getting towards uh
4:53:06
the the weird item that has a name that I find difficult to pronounce starts with why the un's arrows yeah that's the
4:53:12
one um I used to be so confident with it and I'm just not anymore he he can also
4:53:18
like make a slight like Global impact with his ultimate you know what if he steals a kill that way I mean that's
4:53:24
half the gold lead that smash has just washed away I mean there are ways yeah that's uh in theory a possibility as
4:53:30
okay total Port is gone it is regular teleport again now and um Doran is not
4:53:37
having the same game as he was last time around I don't think it's going to matter too much um unless he starts dying in these lanes
4:53:44
and no one's done that just yet remember they the time to beat is 20 minutes approximately for the latest first blood
4:53:50
that is true now Doran is still very relevant even behind in CS as a s lane
4:53:56
threat we does have flash should be okay here he's not even going to take that much damage to the clips but oh my God
4:54:02
that is so much poke Trish Rush kills him all right well I thought I cast her that's what happens when you get hit by
4:54:09
everything by the way ladies gentlemen and when eclipse is down it hurts a little bit more yeah oh my God okay well
4:54:15
that should be uh an equalization of grubs okay well and that's also first
4:54:21
blood so y it's a lot of extra money going over to T1 and the fact that smash picks it up oh God great true shot
4:54:28
barrage from him the thing about this situation I was going to mention going to the Jacks and all that before we really overextended there is you know if
4:54:35
they get four five the Jax is significantly weaker as a s Side Lane threat cuz he doesn't have those grubs in his it he's down on CS but now
4:54:42
they're even inubs oh dear and I mean duck is not in the safe place well Ino
4:54:48
way he's trying to get revenge as bdd is Dashing forward super mega Death tget doesn't do anything but that does not
4:54:53
matter they still answer the death of way with a kill on Carrier support for
4:54:59
support no first blood for KT duck doesn't get any of the gold unfortunately but he's going to feel a
4:55:06
little bit uh less pressured here as he continues to try to C Us in this game um duck dobs is playing a different game
4:55:12
from everybody else right now he's he's playing triage simulator he's just doing his very best to try and keep himself
4:55:17
alive as much as possible you guys remember that that old DS game Trauma
4:55:22
Center so uh I mean we is like so out of bounds here avoids the
4:55:28
spear and then watch theage spear also hit yeah the spear also hit that's so crazy much damage he
4:55:36
had the flash to live and he didn't and then car here this actually looked like it was a really nice dive setup for duckon but KT actually matched the play
4:55:44
really well a bit of an overextension there from the karma and K is taken out 1,000 gold the advantage here for T1 but
4:55:51
there is still that team fight power yep in this KT draft I think we're not quite
4:55:58
going to be riding the obituary just yet it's not looking good if you're a KT fan but there's still a few more opportunity
4:56:04
yeah we were calling the game over in draft in the last game I'm happy to say that we're not calling the game over yet
4:56:09
at all um although it is looking a little rough especially for the Jinx still you do
4:56:15
have a fair bit of longevity and as we mentioned before these uh engage issues might start rearing their head on T1
4:56:22
side unless they can just hit all the Poke like they just did last time right they do have somewhat of a range Advantage uh not necessarily
4:56:28
consistently um with the fact that doc arm does have uh very long range with his
4:56:33
Rockets as cuz looking to deny this feed of strength okay this is a really really
4:56:39
scary position though for for KT roll they lose this fight decisively I mean they might not have a way back in this
4:56:44
game yeah FAS teleport just about to come back up again as we goes in finds the solar flare Superga death rocket
4:56:50
Landing his carrier so incredibly low Doran no option cannot do anything and
4:56:55
there goes the Drake as well it's beautifully played here for KT to make sure that they deny those Feats of
4:57:01
Strength and get even more now the J able to teleport back to the top side so that that first turret blood not going
4:57:07
to go over as well PD with some spare time in the Lane will be answered by T1
4:57:13
trying to push in mid here like there will be an opportunity here for KT to be able to remove these Minions only a
4:57:19
plate goes over it's very split BD is going to get one though Solo in the bottom Lane much stronger we'll see if
4:57:24
Doran teleports uh to the bottom Lane he going to trade with Faker who will get interrupted but then punches his way
4:57:30
away you can see that on the mini map he's going to teleport bottom instead here but Bey at the last possible second grabbing that plate is pretty huge now
4:57:37
this is kind of a protect the president type of composition when you are going to front to back like this way goes in and engages the rocket here from Duck
4:57:43
Dom and the target section on the carer is fantastic Doran unfortunately is left out to dry the Cyclone locks him in
4:57:49
place really well played there from KT just divide and conquer they didn't even have to really do that front to back
4:57:55
they didn't really even have to protect duck Dom in this case because they split the team fight instantly ways engage
4:58:00
initially looked a little bit suspect but the way they all followed up on it the way they were able to collapse on the Cara was really well played and the
4:58:07
Doran is kind of unfortunately alone to die that's a small dent in the Ed Curry for
4:58:13
difference oh now Doran going to get comboed here as perfect just boops him away Fair bit of value Cinders all over
4:58:20
the ground as we are gifted a infernal Soul this game second of the day yeah
4:58:27
and the gold man is so even this game feels playable this time around KT
4:58:32
they've done a pretty good job trying to even it out next objective will be Feats of Strength for either team or if this
4:58:40
uh next turret is going to go down owner going to be able to steal away that uh
4:58:46
Rift scuttler very very nice as a bit of a change in position here between Doran and perfect doesn't work out so well for
4:58:52
Doran though as he does lose his Counter Strike trop barage to get rid of the minion wave as this could be a solo kill
4:58:57
unless wey decides to come over and steal it but the leap strike going to be there and Doran Will Survive for the
4:59:03
moment Jinx rocket thougher death rocket is Sailing by majestically that's a turret still here oh it's going to be
4:59:10
though let's see how quickly perect can take this down smash just needs another one and it's not going to win that was
4:59:17
the first turret going over to KT so once again it's just whoever gets the next objective is going to get those
4:59:23
feet of strength yeah 3 seconds till the herald spawns here having that top side turret though feels very valuable if you
4:59:29
can control that top side leading into the herald fight but mid turret similar story very very close game here suddenly
4:59:36
KT only 300 gold behind and yes there's a big gap in the bottom Lane but this is an almost equally big gap in the Top
4:59:43
Lane as Doran is finding himself victim to perfect who's basically decided that Jace is like gragas with a hammer he's
4:59:51
like oh Counter Strike I've got a little gragas belly hammer for you on that one and he just keeps pushing them away keeps taking these good trades I mean
4:59:58
look at the build here for Doran as well it's quite bizarre yeah try to tank the good old tank Jax understanding that he
5:00:06
is like the one guy that that is going to be frontlining this game dockon tagged by a spear is exactly the person
5:00:12
you do not want tagged by a spear or by the true shop barrage as now Doran
5:00:17
looking for that angle they poke shell in the eye let's see whether they do manage to lock this one down that's the steal from oner that gets them the Feats
5:00:24
of Strength B can they win the team fight Doran already going to go down Doom getting excited and the essence is
5:00:29
picked up by bdd throws the or of deception through and it looks like KT just wanted to get out of there but
5:00:35
Faker says no dock d goes down and BD has to flash to get out of the way
5:00:41
Spirit fire going to give him that extra movement speed he gets himself out of there do I'm not so lucky way was
5:00:47
already dead and T1 getting the Feats of Strength and getting themselves the rift Aral to continue pushing forward a this
5:00:54
is so massive for T1 and KT rolster they got the initial pick on the Doran they
5:00:59
do not however get the herald like you say and are unable to win the subsequent fight the super mega Death rocket
5:01:06
actually does a lot of AOE damage to the team but doesn't help them isolate a single Target here as Faker goes in on
5:01:11
doran's engage you can see the game plan here for T1 but Doran is actually pulled back way obviously way out in the middle
5:01:18
of nowhere here Faker would have been maybe an ideal Target here but BD is not able to close the gap the rocket doesn't
5:01:24
hit Faker and he just goes in for the reengage duck has nothing no way to get out BD of course will be more fortunate
5:01:30
because he's a little bit more mobile but it was almost so good for KT there but it's a huge win for
5:01:36
T1 and I mean it's it's still a playable game here but that's that's a big deficit dor may be uh yeah I've seen
5:01:44
this movie before but the Zenith blade not going to connect and that turret is still up owner also in the area carrier
5:01:50
going to turn up as well and shock blast going to be traded for a missed spear that is going to be
5:01:56
the dragon spawning though Faker is on the top side that has teleport up and available and T1 looking to grab this
5:02:02
first infernal cuz I don't think wants to give this one away without a fight control Ward going over the wall they
5:02:08
are going to try and clear out whatever Vision they can find as fer still waiting knows that BD is up here as well
5:02:14
so has some opportunity to stick around on the top side of the map yeah this is
5:02:19
a really really awkward spot here for KT last time I said that though they were able to fight their way through with way going for a crazy engage Baker can both
5:02:27
show up with his ult and his teleport so yeah being even generally close to the
5:02:32
objective is a big problem for KT rollster and they just can't really have that same way up this time he's isolated
5:02:39
oh God and he's he's by himself like why why are we doing this he does manage to get some CC onto spash who may not have
5:02:44
wanted to go this far forward but Faker is there to protect him owner in the backline cuz almost kills him finally
5:02:50
does manage to take him that's a solo kill that's kind of insane where is smash going this fight is all over the
5:02:57
place but dock is the one that's truly isolated and perfect does not find the
5:03:02
shock blast um yeah okay it almost looks okay for KT but T1 really turned that one
5:03:08
around and it should be Dragon for them yeah close but no cigar a story of many
5:03:14
almosts for KT rollster in this series and this is just another example as we is dead so he has to commit now CU is
5:03:20
looking for the flank here with the blast cone he can still use Warriors tricker if he actually has that blast to
5:03:26
close the gap so he he basically has an insane Gap close goes onto the nle here smash takes a ton of damage and then
5:03:32
duck here unfortunately tries to link up with the top side of the team fight instead of chasing smash with perfect and ends up just kind of running into
5:03:38
three Angry T M so not the right call there I think but was a tough situation either way I don't know if he lives but
5:03:44
going that direction certainly helped smash get out of Dodge who's sitting on three kills now kind of miraculously
5:03:51
survives there with the help of his teammates and it was a cool idea like and they salvaged way so well there with
5:03:58
that flank from cuz but it's just too little too late it just keeps being one step forward two or three steps
5:04:04
backwards for KT in this series just like when they almost killed Faker last game
5:04:10
and uh you know it's just these kind of small things that are starting to really pile up here yeah although there's no
5:04:17
scanner on the opposing side so I think it's infinitely better here for KT I think KT fans can feel like it's not
5:04:24
just completely over right now as Faker gets a cute little taunt and stops perfect from pushing this one up looks
5:04:31
like cuz is going to be able to get this uh infernal Drake without too much hassle and it's adakan towards the top
5:04:37
side of the map that might be the option here as far as a trade for T1 or maybe catching Doom in transition TOP turret
5:04:44
is an opportunity for bdd Dives on top of Ona solar Flair is going to stun him up there as well he gets heals but it's
5:04:50
not going to be enough and now CU Warrior tricks toova looks for the Cyclone gets the knock off super mega
5:04:56
Death rocket connects smash gets over the wall though and that shock blast does not land they may need to take a
5:05:02
consolation carrier and there it is cuz going to be out to knock down that kill and with two dead one of them being the
5:05:08
jungler it may be time to grab themselves an adakan as this tra barrage is going to soften them up momentarily
5:05:15
teleport in to stop Doran from just destroying their house bdd wants to remove the minion wave but it's not
5:05:21
going to be enough actually that turret is going to die the true shop barage from Smash is actually super valuable
5:05:26
here I mean these health bars are so low Doran wants to come in and contest they may have an angle Faker has TP as well
5:05:31
yeah the heroic entrance going to be there with that Smite it could be a dangerous one dock on with the DPS and C
5:05:37
almost just dead to Aon but no they're going to be able to take it down down now with that buff it's going to be difficult for Doran to really do too
5:05:43
much and he is just going to catch the wave the rest of KT going to back away and so that is a big objective now
5:05:48
picked up here on the KT side of things but they need to make it work for them yeah now I mean this is the first almost
5:05:54
that's a KT almost they're trading it for inner turret mid and top I don't know whether that's worth because
5:06:00
Shell's going to come through and make things uh very very difficult here we'll see what they can get because Bing is
5:06:06
going in yeah he's going in and he may as well he does have the Aon buff and they're going to take down carrier so it's already worth it I guess BD dashing
5:06:13
around gets a bit of extra Essence by helping take down the support let's have a look at this fight one more time
5:06:18
though as owner he stayed alive for a lot longer than I was expecting he he's just so squishy and it's a really nice follow up here from wey U and with his
5:06:25
heal like you say he survives a little bit longer here but this is a huge win smash's Ultimate though as he is able to
5:06:31
escape here narrowly is actually really massive it's almost enough to give Doran the opportunity to stop them from doing
5:06:37
Aon as uh really want to watch cuz this is really important cuz getting the
5:06:42
double Cyclone here as Doran with that Counter Strike just standing vigil but he's not going to save owner perfect
5:06:47
going down very low cuz as well is in trouble and wait never mind he's actually going to be okay Warrior
5:06:53
trickster comes through and remember they have the UT com buff so he's playing with Reckless abandon wayy going in dock is probably pretty dead at this
5:07:02
point in time yeah that's going to be dor help blocking that one down pretty resed hey there we go but also still
5:07:07
gives away a little bit of gold is BD I mean q the the Yaky Sachs as he's
5:07:13
underneath the enemy turret looking to see whether he can take down smash he's not going to be able to C from Beyond
5:07:18
the Grave comes on through there seems like nobody can kill Smash in this game he is he has been so close to death many
5:07:25
times but uh again it's been a game of almost but KT almost getting wiped on Aon but not actually dying and actually
5:07:32
successfully uh taking that objective looked like it might have been a big opportunity for them but it wasn't that huge okay cuz can he get the interrupt
5:07:38
not with his without his ultimate yeah and not without any ability to uh really know what's going on in there and so
5:07:45
doesn't actually do so so teleport is going to be utilized there from Doran I think they know that that happened so
5:07:51
this is where things start to get you know it it starts off really well for KT cuz's angle is really nice here um taunt
5:07:57
goes on the way well really good angle perfect is playing such a good game here on this ja once again you know just
5:08:04
going super deep here to look for some additional damage unfortunately um you know with this Jace
5:08:10
you're very vulnerable very squishy so he will of course just go back to the Fountain and they try to turn this into
5:08:17
a big set of kills plus inner turret there not quite able to finish and land
5:08:22
fully on the Mark I guess cross the finish line on that play nice try though with this dive you can see though how
5:08:27
difficult it is to fully commit into T1 especially when there's a turret standing in your way yeah I mean I mean
5:08:34
it was arakan so maybe we can say that you know they're redeemed a little bit on that front be able to pick up the uh
5:08:41
red buff for the team and now going to defend this inner turret so Faker here
5:08:46
on this bottom side outers and inners is going to be just free money here for T1 who have really rid the map of these
5:08:54
structures and smash has done so much damage yeah he's uh really making things work for him doc not so much himself
5:09:01
yeah we'll have to see whether the late game is going to be where DOD can actually Thrive this game for smash is
5:09:06
definitely a little bit better showcase what he indiv J is capable of um because his positioning has been great he's
5:09:12
gotten out of so many sticky situations in this one he's gotten high value out of his ultimates he got the snipe onto
5:09:17
way earlier his true shot barrage was was very very strong earlier on this one clears most of the minion wave I mean
5:09:24
the guy is just he can do no wrong um but uh no one's ever Ed a midwave with Israel before this guy's actually on to
5:09:30
something he is he's able to clear it out majoritively it's nuts and that that out of turret in the mid lane still
5:09:37
stands that's the ridiculous spot as way is always so far up it's making me nervous he's he's the guy who wants to
5:09:44
set up these traps though for T1 and uh this is really like again KT
5:09:50
walking a fine line here on this Dragon yeah cuz already getting it so incredibly low as owner out of vision
5:09:56
right now Faker actually engaging onto ways not really the priority Target there's the Cyclone into the backline
5:10:02
faker gets interrupted no heroic charge for him as now smash might have his first death of the series but no he
5:10:09
shifts away keeps himself alive it is going to be Soul point for KT they kill owner it is probably still a great trade
5:10:16
for them but the fact that smash survives that's sick and Doran trying to get on in here as Doom able to get the
5:10:22
flame trumpers down leap strike to avoid them Doom gets taunted but he does have the barrier can he keep himself Al alive
5:10:28
the answer is no and there is the knock up on the C as well Warrior trickster comes in he gets oh my goodness the
5:10:34
Cinders to keep him alive as oh Doran you didn't want to take that one it's the Howard is going to finish him off
5:10:41
and BD is going to be able to pick up that extra money smash he's just taking away the enemy jungle living life to the
5:10:48
fullest this is such a wild this is the Telecom War we were looking for no
5:10:53
exactly uh okay so the strategy here for KT
5:10:58
starts to seem intentionally way sacrifices himself to get cool Downs to set up an engage where duck then gets
5:11:05
excited and it's been working out sort of well the problem is they're a little bit split this time around is Lut smash
5:11:10
you called it out barely able to get over the wall there has the shield from car gets true shot barrage value once
5:11:17
again and then Faker is the one who helps clean up the end of this fight yeah this the world's smallest
5:11:24
teleport but it's actually kind of perfect cuz it's the only way he can close the gap here to get in here gets a flash as well taunt duck puts him out of
5:11:31
the fight that's all the damage gone cuz if duck is able to somehow Loop there and BD is hitting these charms the the
5:11:37
Chase has to end otherwise this is just disaster for T1 really well played here
5:11:42
by Baker a risky call but it absolutely paid off's not too happy about how that ended
5:11:47
though yeah we're glad he didn't finish that word as well so that is a little bit of a mistake on doran's side but as
5:11:54
you can see with his build this guy is playing support Jacks this game uh as he
5:11:59
does some amplify faker's damage in this one with his Abyssal mask kind of
5:12:05
cute I'm still not sure who's going to win this game wolf I actually don't know it is KT they are behind about 2 and a2k
5:12:12
as perfect endurant once again fighting uh you know I feel like the winner of this game is smash no matter who wins
5:12:19
who whoever explodes maybe the winner of the game is actually us yeah um cuz he's
5:12:24
just playing so well bdd I think is is his counterpart on the other side like he's had a phenomenal game perfect to too to be fair Y and duck it's not like
5:12:32
he's playing badly just was handicapped from the beginning a and cuz it's like 404 cuz not found in uh in in Wolf's
5:12:39
all look I just didn't want to say we's having a bit of a struggle he's got his fours in the wrong position yeah I'm
5:12:45
like everybody except we is having a pretty good time away is sacrificing himself right so that's why uh yeah they
5:12:51
I mean all of KT can never perform at the same time that would not be KT at all yeah somebody has to be Barrel in
5:12:57
this case exactly he's cosplaying yeah oh does that oh even gets the C he's
5:13:02
does he die dead yeah uh because yeah smash just chases him down has the extra movement speed from the Inspire and and
5:13:09
it is so Doom like this is this should be just Baron this time wait you're not supposed to go and nobody's there you're
5:13:16
not supposed to just back but dark time you're not allowed to be there because smashes chases you down die everybody
5:13:21
knows exactly like literally every person who played more than 10 games of League of Legends knows exactly that
5:13:28
feeling where you're like I zap that and I think it'll be okay like I think I can get that like hold on let me zap that
5:13:34
Cannon and I need this money I'm so desperate I haven't been able to farm all game it's not fair they took my
5:13:39
minions away he's like hold let me zap
5:13:44
this he was tunneling and then the speed up from car maybe something he didn't calculate for
5:13:50
but Baker was also there smash also hit every button absolutely nailing it
5:13:56
really nicely played and now there's just a casual Baron on T1 all just because do arm was a little bit too far
5:14:03
up in the lane he did zap that minion though he did get the cannon money that is very true so are we thinking cuz
5:14:11
owner I mean it's not like he's had a bad game he was definitely pal for game one but it was scarner so like are we really weighting that highly or is it
5:14:17
the narrative smash vote am I right oh 100% it's a narrative smash vote there is no way it could be any other vote I
5:14:23
feel like it just has to be the narrative smash vote I mean he's perfect KDA um he died one time in game one he
5:14:29
got first blood in game one yeah what are you talking about it was old smash the whole time mind controlled way like
5:14:36
he had superpowers I mean Faker also had really good series um but let's see whether you know I mean we maybe we're
5:14:43
being Hasty yeah I don't think we're being too hasty having this discussion as Faker is going to get caught out momentarily going to get stopped by
5:14:49
those Fain flame Chompers as we is dead but can they kill Faker the Cyclone comes in and yes they can carrier to go
5:14:57
down as well and the resets are starting to come through bdd does need to be careful because smash oh he gets Charmed
5:15:03
and he immediately just Arcane shift cleanses gets out do almost just eyes to
5:15:09
that true shop barrage and remember there's a man Advantage for KT but it doesn't feel like it because smashes
5:15:15
here and he's looking to just take matters into his own hands Dorne going golden at about zero Health the zaps are
5:15:21
connecting you have to kill smash KT you have to kill him otherwise he will kill all of you as perfect gets on top of him
5:15:27
there's the shutdown and KT they lose no one and it's an Ace and that's infernal
5:15:33
Soul maybe we were Hasty at every time you doubt KT every time
5:15:39
it's a unanimous prediction against them I see that fan sign out out in the crowd every now and then they show the shot
5:15:44
where the girls got all the KT PRS for the home stand or home ground or whatever it was called and and KT wins
5:15:51
right like this is just how it goes sometimes but this is a big overextension from T1 and you're like
5:15:56
okay man Advantage but smash disadvantage KD don't have that guy but still even he oh de it in as well that
5:16:04
Tower is not long for the world and they lose the goat at the same time perfect is dealing with this but what is going
5:16:09
on they're 131 and they're taking everything on the map they have a gold lead out of nowhere they have a dragon
5:16:15
soul I'm excited to do I don't blame you blink and suddenly KT roster bringing
5:16:21
you to game feels like but we're not there yet but I mean what it was blink and then T1 had Baron out of nowhere as
5:16:28
well like this is like we're it's it's not actually League of Legends anymore we're playing tennis or bad mitt or
5:16:33
something like that yeah um oops flame trumpets yeah do where duck I think he
5:16:41
just doesn't walk very fast you know he doesn't have Flash either yeah he's now
5:16:46
really not walking very fast he's got barrier does manage to break those chains as Dorian doesn't find the
5:16:51
Counter-Strike keep walking flame trumpet and doom will live he even did the fear barrier and I love it perfect
5:16:58
drop in the acceleration gate for him oh there we go he was not walking fast but he walked a few percentages faster for a
5:17:05
second he looked so slow man oh man this is not this is Faker teleporting to die we've had a few of those this season um
5:17:12
yeah that one wasn't his most ideal oh smash oh dear heroic entrance that's
5:17:17
fantastic so Faker keeps the ad carry alive and now maybe they'll be to get a turn has C down to 50% if smash ever
5:17:25
gets a few moments to throw out some abilities it's it's so scary he's one of those Ezreal that just gets more damage
5:17:32
right do is like please TR sh that I need some minions man he's like oh for me like he immed
5:17:39
walked towards it he was like oh I'm so sorry du you can have it I need him to sell his berserker's Greaves and just buy swifties like I need him to go
5:17:46
faster than this it's making me so anxious well maybe they'll get a kill and then he'll get excited and he'll run a little bit faster we've got Elder
5:17:53
Drake up in uh 4 minutes time I um maybe that's where this game will be decided
5:17:58
wolf I don't know I just think that like the lack of engage for T1 from
5:18:03
behind you can feel it a lot more um and now that the Jinx is actually relevant in this game still 2,000 C behind by the
5:18:10
way but still is going to have a huge amount of damage output with the p setups that that KT have here and you
5:18:16
have someone has to go in it's tank dor going in but he doesn't have his arm guard anymore you know and yes owner has
5:18:21
zonas but he's not the engage it's really Faker who has to maybe try to set something up here and it gets kind of
5:18:27
scary and getting caught as way has for a lot of this game isn't necessarily going to happen anymore uh and it's not
5:18:32
necessarily going to be the gamechanging pick if you do get it especially because KT can turn off of Way's death so well and they have so many times especially
5:18:39
CU on this Wukong his angles he's found have been so good this game so much of the reason KT swing back and gold as
5:18:45
heavily as they did is cuz they didn't have that many turrets killed they suddenly got a lot of turrets they got all of them so they they they equalized
5:18:52
and actually they took an extra inner because T1 hadn't quite managed to get the bottom Lane in a turret as dock
5:18:59
realizing that smash still does have a lot of items Baron is up in 30 seconds
5:19:04
owner doesn't have Flash he is n so you know steals are possible so they're going to have to do their due diligence
5:19:10
about Vision which they haven't quite been able to do just yet I was going to say do they have to it's KT maybe the rules don't apply they should yes should
5:19:17
is is definitely that's the operative word instead they're going to go buy items and now T1 is going to have full vision control they had Vision on the
5:19:23
right side of the pit where they were looking for a potential opportunity to to make a play around a baron start and
5:19:28
now they just have full pryo entirely so now that engage bom let's especially running at Doom who is once again taking
5:19:34
too much damage that is another true barage he just walks too slow ladies and gentlemen KT trying to make up for a
5:19:41
carrier going to go down owner goes golden but it does not save him and everyone's just in the KT blender CU
5:19:48
looking for it Tak a matters into his own hands gets the extended range on the que and smash goes down Doran is tank
5:19:54
Jacks I don't know what he's supposed to really do here he goes golden a little bit and then BD takes him down and Faker
5:20:00
is running for the hills the Bramble back will be able to block some of the damage but KT after using do D's bait
5:20:07
are going to be able to win in the fight and it's only the goat that is Left Alive Well for
5:20:13
now oh let's see he is now on Vision still getting hunted
5:20:19
down I think he's get some Cinders yeah he should be all right Cinders are unfair let cheating yeah now KT going to
5:20:25
get the bar they can now use the baron maybe wait 4 seconds but now they can use the baron to take an elder so KT
5:20:32
really in favor Carri is like I'm sheling and everyone's like I'm walking fast we're getting on ducked and duck is
5:20:39
just like they can't play the game the problem is cu is like wow man they all walked right into my Cy so much Cyclone
5:20:44
value yeah he's like he's like oh you guys are all walking all on top of each other towards my ad carry and it really
5:20:49
makes me upset he presses R they all get knocked into the air and then bdd comes over here to help clean up the kills man
5:20:56
if duck somehow miraculously survives there imagine the Jinx value too in the fight like that and it was all just based on carrier being like I think we
5:21:02
run on him he pressed two or whatever he's got ASR on probably two and ran at him and then yes operation kill dock was
5:21:10
and honestly don't think it was the the worst call it was the fact that cuz was able to find that perfect angle as
5:21:17
carrier bit of Captain Jack there on the the curial sorry the The thees curial
5:21:23
simitar Crucible Michaels find it right next to Ross buy some crafts and some
5:21:29
use clothing uh perfect he does a decent amount of damage here he also is so
5:21:35
tanky and he's got a lock it for some reason which is cool cuz it
5:21:40
means that maybe when the next true shop barrage comes around he'll be able to Shield it Elder is going to
5:21:46
beak on the FL the flank angle oh this is kind of absurd perfect is like I
5:21:53
don't know something's not right and if they kill CU here that is actually kind of huge they spot Faker here for a
5:21:58
moment Doran Dives in on top of perfect but he taxes himself out using the gallo
5:22:04
and Doran is now going to pay the price oh T1 that that may have been a game
5:22:09
losing play because the Elder Dragon just came up fake is able to get out but it's a four versus five all right KT
5:22:15
going to have to make the call they still have Baron I think this pushing rather than Elder is definitely the way yeah not wanting to take the risk here
5:22:22
but it does give them an opportunity oh B he makes the play catches carrier and the zap almost lands smash able to
5:22:29
create the distance over Faker is dead and we is now pushing forward KT not risking this elder buff at all and it is
5:22:37
only smash left I don't think he's going to be able to do it he takes down way at least he gets that one but it is three
5:22:43
games it was always going to be three games in this Telecom wall I just cannot
5:22:49
believe KT were able to come back and win this one and there were definitely some big flubs from T1 in this game some
5:22:57
overextensions but cuz just said no on his Wukong Way's dying it's okay I'm turning
5:23:04
into a positive oh we lost tuck I found the Cyclone angle Faker thinks he can flank I don't think so cuz completely
5:23:12
plugged into this game looking really really comfortable on the w and you the
5:23:17
call there from Faker on the flank could have been massive and you're thinking oh I can catch this Jace but they Doran
5:23:24
already had his Rocky Jace game like they should have known you can't kill Jace like he's just not going to die it's a tank build he's got to lock it
5:23:31
you just pointed it out I know why does he have a lock it it was very fun I think perfect actually really was VP of
5:23:38
that particular game for me you can see did the most damage for him smash my God
5:23:44
his back was just not quite uh not quite strong enough I was informed that with
5:23:50
these new Buffs and feat of strength that comebacks just weren't going to be possible Atlas and I tell you what I
5:23:56
think I've seen more than than three in the these two weeks H this was this was a comeback and then another comeback and
5:24:03
then the counter comeback and then the comeback happened again like it it was it was completely ridiculous but it's a
5:24:08
telecom War this is how it's supposed to go you can never stop the Telecom war from being a banger we are going to go
5:24:14
to a short break when we get back the space is going to have the pleasure of breaking that down then we'll have game number three we'll see you there

5:31:34
well there's our Telecom War we do have game number two going the way of KT rollster as they were able to take down
5:31:40
a very long game up against T1 and smash looked incredible the rest of T1 felt a
5:31:46
little bit slow and KT man bdd and CZ really pumping up the numbers and carrying the team in a big way we're
5:31:52
going to take a look at the draft thoughts on this guys yeah I mean uh we could definitely see the reason why they
5:31:57
picked up smash uh the whole draft plan was build up around him and I think that
5:32:03
kind of changed the whole plan for T1 yeah I think it's interesting as well uh I mean this this shows how long it has
5:32:08
been since we've seen ezel Karma which is especially kind of surprising because you think of like Carrie and gumma and you think of things like Kate Lu this is
5:32:15
the style of play that's been in the Wheelhouse but you know not really something that we've seen Gooma play as much at the Ed real so it's just it's
5:32:21
cool to see that they bring Smash in immediately like they have the K they have the eel not really Pi who've seen Gooma on as much but they're instantly
5:32:27
willing to lean into them and make the most out of the player who's come up yeah exactly I mean if you're going to
5:32:32
experiment do it right right have prepared drafts have stuff that you can play with with smash that you don't
5:32:39
necessarily feel comfortable with Guma or maybe you know Guma is going to practice it and we'll see him in the future on it as we're taking a look here
5:32:45
at some of the highlights the 31-minute fight that did go the way of KT yeah and
5:32:51
I feel like often the start of the fights we're going pretty well for T1 getting a lot of damage down and smash is doing so much work but it feels like
5:32:58
as soon as you lose a member for T1 it becomes so difficult because you're into a jinx you into an arri it was more so
5:33:04
the Ari than the Jinx I'll be honest in this one but the momentum you get from those resetting alss is big and here
5:33:09
smash really tries to make the hero play but there's just too many threats to deal with yeah outside of the team fight
5:33:16
uh when you have azra Karma you snowb the lane and that's way how you win the game out of it but I think they made
5:33:24
such a messy mistakes after Ling phase and I think after that their picks kind
5:33:29
of fall off yeah definitely did end up that way and there was a fight in the mid lane that we also had which was kind
5:33:35
of crazy because it looked like okay smash made the hero play he's going to go in get the kill and then it
5:33:43
eventually just goes the way of KT it happens when you're overextending into those resetting alts and into a Wukong I
5:33:49
mean just look at BD's position he's looking for the timing and then whenever he jumps in like he's always aiming for
5:33:56
the damage dealers and that's the reason why KT actually picked up the win against T1 right here you know the T1
5:34:03
composition there's a lot of speed from the karma a lot of Mobility a lot of dashes but they committed so much to get
5:34:08
in to the fight that when they got flanked by thear with this zukon they just didn't have the tools to get out again and smash again tried everything
5:34:15
he could to make the most of it but it really felt like a oneman army situation I mean even though uh T1 was snowballing
5:34:21
the alligate really hard the reason why KT could pick up the win is because uh
5:34:26
bdd and CZ were looking for the plays like so many times together and then it was kind of flawless they didn't have
5:34:32
that like until like 30 minutes like uh so I feel like uh bdd and CZ were just
5:34:38
just such a great Synergy uh on that game especially and honestly you know obviously a lot of this Series has been
5:34:44
focused on Smash and his moveing you know it's a big talking point but I feel like when I saw coz coming on a KT with
5:34:49
bdd after bdd summer performance that was something I was really hyped for to see how they work together I feel like
5:34:55
as much as they've had good performances in some of our previous Series this is an example of those two just having
5:35:00
phenomenal power working together and really taking over a game so the more of this we see the more confidence I'm
5:35:05
going to have in KT and also I really like uh ukong more than Ari nowadays because it's just such a a better pick
5:35:12
and also you could see more flexibility from ukong yes will there's a really good question now that we have a very
5:35:18
new player here to the lck which is we're here in Fearless we're here at the lck cup what does it mean when we start
5:35:24
to get deeper and deeper into these Champion pools because we've already had 20 Champs played he has played the Kaa
5:35:32
and the Ezreal and the Jinx has also gone which he mentioned what's he going to play and what are the rest of the players going to play yeah I think a
5:35:38
thing to be said is that if you followed his time with reckless in uh in challenges he played like everything
5:35:45
like they would pair up stuff where Reckless was playing the center and he'd play things like Le in bot so that is one thing I have like complete faith in
5:35:52
is that if we go deep in Fearless he's going to have something it might be a bit zany but he'll definitely have more picks in the pocket and it's really low
5:35:58
chance in bo3 but I think if it's it was B5 it's like a real Sports you know like
5:36:04
you use 180 cry who plays really aggressive Champions and after like two games you can actually sub in the
5:36:10
players who can play the playmaker like Kuma Yushi and smash so I feel like uh
5:36:16
there is more chance to see if we keep up this phis draft Yeah uh best of fives
5:36:21
would be fun to watch you know if they really desperately wanted to play Jinn maybe they're like okay we got to get Guma in now Sub in yeah the sub comes in
5:36:29
that's a really cool idea you know maybe we'll get there eventually but for now just here at the lck cup but has been
5:36:35
very interesting so far let's see what the conclusion of the series will look like as we will hop back to the casters
5:36:41
here for game number three oh man what an incredible game
5:36:47
number two that we had we're going to forget about game number one and look to go into game number three just expecting
5:36:53
more of that level of action this time around though T1 are going to be moving back to the blue side I think that is
5:36:59
going to be a really big thing for them and KT going to have to dig deep and actually figure out how to get this
5:37:05
draft working when they're on the red side of the map maybe utilize some of this momentum to get themselves there it
5:37:11
was a really big identity gap between those two teams um compositionally and
5:37:17
you know you could see some of the issues of engaging how heavily you have to commit multiple members and how well CU could punish with Wukong and stuff
5:37:24
like that 4 T1 but still it early game was so strong and smash played so well that you know you wanted to believe for
5:37:30
most of that game that they were going to just two Z and uh now this fan here hoping for the 2-1 reverse sweep yep
5:37:38
that's what well it's sort of a reverse sweep it's like a it's a we had a hiccup sweep um I guess if you win game one
5:37:45
lose game I don't know anyway T1 on the blue side no uh unexpected situations
5:37:51
there and smash is going to be playing all the way through to game number three Gushi we know he was sitting in the coach's Booth alongside coma but not
5:37:58
going to be coming in and I think that that makes perfect sense smash no notes as far as how he performed in the last
5:38:04
game and let's have a look to see what's going to happen this time around still a lot of things that have been banned
5:38:10
throughout the entire series uh things like the Azia that's been Perma banned is going to continue being so Essa also
5:38:17
taken away every single game uh the rumble actually just escaped the first
5:38:23
game but then was banned in the second one could be a big thing to look at here moving into game number three and KT
5:38:28
keep Banning the air uh would be the third time in a row in the series uh
5:38:34
with Baker not enjoying the Yon as much as a lot of our mid LAN ERS and no Zas on this roster anymore they've been
5:38:39
Banning that pretty consistently through the the lck cup and that's going to be a continuation here the ash is taken away
5:38:45
the kalista is gone I think a lot of people with questions about what smash is going to play he's known for his Caitlin they're actually going to ban it
5:38:51
which makes you wonder what sort of pick he's looking for here that could be punished by Caitlyn cuz locking it in at
5:38:58
this point as a ban face up is a little bit strange yeah the rumble also is a consideration like you mentioned yeah it
5:39:04
could be a zyon angle perhaps could be uh as Zyra is going to be banned away
5:39:12
not quite Zyra but is going to be ayra and there was a VI used in the
5:39:18
first game so that is not something that can be first pickable here Aurora Rumble Rumble yeah that's what we mentioned
5:39:25
earlier on I wonder if like Cub going to be considering playing that Aurora knock
5:39:31
turn into a rumble here to really make it difficult to play out cuz you have a lot of power with that combo it makes
5:39:38
playing Rumble so difficult and can be a big threat to The Rumble in side Lanes um just so crazy that that combo hasn't
5:39:45
been utilized yet um and we hav seen Roar at all all the way into game three and it's open ginou
5:39:52
first Zin going to be the option and so that Aurora that you're talking about up and available a possibility for BD all
5:39:58
perfect to go towards and that's Rex ey but that's just cuz um referencing his debut
5:40:06
champion in fact got a quadri kill in that game it was very cool back in 2018
5:40:13
2017 18 I think yeah andessa she's the one that snuck through as well and so
5:40:19
cuz looking likely to lock that one in and there it goes that is going to be Top Lane though no ambiguity there given
5:40:25
the fact that we do have a zenzal so bity going to be needed to play some
5:40:31
AP yeah very zyan this is what I was expecting with the Caitlin ban it just felt like zy
5:40:38
if there's a Zyra in the game and you need magic damage you could play canon
5:40:44
in the Top Lane oh that' be weird it would be weird we haven't really seen it uh this year at all um I'm not saying
5:40:51
that's what's going to happen zigs could also be a little bit of magic damage you could poke a zyro Recon out of Lane with
5:40:57
a little bit too and start to get some turret value yeah pretty good value for zyra's ultimate into the zig's ultimate
5:41:03
if you can time it well but there are other problems you're going to have to deal with if that's you're alting I like the zix here I don't mind it and also
5:41:11
works out in the lane as well you sort of just bypass it and you're not too worried and so that is going to be the
5:41:17
lock in here bdd could also theoretically be playing it it is somewhat flexible but uh it's likely
5:41:23
that that one's heading towards the bottom side of the map no Leona to pair with it alist stock going up a whole lot
5:41:30
you could imagine also uh Nautilus pretty good here too nocton is going to
5:41:35
get banned by KT rollster after not locking in themselves Al yeah owner
5:41:42
known for his nocturn the aliser you mentioned is super obvious here wonder what this last jungle ban
5:41:48
assuming it is going to be a jungle ban will end up being here as I mean maai could be a strong
5:41:56
consideration I think maai is pretty strong here for Tan the rumble pretty
5:42:02
well see what they do decide to take away has sichani even been looked at yet I don't no I think so so Le in going to
5:42:09
be the ban though of course uh that is one of owner's best champions ever it's got a certain skin on it that ukuk was
5:42:16
using earlier in the day there's the Tia that we were talking about before yeah I think Tia makes a lot of sense as a ban
5:42:21
here aror is also another option Nautilus Nautilus okay this is the other
5:42:27
pick they could have just banned away instead going to give some additional safety to BD it works out pretty well on
5:42:32
Zia um because if she uses her ultimate you know you can lo her down or you can get her out with it it's also somewhat
5:42:39
difficult to time but I think smash will be able to to work that out but that gets locked in leaving the zigs flex
5:42:47
still as a possibility but again unlikely as vgo looking like owner wants
5:42:53
to opt into here vgo and Rumble has been a tried andrue setup for so long just
5:42:59
simply because rumble's ult damage is so high that you could just blow somebody up and then transform into oh it's
5:43:05
Pantheon okay of the month man yeah Lucid debuting this one a little bit earlier and Aurora
5:43:12
makes it to fifth pick game three on blue side I really like this draft here
5:43:18
for T1 it's going to take a lot to convince me that that KT rollster end up with a better one zigs made me sorry
5:43:24
fizz made me so excited Fizz and zigs in the same game that confused the heck out of me Swain's also fun don't like Swain
5:43:32
I do like bdd on syndra I don't like Swain I love SW Swain's great and it's noxian themed
5:43:40
that's what we're about and Bessa and Swain we are getting all the way to the top of noxis right now Swain is so
5:43:47
incredibly vulnerable though I find in a lot of these uh Team fights and the rumble ultimate as well as Aurora's Gap
5:43:55
like not Gap closer whatever the opposite her weirding is going to give her some distance right where she can play around him really well and in team
5:44:01
fights and then side Lanes I the Swain is is constantly going to be a potential
5:44:06
uh collapse Target he doesn't offer a ton of s Side Lane power to to empower the zigs and set up getting turrets off
5:44:12
the map now what he is going to offer though is a lot of power in desah cuz he's very sticky if he can actually
5:44:18
continue to to build his ult up and stay on top of her he has CH can ult but he's just still there you know he's still threatening you and in longer fights if
5:44:25
he can actually get online he is strong there but it's so difficult to pull off he can set up some some really nice
5:44:31
never moves and maybe snowball some early team fights KT fans praying for the victory but I I uh I'm going to have
5:44:38
to lean very heavily towards the both in incredibly robust and Incredibly meta strong Champions that T1 have on their
5:44:45
side even like these days I'm not as big of a Zia anti as I used to be in Fearless one of the best options I think
5:44:51
T1 could have gone for here yeah no and it was it was seen a mile off right you see that Caitlyn ban and you're like
5:44:56
well they probably want zyan and they're going to get it the only thing that's a bit of a question mark I guess is the
5:45:02
pantheon but we've seen that that's already worked pretty impressively well
5:45:07
uh by Lucid not by Barrel um but but Lucid definitely did find some success here on the side of KT looking a bit
5:45:13
more experimental we see how it does go as we jump onto the rift for the final game of
5:45:18
the first Telecom War of the lck cup
5:45:29
[Music] 2025 all right KT fans pretty loud here
5:45:36
and zinzow actually really like that zenzel skin because it it matches ambessa and her theme so the top jungle
5:45:42
Synergy working out well here for KT T1 on the other side like you mentioned I mean these are just some really good
5:45:50
Champions tried and true you know very safe very you know easy to set up
5:45:56
compositionally like owner stuns somebody you've got feathers for that you've got an equalizer for that you do
5:46:03
have a nautilus to um you know at least get a feather storm out from smash things like this we've seen lens make it
5:46:09
work very well into zers as T1 big Ward here yeah this is owner face checking
5:46:17
and the bomb does come on through as he gets pulled back by the never move there is the hook Landing as well the rest of T1 will turn up see who's going to win
5:46:24
out as far as Summoner spells are concerned no one actually blowing any just yet as carrier diving forward the
5:46:30
flash out from CZ going to be that first one never move on to two no one's dead just yet though smash laying down all of
5:46:36
the feathers owna so close to dead this battle for the Raptors is nutty as car's
5:46:42
going to get hooked but unable to get pulled through and bdd doesn't find that never move we're 2 minutes in I mean minions are clashing in mid so some of
5:46:48
these low health bars are really going to hurt the fact that owner has to back here and took his shield uh at level one
5:46:54
is really going to slow down his clear massively I mean he can't really even overstate how bad of a position this is
5:46:59
and also a never is going to land here on the faker yeah as well level one this way oh yeah way going to have to flash
5:47:05
that one oh no it's game one over again unacceptable absolute disaster man like
5:47:13
that's a face pal well we'll have to see what led up to it but I imagine the news is still not going to be good uh as
5:47:20
thankfully do arm can farm from a really long way away man maybe it's something about the
5:47:25
Top Lane start for way that really uh doesn't work out it's just it's into turret range
5:47:33
that's it's just that simple could have just continued to to Zone and threaten hooks you know you don't always have to
5:47:39
hook you can just stand menacingly and when they come out of tur range then hook them or make them lose experience
5:47:46
instead you made him lose or made him gain um 400 gold and a fe of strength and giving it over to the ad carry which
5:47:52
didn't work out so well in game number one either so little bit of a disaster here for KT to start things off not as
5:47:58
bad as it was last time because do arm is still there and still able to farm from a really long way away can see
5:48:04
using these bouncing bombs quite nicely is elected to go for the pool party skin which is by far the best so he knows
5:48:11
what he's doing perfect trying to go aggressive here onto Doran who's about to overheat but doesn't actually and perfect not going to be
5:48:17
able to get that last minion but that is absolutely fine and so wey needs to chill just a little bit here you can see
5:48:24
yeah a little bit of a crying be so he knows what he's done see whether he can redeem himself as this game goes on this
5:48:30
is not as bad of a situation as it is from game one because like you said zigs can f pretty comfortably it's just not
5:48:36
the start to Lane that you wanted like they had a good start right like aha we have nice pry we're going to Zone you out of oh okay everything we were trying
5:48:42
to do with this early is now gone but it's not like the zigs is out of the game but you lost part of your really
5:48:49
big win in the draft where okay they went Z Recon we go zigs we get a nice edge here follow the lane swap
5:48:54
everything's great oops uh and now we are like okay well zigs will still be relevant um and they got first blood but
5:49:01
it's okay oh perfect dashing around doing some ambessa things but that's just both of them staying on pretty
5:49:09
similar Health totals both of them beaten through both or their potions but
5:49:14
uh perfect does have a biscuit still available it's crazy to watch an actual like Top Lane match up though like we
5:49:20
don't see those too often I know and it's in the bottom Lane yeah same with the like you know 2v2 top side we almost
5:49:27
got to watch it but not really no uh teleport here from Doran BD is laning
5:49:34
really well against the Aurora I thought this was going to be a match up that not that he was going to struggle in but it was going to be tough to to really have
5:49:39
any sort of control in but the level one G him a little bit of extra Edge yep stacking the power of the Sith lightning
5:49:46
as F does land that combo and that is going to make B's life a little bit more difficult should be a to hit that
5:49:52
demonic Ascension relatively soon though as man like Swain so cool now uh
5:49:59
since like the the visual update yeah just looks rad it's got so many birds and animals all over the place vision of
5:50:06
Empire Landing actually pretty nice but uh the answering damage from Faker is also very nice skin is just
5:50:11
so I don't know like it's Ned Stark if Ned Stark had like lightning
5:50:17
hands and like could use magic uh it's what I imagine like uh what's what's her
5:50:23
name from Frozen Elsa yeah it's what I imagine her dad would look like oh that's that I I'm behind you on that one
5:50:31
I don't know if her dad is like in the second movie or anything like a flashback cuz I don't actually know I only saw the first ones I think I yeah I
5:50:37
I don't remember the second one but I kind like I've been burned by so many sequels Atlas across the last few years
5:50:44
that like as much as I loved Frozen I thought it was one of the coolest movies I'd seen at the time when it came out I was like wow like you know they still
5:50:50
got it I was like nah I'm not watching to man there's no way you never should I think um we all saw Lion King too we
5:50:56
were like well yeah Toy Story is the uh the exception not the rule yes uh as his Austin Powers I I think also to to a
5:51:03
certain extent but it's a little bit different as okay smash diving on forward carrier is going to look for dockon doesn't quite get a good flash
5:51:09
out but they do manage to get the Summoner spell in trade for just carrier's two Summoner spells cu's going
5:51:15
to be taking down this Dragon though as the grubs are collected on the top side so it's a trade of grubs for Dragon but
5:51:21
also they have this dive set up here potentially with owner no wave though just yet so it's going to be enough time
5:51:27
to crash or before this crashes for them to get away but means they're going to lose Farm bdd wants to come over here
5:51:32
and make an impact I just oh okay well way is going to get back to the the turret because do he can teleport in
5:51:38
they do manage to claim themselves a plate as wey now wanting to create some
5:51:44
space here vision of vampire get some information about where smash isn't teleport will get the zigs over really
5:51:50
nice pressure relieve there from bdd just kind of roams up and then goes back down he doesn't have to get a kill to
5:51:56
get them out of there and that was pretty huge cuz you know duck on lost some farm from that but it could have
5:52:02
been much worse could have been Dove good play from owner to come up there and threaten that pulls B out of the lane re relieves some
5:52:09
pressure from Faker but I think it was the right call from bed just good League of Legends All Around Here in that moment actually just a much slower start
5:52:16
than what we've seen I mean the chaos does tend to happen a little bit later on uh between these two squads so we'll
5:52:23
just have to see right now it is first Blood going over to T1 very early as wey had his little moment see who manages to
5:52:30
get that first turret blood and who gets these objectives so far it's a trade one for one dragons being the priority for
5:52:37
KT T1 being able to get towards those grubs I wonder whether KT will put a little bit more priority on denying six
5:52:44
grubs because we've seen like some teams just don't care other teams put a lot of
5:52:49
priority on it I feel like it has been very valuable though especially if you do have this ambessa that wants to be in side Lanes things like this what I'm
5:52:55
concerned about with uh KT for objectives is sure they got the first dragon but this zigs is really behind
5:53:02
the eight ball like he's significantly behind on Farm um obviously the first Blood going over to smash isn't going to
5:53:07
help his gold uh deficit either and unlike shinha owner can be kind of
5:53:14
anywhere with his Starfall so you know T1 can threaten to trade an objective and then actually collapse really
5:53:20
quickly they can look like they're outnumbered they can find any sort of flank angle they want to if duck thinks he's safe in the backline he's really
5:53:25
not you know so much flexibility in T's composition even Smash and play aggressively cuz he's Z and he can get
5:53:32
out of Dodge if he needs to and then owner can ult in peel for him there's a lot of really cool ways that T1 can Team
5:53:38
fight around these early objectives and the zigs isn't going to be as relevant in those fights early as the Zia is and
5:53:44
carrier maybe set something up here now cuz is nearby they got to control wood
5:53:49
and cuz being close means that we might not see that grand sta for like you were talking about the man Drop from uh
5:53:57
Ona of course has just come online range isn't exactly that massive but I think
5:54:03
he would have been close enough quickly enough because in the area not going to be happening Faker going to be able to
5:54:08
grab his first plate as we comes in and isn't able to secure that minion
5:54:13
unfortunately as now we've got Drake spawning in 1 and a half minutes but it is the grubs that are on people's minds
5:54:20
or at least hopefully they are as we might get our first Skirmish of the game with multiple people outside of that
5:54:26
level one which was crazy yeah I was going to say I think that one was really uh the first but nobody really ended up
5:54:32
getting a huge Advantage out of that small Advantage for KT but anything especially what happened way moments
5:54:38
later as we see a group towards the top side cuz on the other hand looking like
5:54:44
he maybe wanted to try to punish this Rumble but Doran does have teleport will be able to join perfect you can say the
5:54:49
same thing owner can come in at kind of any Angle now these post six for the
5:54:55
second grub fight so this is a very very tricky fight to play out for KT Swain is
5:55:01
strong in these early skirmishes as long as he can run his ult but that's always the question isn't it with Swain perfect
5:55:08
is really having to play defensively you can see the amount of vision that T1 has
5:55:14
in this bottom Lane is kind of nutty Doran going to cancel his back as the grubs do spawn me he won't be able to
5:55:19
reset in time to get over here if they do want to fight this equalizer could be important as when becomes lightning not
5:55:24
going to connect neither does the never move but the hook is going to be there they do get on top of carrier who does get the quickness off smash taking a lot
5:55:31
of damage Grand Starfall does bring him in the demon flare available for bdd is because staying alive for so long
5:55:38
doesn't have Flash though so he is going to die B just trying to do his best to get a kill anywhere and it straight up
5:55:46
doesn't work that was a complete collapse from KT and T1 should be able to grab themselves some extra grubs I
5:55:53
mean Cara just totally baited them as well like he's just standing there making it look like he's made a mistake
5:55:58
and he actually sets up with the the fake out into the re-engage there from owner so beautifully pops his ult as
5:56:04
well even going to get a demolish on the mid turret then go with his lovers duel back to base are you know he's he's
5:56:11
definitely feeling very good about himself here in this third and final game it's a four to zero now as look at
5:56:17
this K Dodges the hook but he's just still standing here like oh yeah engage on me I might be vonner bomb definitely
5:56:23
not a slippery Recon they can get out of almost any situation oh hook him and he sets up the charm gets the knock up goes
5:56:29
back to smash sets up the feathers and then boom in goes antheon with the man Drop and then Baker drops his ultimate
5:56:35
on every one the problem with SW too in these types of skirmishes is if you're not winning it you're not getting out
5:56:41
either you know a lot of mid laners can go well nope I guess we lost this one but I'm piecing not Swain two kills go
5:56:47
to the pantheon there in this exchange K great positioning there great punish smash following up well owner following
5:56:53
up well and KT five grubs given over 2 T1 oh they would would actually no they
5:57:01
won't that's six should be six but T1 the last one up still I think they may have just left one in the pit uh perhaps
5:57:09
yeah I guess I I think that's actually the case well Mountain Drake going to be up and available Earth Wind and Fire an
5:57:15
opportunity here if we get another infernal Soul kind of nuts um T1 should be able to get this I
5:57:22
think they got six by the way I think this just bugged cuz they have two fats of strength right on the objectives all right yeah so they have to have got all
5:57:28
they to that's the the two that they manage to get this is going to be Feats of Strength if they do manage to secure
5:57:33
this uh KT have information Mega Inferno bomb could actually just be
5:57:38
thrown in to see whether he can steal it away but they don't have the information there it goes do is waiting for it but
5:57:44
uh waiting a little bit too long he just juggling yeah yeah I can't see the um grubs on any of the T1 players and
5:57:50
they're clicked on either on the bottom left where they normally show so bizarre what's going on I'm pretty sure they
5:57:55
have six though if you're watching at home that's what I'm assuming because otherwise the Feats of Strength just
5:58:01
would not be there and you can see now that the boots are looking a little bit cooler than the other way much evidence
5:58:06
to suggest that they have all six grubs I would say at this point um it's Elementary my dear Atlas yeah we do not
5:58:14
we don't actually need Sherlock by the way Sherlock so it's it's fine we we've confirmed it everything's a okay and now
5:58:21
level n h just going to have to go back home and you can see the money is just
5:58:26
all T1 favored and I feel like I I saw what KT were angling for right with this
5:58:32
draft I just don't know whether now it's ever going to be got to get off the ground you know yeah no
5:58:39
I I I to be honest I kind of didn't really see it smash really wants his red buff and he will be a to get it he will
5:58:44
get it he's just got to stick his hand like kind of over the pit real quick and then he'll absorb it I I don't really
5:58:50
like the Swain pick here now the other off option he was looking at potentially was the syndra which has similar problems what about the Fizz the fizz
5:58:57
fizz would have been sick it would have been exciting I don't know if it would have been good it would have another
5:59:03
threat for the Z shark Umar sharks are cool they are so cool maybe it's because
5:59:09
I'm Australian I just like sharks more I don't know yeah Shark Week probably isn't a special for you guys is
5:59:15
it I think that's just a weak yeah but you know like in America there's this thing where it's like it's shark weak
5:59:21
it's definitely not a marketing scheme to get people to watch more Discovery Channel um but like in Australia guys
5:59:27
like it's shark week every week are you in a coastal city and in fact most of them uh tend to be uh as it
5:59:34
turns out I wouldn't be surprised if there was like sharks in the desert in the center with laser beams on their heads
5:59:40
like Austin Powers I thought it was like Dune you know they just swimming around in the sand kind of like Rex eye I I I
5:59:47
think the Syra the pick that he considered would have had similar problems at like great for engage but
5:59:52
doesn't really set up the zigs incredibly well and you know you don't have consistent damage the Swain fixes the damage problem but is a fairly risky
5:59:58
pick and isn't going to be great into the Aurora and then you know the ambessa is is fine in isolation but can be kind
6:00:04
of tricky into a who's you know knows how to play Rumble really well into a melee match up and Doran kind of he's
6:00:10
he's done that quite a bit he's found a lot of success with that so you can find some threat there maybe in the Sid Lane
6:00:16
if cuz plays through you but he's got to patch some holes elsewhere if you know what I mean especially with our level
6:00:21
one went now I mean it's still a playable game here for KT like the deficit was was there in game two and
6:00:27
they were able to come back this isn't that same style of game though where you can set up a pick just not really I mean
6:00:33
only bdd can maybe pull somebody in with a never move move and then you have a big bomb dropped on their head that could work there's just a lot of get out
6:00:40
of jail freak cards even the pantheon could just put up a shield and be like H I'm fine yeah the pantheon kind of works
6:00:46
very similar to Braum which is uh a little bit scary cuz Braum has found a lot of success so far in the lck cup
6:00:52
Doran Now by himself here in this bottom Lane perfect does have his Eclipse done also a cheeky heck Drinker to keep him
6:00:58
alive in the lane especially when there's double AP that makes a lot of sense and maybe maybe this is the time
6:01:05
right like a riiz is complete like BD has got some utility really does need LeAndre is in a bit of extra damage
6:01:11
before he's really a threat um but he's in the Top Lane Baker is moving down T1
6:01:18
just have so much damage if they do decide to turn and they have decided to turn in comes Doran looking for that
6:01:23
equalizer angle as public execution as they dive in on top of Faker can they actually kill him though the answer is
6:01:28
yes but they'll lose their Nautilus for it cuz has that Crescent guard bdd just
6:01:34
trying to get this demon flare to do some more damage it does do a fair bit off the back end as cuz locks down the
6:01:41
rift Herald and that was a better fight for KT yeah that was you know you could start to see some of the Swain value in
6:01:46
those types of extended exchanges there for bdd everyone for T1 just has to kind of disengage and get away The Equalizer
6:01:53
was pretty good for Dorne it's not leading to any big kills or anything like that but the damage alone makes it really difficult for KT to stick around
6:01:59
and continue the fight we'll be able to stop this back as well oh maybe not flashing on top of bdd the Never Move
6:02:04
does connect but he doesn't want to bring him closer there's the Sith lightning and BD grabs the solo or Doran
6:02:12
dies I don't know what you really want to call it but now we've got Shelly making her way out and she'll get a
6:02:18
charge into this out of turret as well and maybe they'll be able to get themselves a turret yeah um like maybe
6:02:25
we'll call that the curtain of Aon the little wall there that he has that's obscure Vision uh you know he didn't
6:02:32
know and he was like I've got the element of surprise and video was like I'm SW though and you don't quite have
6:02:37
enough damage there and the Never Move connects so he's just waiting for a little bit more Spirit fingers and uh
6:02:43
the spirit fing is W deadly in that one all right so watch Baker get engaged on
6:02:49
here the pantheon ult actually puts owner in a really awkward spot he's like I want to get dunked on I can't quite get access by the time he comes in a lot
6:02:54
of damage has been done The Equalizer like I mentioned really makes it tough for KT to continue to the further Chase
6:03:00
in cuz everyone took a lot of damage from it a little bit of a disjointed fight for k or for T1
6:03:06
over here bdd is first person yeah us us got him got him got him not
6:03:13
too bad self healing of the uh Swain certainly working out here and that was through Oblivion or as
6:03:20
well kind of nutty uh now he's got himself a lost chapter we'll see what be is going to be building here on this
6:03:26
Swain I do love LeAndre I hope he does collect it but wanting to have a bit of added
6:03:32
manner I guess he these small victories for KT add up a little bit getting this next
6:03:39
dragon fight would be a large Victory which would help propel them potentially back into this game bdd does have
6:03:44
teleport so he can be here at a moment's notice needs to catch some critical targets here in order to win this game or win this fight rather and uh dark's
6:03:52
got flash little bit safer he's going to kill this wave out yeah does get some shoes together as well his mer Treads
6:03:59
are allowed him allowing him to book it down towards this dragon fight Dr D and way in the banana B brush we know banana
6:04:06
brush controls so incredibly powerful owner wants to ult the backline but he also wants to stay close to the dragon
6:04:12
so he can secure that Smite yeah there's the never move as Faker takes the turret on the top side immediately teleports in
6:04:17
is now perfect is going to spot the grand Starfall that means it owner going to be moved out of the way of The
6:04:23
Equalizer as well not in position as KT they regroup perfect on that flank angle
6:04:29
wants that public execution and T1 they do not want to risk it I think that's smart vision of ampire does give vision
6:04:36
as cuz almost just blows up me Inferno bomb avoided by everyone yeah that was kind of the
6:04:41
saddest zigal I've ever seen yeah it was not a great one that's just another turret here for T1 so yeah T1 made the
6:04:47
right call don't take a bad fight there just simply back away it's only second dragon here for KT rollster it's not
6:04:53
sole point it's some useful stats for the zigs and for the Swain But ultimately getting a second turret
6:04:59
instead is probably for the best and owner's ult there you know got him into the backline but he was like m I I can't
6:05:06
actually isolate a Target here KT will trade a turret back which is nice it was perfect like being able to spot the
6:05:12
grand starle before the uh the icon actually happened on the ground right because otherwise I think the com the
6:05:18
the combo would have been good enough yeah and and KT because of that spot and because of the rotation they just are
6:05:23
able to kind of warp the fight away from T1 strong points the Aurora engage that
6:05:29
Faker was hoping for and just grab Dragon Play Safe and sit behind the dragon and let Duck's poke kind of do
6:05:35
the work there there and uh I thought that was a really nice reaction there from KT and despite again a huge deficit
6:05:41
for them in this game they really keeping their cool which is really nice to see uh controlling an area is
6:05:48
something that they're pretty good at with this composition it's of course what Swain is sort of built for but you
6:05:53
also have the zigs that has his Minefield you know you can be very frustrating and also farming from a
6:05:59
large distance so not having that out of turret in mid lane is less of a detriment I guess and the Z that's on
6:06:05
two it if she can't actually get into range because of all those threats because of the the Swain because of the
6:06:10
the Minefield because of the threat of you know potentially getting caught by way it doesn't matter how much gold he
6:06:15
has and how many items he has if he can't really get into range to Auto and if KT have pryo on these objectives like they have been able to try to manage to
6:06:21
have in these last two dragons they've taken then it it's still winnable for them despite a gold deficit so let's see
6:06:28
what else they can get done here cuz KT is really surprising me today yeah per
6:06:34
as well um I think is Spidey senses are tingling as he wants to get something in
6:06:39
this brush yeah face checks and unfortunately the Spidey senses weren't tingling in the right direction is cuz
6:06:44
it's going to move on over he is running so fast Mega Inferno bomb will save the top laner of KT nicely done by doc Dar
6:06:51
pretty defensive though won't have that tool as he is also trying to do some face checking please don't um is what I
6:06:56
would say to that as we looks for the hook does not connect it it's crazy we have another infernal Soul by the way
6:07:03
just I mean statistically that's pretty un earth wind in fire though I love that doran's going to get another turret here
6:07:09
I don't think there's any way to answer perfect has TP but isn't going to opt into it and so that's just going to be more gold in the rumble's pocket which
6:07:15
is pushing him closer to that void staff likely could be a crit Bloom but make hone upset so I hope it's staff in this
6:07:22
situation especially considering the Mr that's been built up here by his opposition perfect having that Ma online
6:07:29
now uh for the side lane matchup bdd you can see is you know slowly but surely to
6:07:35
be a threat in terms of getting his items online his riy Mak some kind of this big Bruiser in team fights the
6:07:41
slows make it so difficult to get away from him it's exactly what he wants he wants everyone to be kind of stuck in his ultimate and makes it easier for him
6:07:48
it never moves and stuff like that as well we'll see if uh this next fight here on this next dragon KT can maintain
6:07:54
that same pryo could be on Aon but it'll likely be on this Dragon given the you know fairly even game State even though
6:08:00
T1 have a big gold lead like KT are still winning fights where they're still able to set this up so I'd say T1 aren't
6:08:06
going to throw it all away on an early Aon is on the opposite side of the map of the Dragon so KT also have the
6:08:11
opportunity to potentially try to trade but I want to see if they can maintain PR cuz that is the whole name of the game for these team fights working down
6:08:18
gold like they did that last time yeah I'm wondering so carrier able to dash
6:08:23
its way out of the never move the B did throw at him I feel like carrier has been so good this game as well sole he's
6:08:30
found some amazing quickness angles and the fact that KT were able to actually come out ahead in the the last fight
6:08:36
it's kind of a huge deal um just because he did get so much value still KT just
6:08:42
holding on and they've got a zig's composition that's kind of what they want to do I don't know whether necessarily you'd say that KT like
6:08:48
outscale and it's like it's if you don't manag to do this then you're doomed but
6:08:53
bdd now has his two items complete and it's going to get scarier
6:08:59
and scarier iance is really good for Swain as well so this two item spike is actually pretty good the lack of range
6:09:05
for you know Z and like the fact that Faker needs to kind of be in the thick of things to set up his ultimate means
6:09:11
that there's almost a failinks es type of scenario that KT can set up if they have pryo and so I think that down 4,000
6:09:19
gold they have like 4,000 gold worth of positional advantages and team fight advantages if they can get that pry like
6:09:24
they did on the last dragon and T1 are just not going to mess with that you know they're not going to take a bad fight so they'll try to find gold elsewhere like they did with those
6:09:30
turrets last time around if it's KT having to get to the fight second and show up their engages aren't necessarily
6:09:38
as robust they're more strong defensively oh way is trying to find owner here just puts up the door or the
6:09:43
shield and KZ is going to go in Doran not going to over commit to this one or is he equalizer goes down it's onity and
6:09:50
CZ and now carrier looks for the opportunity gets into that back line the zigs explodes the entire bottom Lane is
6:09:56
just already dead BD doing a fair bit of work but it is not enough cuz trying to
6:10:01
stay alive The Flash does not work and T1 will wipe the floor with
6:10:08
KT yeah you know there's there's very rarely when you make a a color point where you're
6:10:14
like I don't know if they should ever really be the ones to attack when they don't know what's going on it's very rarely a more picturesque example of
6:10:21
something and then it happens right afterwards because owner looks like he's getting caught here and look at how difficult it is to even kill him with
6:10:27
this competition for KT unfortunately there's a wrap around happening right they've now put themselves in no man
6:10:33
land they're now not able to set up that failing cuz they're being attacked from all angles and it's a really nice fault from owner and carer Aon is being taken
6:10:40
in live by T1 after this wipe and like I mentioned before yeah PD he stays on the think of things for a long time he's
6:10:46
very difficult to kill but as they kind of front to back this as as the rest of the team gets peeled apart he can't get
6:10:51
out you know he's opted in he's locked into the fight he he cannot Escape he cannot get away and now it's a 9,000
6:10:58
gold lead plus oton plus Baron yeah um this game is is all but
6:11:06
over here as BD does find a nice never move doran's teleported back though B is going to have to try and hold on to this
6:11:12
inner turret and I just think that it is not going to work do going to turn up
6:11:18
with bared up minions they do survive for a whole lot longer they have any right to is now BD is just going to get
6:11:23
aled by Faker doesn't quite find the combo as The Equalizer is also a little bit weird when there is a flash up and
6:11:28
available carrier just going in because he can I mean carer is teaching KT
6:11:34
rolster a lesson yeah like with some of these baits he set up some of where looks like he's caught he's like no no
6:11:39
no no no you're locked in here with me and it was so face up as well they managed to get it you know second round
6:11:46
on blue side oh man I do think that this draft
6:11:51
it's beautiful from uh T1 not going to lie but it is pretty
6:11:56
telegraphed and KT thought they had an answer but it's just looking like it really is
6:12:01
not I I they're going to hold on here if they can hold on for 90 more seconds
6:12:07
without losing an inhibitor maybe they'll get another fight the problem is that this dragon is up too and T1 just have so many different options and
6:12:14
there's no risk really because they have wings you know they're they're sitting here going well yeah know if you want to if you want to try to collapse on us if
6:12:20
you kill someone in the side like that doesn't matter can you win a dragon fight against us we we have you know the ability to just rejoin like I you can't
6:12:27
win a dragon fight cuz we have Baron buff also like there's just no losing there's another equalizer that comes down as Doom is going to flash into
6:12:33
Faker and just pop like a balloon F just bouncing around his ultimate looking absolutely cool while he does so and T1
6:12:40
they just kill three and they're able to move even further forward perfect has decided that he just wants to try and
6:12:46
take whatever they can but I think he's going to be required back home because there is an invasion as T1 look to take
6:12:53
down their first inhibitor of the game and look for even more maybe they're just done with this game as Doran is
6:12:59
just flashing on top of bdd who just dies oh my God perfect maybe he shouldn't have come home maybe should
6:13:04
have stayed in the Top Lane because this game is over Nexus turret 1 is going to go down Nexus turret 2 is surely to
6:13:11
follow and wey yeah he spent a little bit of time outside of the fountain but I think he wants back in please end his
6:13:17
misery and T1 will acques that is the game three Victory T1 looking way better
6:13:24
than they did in game number two and smash man what a debut yeah it was a
6:13:29
pretty impressive play I'm putting in my comment for him right now oh he's the vote for
6:13:35
om can that makes some sense here um even his uh his Z game his ezal game
6:13:40
absolutely fantastic despite the fact that they lost and KT certainly some things to look at here uh as far as how
6:13:47
they're going to go about uh picking up some wins but I think uh some some identification of some draft issues um
6:13:54
could be coming in for the squad but I don't want to take anything away I think KT's game two was absolutely fantastic
6:14:01
and just weren't able to really uh get off the ground there in uh game number three dor also making up for an awkward
6:14:08
tank Jack performance in game two I think there were some moments of overconfidence from T1 in the series but
6:14:14
I think the core the macro the shot calling from Faker it's all still there smash just felt like a different Cog in
6:14:20
the wheel but accomplished a whole lot I think very impressive debut from him his EZ game was phenomenal haah was set up
6:14:28
well game one you know obviously was set up for Success too and then ran with it you know and his kaisa was the one
6:14:35
Champion that he first mentioned really alongside the Jinx that he feels really comfortable on he showcased that he absolutely is and it was just a
6:14:41
different look from T1 today we don't know what the future is going to hold but I think we what one thing we can all
6:14:47
confident say is this roster has a little bit more depth than we thought coming into this season yeah I would
6:14:53
agree actually uh it was a lot of fun in the end after we got rid of the the Scana mishap in game number one um this
6:15:00
series actually delivered a whole lot you can see smash I think feeling the pressure from this one very relieved
6:15:07
that this is over but honestly job well done my friend absolutely fantastically done in his first game here in the lck
6:15:14
and it's so difficult like this is the hardest team to sub in for in the league like in the world because you are under
6:15:21
so much scrutiny you know so many people their favorite player is Gushi yeah that
6:15:27
guy on the left certainly knows he did it you know and he had the love and support of the fans is oh I don't want
6:15:32
to watch this I really don't want to watch this anymore he had two of those this series I think
6:15:37
he's probably going to get a Stern talking to by score um about his performance and I think honestly Way's
6:15:44
performance in this series uncharacteristic of the player that he is I think a lot of nerves a lot of tension coming to this one it smashes D
6:15:51
it's the Telecom War his first one on the stage and it's it's tough right you got to play well he wants to push those
6:15:57
advantages both times he made an aggressive play to try to get KT further ahead it backfired I I think he probably
6:16:03
walks away from the series learning a lot but he's not going to feel good about it on the team bus ride home no I
6:16:08
would agree and this was one of the fights that looked okay for KT I think largely because doam actually survived
6:16:14
and in every other fight doam was targeted immediately this was very
6:16:20
comical uh speed waits for his Fusion of Empire to do damage before just ending him with the uh Sith lightning but
6:16:27
carrier man every single one of these quickness almost all of them Charming up four people five people and making sure
6:16:36
that all of the damage was able to land the target selection also so much better here for T1 I think you know owner had a
6:16:42
fantastic game one but he played scarner so it's like H that's not K I feel like was probably the second vote for pom
6:16:50
this series though he was the one who set up the poppy punish in game one had some really nice ults there and in this
6:16:56
game like fantastic Recon play baited KT several times but uh I was always going
6:17:01
to vote for smash unless he totally bodged it in this one and guess what he did I mean I you just have to obey the the
6:17:07
YouTube rule you know smash that like button and we absolutely did uh because his performance really really good in
6:17:13
this game and don't expect that those puns are going to slow down as well if he does keep playing and it's like a
6:17:20
sorry not sorry type situation here as yeah T1 finished that one off the amount of damage they did way higher than that
6:17:26
of KT bit surprising that BD was able to do so much because in those fights really didn't look like he was really
6:17:32
able to do anything and I want to shout out like hats off to cuz I think cuz actually had a pretty good performance
6:17:38
today his Wukong game especially yeah that one was very very good but I think there are certain things to look at here
6:17:44
uh and smash is going to pick it up and there is a lot of Ooze from the Korean broadcast but I don't think we're very
6:17:51
surprised at all look at his KDA he's 82 and2 in a loss on an Ezreal where he
6:17:56
looked so phenomenal um throughout the game and looked like he was going to save the game at at times as well took
6:18:03
the gold from a mistake from way in the kaisa game had a great performance there in game one under a lot of pressure
6:18:09
under a lot of scrutiny as you said still as a support of most of the fans here but you know I feel like a lot of players choke under that pressure he
6:18:15
absolutely did not he was thriving and smash looking really really good and I love it you know after you know Reckless
6:18:21
sing singing all of his Praises we now get to hear from him in a pom interview
6:18:26
so let's throw it over to gon for some translation thank you very much for to
6:18:34
post match interview translation joined by Smash the player of the match
6:18:40
today congratulations smash this is your debut match here on the T1 B
6:18:48
roster please give it up for smash one more time everyone first off how are your
6:18:56
feeling I mean today walking to the arena all I was
6:19:02
thinking was I wish I can get but I ended up even getting a p as well
6:19:08
thanks to a great performance and Place coming from my teammates I'm very
6:19:19
great here at l park for the first time weren't you nervous
6:19:25
today when I arrived here at L Park I was not nervous at all so I was like
6:19:31
maybe if I start setting up on the stage computer I would feel I would be feeling nervous and then I didn't feel anything
6:19:38
special so I was like maybe I'm like born this way you know I I don't get the nerves you know I was able to do a great
6:19:45
job today thanks to that and today also told me you know don't get nervous you
6:19:50
know believe in yourself do do whatever you want to do as long as you don't make mistakes you know just play it your way
6:19:58
and thanks to that advice I was able to you know play how I normally play
6:20:06
and you said many times that one of your dreams is actually playing together with
6:20:11
Baker how was it you finally accomplished your dream I cannot even put it in words you know it's
6:20:17
unbelievable because I as a younger player like myself you know I've been
6:20:23
growing up watching Faker pop off and dominating the entire Lola Sports so it was a big honor for me to play together
6:20:30
with him as a teammate what about playing together with K on the bottom
6:20:37
Lane me and K actually got really close you know he really helped me out a lot
6:20:43
you know trying to kind of have a lot of fun to together there he was making a lot of jokes to make me feel comfortable
6:20:48
so thanks to that I was able to not get too
6:20:53
nervous I want to ask you about the drafting as well how did you end up with
6:20:59
those cards well I didn't really get to play a lot of streams together but we
6:21:05
had a very long kind of meeting about our today's pick and band so we had a
6:21:11
lot of Communications on like I want to play this I want to that and we ended up with the draft thing that we played
6:21:20
today overall you were very aggressive in a good way you know you were very proactive as an 8
6:21:26
car how was today I'm very happy with my performance in game three because in
6:21:33
both game one and two I made made a mistake so not the best play that I want to showcase but overall it was a very
6:21:39
decent day for
6:21:44
me today you were able to make a huge debut with amazing performance today
6:21:50
what kind of what kind of a player do you want to become in the future I wish I can become a player that
6:21:58
everyone can remember as one of the best 80 carriers in history I wish I can win
6:22:04
a lot of trophies as well this will be the end the interview
6:22:11
with smash the p on the set of T1 and back to the space and uh one more time
6:22:17
before we go we have the T1 player supporting you here live at low Park anything you want to say to them I
6:22:23
actually told them not to come because it's so pressuring but they insisted still coming but it did actually really
6:22:31
helped you know having their support in the back so I say thank you to my C Bros
6:22:36
that they actually made it here and supported me than you everyone and that was the end of the PO
6:22:43
interview with Smash and back to the space thank
6:22:49
you thank you as always gson for that awesome translation great to hear from
6:22:54
Smash he comes in he's subbing in he's doing a perfect PM interview he's just feeling very comfortable he's like no I
6:23:01
wasn't nervous you know it's crazy he was talking about how you know his dream was to play with Faker when Faker F
6:23:07
first won worlds he was 7 years old no way it's yeah so crazy it's so crazy I
6:23:15
mean this is the next Generation literally it literally is it's kind of insane uh you guys had some thoughts on
6:23:23
the pom and we'll get to see who did pick up the votes we did have a couple of jungle votes actually going over to
6:23:31
owner um which I don't really get after the nly game
6:23:38
the N game really after the game cut that off I mean it's really said for T1
6:23:43
fans that probably it's the last game of owner needle Le
6:23:49
yeah what I will say is that sometimes You' had this habit when you know like when uh youal won the other the other
6:23:56
day when it's like you ignore the bad game maybe they want in with that mindset still I I think smash takes it
6:24:02
but he was also gifted scarner in game one he played well he played a good scarner it's difficult to play a bad
6:24:08
scarner uh unkillable demon Prince any uh you know what he had you know what he
6:24:15
had in that series he had Aura that's all I need to say he had Aura and you could see that you could see that from how we played uh
6:24:21
especially the ezal game I feel like this came to me in the ezal game when there's so many situations he was escaping from on low HP uh and you think
6:24:28
back to when Faker debuted uh and got that solo kill on the Le and that's true
6:24:34
yeah that's the sort of AA you see in in your debut when you're an alltime yeah uh for me personally uh coma doesn't
6:24:41
need to explain why he brought up in lck because we could definitely see that you
6:24:47
know uh from the draft the whole draft plan was got changed just by him you
6:24:52
know they are picking up the kaisa they're first picking asreal so so many things got changed so and also the
6:24:59
performance as well so we don't need any explanations the play spoke for itself yep it really did he had Aura you know
6:25:05
as you guys are both kind of saying we got to see his debut was a smashing success uh he didn't put Nigel
6:25:12
Thornberry voice there I'm very I'm very sad about that but I did a little tribute he's not as diligent as conic
6:25:18
Clay is with the uh stage directions I know come on dodging everything
6:25:23
slow it's like a Korean meme it it kind of feel like an like an anime like an
6:25:29
animore yeah when you you dodge everything you like you know trash talk and you're like you're so slow you know
6:25:35
yeah like the Matrix where he like Dodges the bullets uh smash the hearts of the fans in the best way I gu you're
6:25:42
a KT [Laughter] fun yeah maybe crush the the hearts
6:25:48
could have been better there uh owner do whatever you want to do he did an it uh
6:25:55
I don't think so I don't think I don't think he's allowed to do that anymore
6:26:00
hey you had two good games you had two good games you know you had two we just forget the ital that is true again it's
6:26:05
out of mind all right we do have I don't know which hun to choose this is about both
6:26:12
Doran and owner are named kjun and uh he wanted to choose one of those and not
6:26:18
smash for some reason Pony's on the cast he was one of the guys that went for owner yeah he's fine I'm going to play
6:26:24
him after uh understandably slow so because
6:26:29
uh yeah that was all smash all the way from our side but uh let's talk about
6:26:35
the game a little bit and how this all started off so this invade no one actually ends up going down in it but
6:26:40
what's really important is both carrier and smash been all of the health potions and smash is still half HP and normally
6:26:47
when you're playing into zigs it's a really rough match up to be in later in the game but like in the early Lane you can have some pressure level one but
6:26:54
being low already is so bad and then this critical eror way going under the tower it turns what was a winning bot
6:27:01
Lane situation from for KT to a completely losing one and it was such a disaster cuz everything was so good for
6:27:07
zigs until that moment all you need to do is just standing by and do nothing you know but he ruined everything
6:27:14
literally you know they have no potions half HP you land a couple more zigs qes and the lane is just over they have to
6:27:22
recoil it was rough I mean that was uh one of the mistakes that unfortunately we kind of had to highlight or low light
6:27:28
in this case but it really did get T1 off on a great footing as we move into the second highlight here I mean just
6:27:34
look the moves and look the Jes you know like after he Dodges all the skill shots he still stays in and after that I mean
6:27:41
he's tankier enough to tank the damage and look at the jumps from the pantheon
6:27:46
as well like everything kind of Started from the carryer yeah and you know you have the panon you can come in follow up but also the charm that car was able to
6:27:54
get allowed smash to line up a big route he gets another big blade caller there and it just feels like everyone on T1 on
6:28:00
the same page which you know it's what we typically expect from this team but when you put a new piece to the equation
6:28:06
didn't catch them off guard at all they they really felt like they slot together beautifully I mean you know what's
6:28:11
surprising at this point is because like we see smashy Smash playing and it
6:28:17
doesn't feel like the rookie players actually coming into the lck like being nervous it's just I'm just seeing smash
6:28:25
just smashing someone you know like just like a veteran player so it's quite surprising that he's not nervous at all
6:28:30
the only time he look slightly nervous was in the interview at no point in the games did he looked nervous in his gameplay and also on the red Buff when
6:28:37
he tried to pick that up what was that like that but anyways he's such a nice
6:28:43
guy and also uh they got a new plan new draft plan as well so everything looks
6:28:48
really good with him imagine you know how strong they can be when they have Guma back in and they have Smash in one
6:28:54
game another game you know when Fearless goes best of five you're going to need a lot of choices and maybe a lot of
6:29:00
players as we will take a look at the final highlight this was really the uh the nail and the coffin on this one but
6:29:06
it was just such a beautiful uh Team fight we had to highlight it yeah ker didn't got a vote but L at his
6:29:12
positioning and also the plays I think uh he made all the plays for the smash and that's why smash could land all the
6:29:19
skill shots for the enemy team I think it was really great and clean I think you get so many games of things like you
6:29:25
know kalista support and stuff from carrier uh you kind of think of him as being that player can bring out those
6:29:30
picks or like luck support and then you see him on a raan and you just like yeah he he he can do that too you know I
6:29:36
think his raon was super clean in this game and obviously I think smash deserved the P but carrier definitely
6:29:42
shown up in that match well for KT side I think they really need to fix
6:29:48
something on their top and support specially because at game one you gave him kante giving up aan right for the
6:29:55
better match up on the top side but he got solo killed by Doan and also uh in the boat Lane we cannot really say bad
6:30:02
things towards duckdown because his support is not playing the game properly so I feel like they really need to uh
6:30:08
fix this uh critical issue and then we can see something from the KT side because we saw at game two like they
6:30:15
were playing so good together on the mid jungle as well and it it's kind of sad cuz we've seen the members who've come from uh KT Challengers play well and we
6:30:23
has played better than this in challenges but it just feels like maybe the nerves are getting to him and it
6:30:28
just feels like just blunders it's not like he's just actively constantly doing bad things but like he just makes the
6:30:34
mistakes where he's like oh I see a window over steps I felt like with both the nless and the ra game it was in lane
6:30:39
it was trying to step too far and I think he just needs to calm down and not put such high expectations on himself
6:30:45
it's like I need to win the lane level one yeah I mean that's the difference between Smash and way because way was
6:30:50
really good at chall's league but smash was not that in that level you know when he was in T2 he was not really playing
6:30:58
good but I think he's kind of built different I guess yeah I think there were a lot of high hopes for KT and
6:31:03
they're not really delivering so far here at the lck cup so we'll have to see if they can actually do that as time
6:31:09
comes along but let's take a look at the standings because for now they're at the bottom of group Elder thankfully for
6:31:15
them they're in a group with a lot of teams that are winning so at least they're not going to get knocked out just for being fifth place in a winning
6:31:22
group but this is a win for group Baron and it's not over yet um there is still
6:31:29
a chance for group Baron to actually catch up in which case that KT would
6:31:34
uh potentially actually be in some danger tomorrow's matchups H life Esports up against steeve plusia that
6:31:41
one is going to be in Omega Banger and then we'll have to wait and see if the DM freaks can take down jji who have been looking pretty shaky nowadays yeah
6:31:48
I mean the fact that bro manag to take them down and bro did obviously perform really well but also does kind of make
6:31:53
you question the form they're in I think that first match up though should be uh an absolute Banger I mean d Plus have
6:31:59
looked so good but H that roster is just stuck yeah after week one I literally said ji is going to win the lck cup but
6:32:06
I think now there are so many good underdogs and you never know what what's going to happen if F draft so it's still
6:32:13
the Four Points difference between those teams but you got to go like there's there are so so many matches still left
6:32:19
eternal battle of The Underdogs against the overdogs that is true generally the overdogs come out on top unless you're
6:32:26
ax and you see the lines and you just know that it's going to be H life Esports that one time unlike everybody
6:32:33
else uh he definitely wanted to get that mention in so when he was talking about it had to mention it for him but guys
6:32:38
we're done here on today's day of the LSK cup we will be starting two hours earlier tomorrow for the weekend matches
6:32:44
