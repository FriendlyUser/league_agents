**Match Analysis**

The series between Nongshim and BRO was a rollercoaster of momentum shifts, but Nongshim ultimately secured a 2-0 victory. Here's a more detailed look:

**Game 1:**

*   **Early Game:** BRO had a strong start, securing early grubs, a first blood, and a dragon. They focused on early aggression and objective control with their Nocturne composition. Lehends' Elise support pick was impactful early with it's burst damage and engage.
*   **Mid Game:** Nongshim started to find their footing, using Kingen's Rumble to control team fights and Fisher's smolder started to come online. The game featured constant back-and-forth swings. Both teams had trouble stringing together a dominant period.
*   **Late Game:** Despite a strong effort from BRO, Nongshim's scaling composition, especially Kingen and Fisher's scaling damage, allowed them to eventually pull ahead. BRO's attempt to dive the backline was ultimately unsuccessful, and Nongshim leveraged their superior damage output to close out the game.
    *   **Key Factors:**
        *   Kingen's consistent damage output on Rumble.
        *   Lehends' Elise providing early pressure and engage.
        *   Fisher's Smolder scaling into the late game as an insurance policy.
        *   BRO's inability to capitalize on early advantages and protect their backline effectively.

**Game 2:**

*   **Early Game:** Both teams adopted scaling team compositions, with BRO focusing on a heavy poke composition (corki, Ezreal) and Nongshim picking Gangplank. The early game was a bit messy, with both teams making mistakes in their rotations. The jungle was fairly contested.
*   **Mid Game:** BRO started to gain a small advantage, controlling objectives and putting pressure on towers, but Nongshim were able to secure an early adakan. 
*   **Late Game:** The teams traded objectives and kills, with the gold being relatively close, before Nongshim was able to secure Baron and Elder, allowing them to close out the game due to the immense scaling of kingan and Fisher. BRO could not effectively deal with Nongshim's carry threat and were ultimately overrun.
    *   **Key Factors:**
        *   Kingen's strong Gangplank performance and scaling.
        *   Fisher's late game damage and ability to avoid being caught.
        *   BRO's inability to deal with the pressure from Nongshim's scaling carries.

**Performance Analysis**

*   **Nongshim RedForce:**
    *   **Kingen:** Was the standout performer in both games, delivering consistent damage and carrying team fights. His Rumble and Gangplank plays were instrumental in their victories.
    *  **GIDEON** : Played a supportive role for Kingen, and got caught out a few times. Made some good engages.
    *   **Fisher:** Had some early struggles with positioning but scaled well in both games, providing significant damage and pressure. In the first game, the smolder was an insurance policy and in the second, played a more supportive damage carry role.
    *   **Jiwoo:** Was the target of much of BRO's aggression and could not scale into a significant damage threat.
    *   **Lehends:** Had a high impact early game in game one on Elise, providing pressure and engage.

*   **ORION BRO:**
    *   **Morgan:** Struggled throughout the series, particularly in the early games, where he fell behind in lane and was consistently targeted by dives.
    *   **HamBak:** Made a few good plays, but could not stop the snowballing of Nongshim's carries.
    *   **Clozer:** Had a good individual performance in both games, playing Aurora, but his team could not capitalize on the individual advantages he could get, and could not snowball his lead.
    *   **Bull:** Had a decent but not exceptional performance, and did not have the opportunity to play his favored kalista.
    *   **Hype:**  Was not a factor and did not play.

**How Close Were the Matches?**

While the final scores were 2-0, the series was not a complete stomp. The games were characterized by:

*   **Momentum Swings:** Both games featured multiple lead changes and periods where either team looked dominant.
*   **Messy Fights:** The team fights were often chaotic, with players making aggressive dives.
*   **Individual Outplays:** Both teams had individual outplays and big moments that helped them gain temporary advantages.

However, Nongshim's stronger scaling compositions, and Kingen's and Fisher's carry ability, allowed them to capitalize on these moments and pull ahead at the end. BRO's lack of consistency and difficulty in protecting their backline ultimately cost them the series. In short:

*   **Game 1:** Had the appearance of a stomp, but was a close game until the end.
*   **Game 2:** Was very close until Nongshim pulled ahead in the final fights.

**Overall Performance**

*   **Nongshim RedForce:** Showed improved team synergy and scaling potential, particularly with Kingen leading the charge. Lehends' unorthodox picks were impactful in the early game.
*   **ORION BRO:** Continued to show their volatile style of play. Failed to adapt their style or protect their carries. Still have much improvement to show.
