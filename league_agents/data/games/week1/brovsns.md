51:30
are moving over to the Bros and at first I was like this feels weird but after
51:35
witnessing what they were doing at the kesper cup I think that this is exactly where closer belongs oh yeah I mean get
51:41
this guy fed get this guy ahead UK's return as well super hyped for me he's
51:46
had you know a really tough time over in the LPL he played on Thunder talk wasn't able to find a lot of success there but
51:52
despite having a sub 50% win rate he's actually got big laning stats he's ahead at CS he's ahead at gold at 15 minutes
51:59
on average he had a pretty good performance individually in the mid lane even though his team didn't have great results so I think a a player that
52:06
people should look out for even those results recently haven't really said as much and then man talking about the
52:12
bottom Lane for bro Paulo has really stepped into his own with hype joining
52:17
the team and they look like a completely different Duo than anything we saw from them last year and then the main man of
52:24
the day I mean lazy fi coming in pick picked up P just last night one MVP
52:31
playing for Challengers didn't interview on stage they brought his translater there he had a lot to say about his
52:36
communication he's picked up a lot of Korean he calms in Korean with his team speaks English when he there's a word he
52:42
doesn't know he said the most exciting part about living in Korea now he's been in Korea for a year as in Vietnam they
52:47
don't really have winter they don't have cold weather and he said it's been such a joy to experience the cold weather here in hey I can relate to that
52:54
entirely uh 2018 was a very interesting time for me I had to buy a jacket for the very first time in my life and I
53:00
assume lazy field had an a very similar experience getting the big jacket is
53:05
just such like it's like a Coming of Age moment is what it feels like um when you are here in career cuz it does get
53:11
extraordinarily cold today is an example of that but it is now time to put him to the test in the lck kind of crazy that
53:18
like we were watching him yesterday in Challenger and now immediately brought up thankfully he had a good experience
53:24
because if it was a bit of a rough timeing Challenger yesterday then this could be a very different story however lazy field even from what
53:30
we saw previously in the the kesper cup where he spent the entirety of the time T he didn't play at all um he looked
53:37
pretty good so we're going to be diving into the draft here and of course big change is going to be that this is
53:42
fearless no one has any fear you're not allowed to be scared if we sense fear on the stage you will be removed
53:48
immediately so while there are no changes to the first draft in that no Champions have been played so there's no
53:55
additional banss things like first pick become so incredibly important because you get to not only have that B1 champ
54:01
that you want that you want to prioritize but you can deny your opponent from playing it throughout the entirety of the series as well by just
54:07
locking it in and I wonder how much strategy is going to come from like if we pick this Champion then our draft for
54:15
the next game is going to be so much better and investor three like this buying yourself space for a game two and
54:21
then having even more for a game three could be something to play into but we haven't necessarily SE too much of that
54:27
it's more about let's just pick the good stuff that we can find and see if we can make a composition as yeah um yeah and
54:34
also double lazy field bands feels very respectful you to see that he's played in Challengers as well so scarner has
54:41
been the Talk of the Town has been basically banned completely in the LPL
54:47
and has been played a ton in Challengers or banned every time um when he's left available he's install locked he is left
54:53
open in this case with the Aurora ban that's where I'm expecting we're going to go y that will be the case here for hok's
54:59
debut and now you know with the ban on the azir I wonder what UK has in mind
55:05
here the a ad carry pool especially in terms of early bullies has been thinned out so things like the Ezreal do become
55:11
a little bit more appealing here potentially for lazy field Victor is one of UK's old favorites he played a ton in
55:17
the lck and that's also a champion that's gotten recently buffed yeah it's actually kind of insane that you know we
55:23
remember him you know back in 2018 saving KT um bringing them to Worlds against
55:29
Griffin and he was playing this Champion a whole bunch back then and it is going to be coming out once more the Cori going to be locked in here for lazy Feld
55:35
as well I believe this is one of the Champions that he played a little bit um inup he also got a with it yesterday as
55:43
well so he's he's very proficient at the champion closer he loves his melee mids
55:50
and if you've watched this guy over the last few years you know that it's no surprise he'll be locking in Yon State
55:56
yon is in right now very strong pick here and we'll see Sani taken on the
56:02
other side not any Synergy built up for Perma Frost just yet in this draft however yeah that uh worries me a little
56:08
bit of course sponge is very confident on the Sani was all last year um but hopefully we do see something coming uh
56:15
from somewhere else I mean at least a support that is somewhat La would be great can help set up gravity well for
56:21
Victor stuns as well so you can kind of lock people in there set up a secondary stun with the ultimate ambessa feels
56:28
like a no-brainer here as that's kind of the missing piece for DRX at this moment in time and has some pretty good cnergy
56:34
with sedani on the side of DX you just want to stop any sort of pushing bullying Lane for this corki in the
56:40
bottom side so we'll see both kaisa who is very strong into the corki and the
56:45
zigs that has incredible power early on taken off the board and then JX you
56:50
definitely the biggest one that sticks in your mind in terms of available Champions here that works well with Sani
56:55
what should be A N I just I just feel like it's going to be Nar for Rich um in the end hype what is he going to be
57:01
picking up here because of course the two AP choices that you going to be going towards have been banned away we were seeing this all throughout the
57:07
kesper cup and then uh immediately afterwards as well try and eliminate some of the more common Mages from the
57:13
bottom Lane can theoretically just play anything like a cnra if you feel like it but hype is more of that stock standard
57:20
I'm going to play an ad carry kind of guy Mis Fortune is going to come in re's been performing incredibly well now this
57:26
is cool cuz you get to see what the bottom Lane is yeah you blinded the uh Leona but now maybe you're like how
57:31
immobile is that bottom Lane do I want to play something like Camille which has been popping up a little bit here and works decently well with the Sani
57:38
something that also gives you some good s lane power or is it just going to be the Nar you mentioned try to bully the
57:43
cassan out of the lane pretty good into scarner as well Jace has been cropping back up it's one of Rich's old favorites
57:49
and he is going to lock it in here so a lot of poke but there's a lot of front line to break through I think a very
57:55
risky decision to go for Jace considering that massive front line that bro have online already yeah and I think
58:01
that Derrick's going to really have to give Rich some attention in the early stages of the game because if if Morgan
58:07
even just goes even for like the first bit of the game I don't think that uh Jace is ever getting through this
58:13
cassant especially if huk is anywhere near like those health bars are absurdly large that is just a lot of tankiness
58:20
that they have available feel like uh okay Savings Bank pron have come out of this draft feeling pretty powerful but
58:26
there is certainly still a lot of expressiveness on the DRX side UK coming
58:31
back with one of his favorite Champions rich like you say full Comfort there on the top side of the map and sponge was
58:36
the sichani guy so I guess it's Comfort versus comp to start off this LC I think
58:41
that's a great way to put it and I do think that the Simplicity of the composition we have for DRX is definitely there there's a lot of burst
58:48
damage and single Target CC so the Leona Sani setup can be quite good when you
58:53
follow up with an accelerated shock blast if you can find the thread the needle into that Misfortune or try to
58:58
punish her when she's channeling her ultimate there's definitely some things that you can find success with in this trap but I think it is going to be very
59:04
challenging against a team that's already got so much Synergy as the Bros do and when you consider the roles that
59:11
Morgan and hok are going to be playing in terms of front line they have to be positioned very well because Misfortune
59:16
is otherwise going to be a very vulnerable Target here I would agree just have to see how it is all going to
59:21
come together because there is so much CC the amount of hold them in position so I can kill them with with my cone um
59:27
is very large here for hype I think that guy could certainly be getting some kills this game unless lazy feel has
59:33
something to say about it the very first time a Vietnamese player has played in the lck let's get into
59:49
it all right here we are ladies and gentlemen onto the rift for the very first game of the lck cup and yes the
59:55
very first time we're seeing an import onto the L Park stage it is kind of
1:00:02
insane you mentioned like the caveat that we have to always put down is the fact that CLG euu played um sort of in
1:00:09
the lck I guess in quotation marks in Champions yeah yeah in Champions back in the day back in 2012 um they're in the
1:00:16
final casted by double lift mol trap and Valdez uh which we always get reminded
1:00:21
of uh cuz it's just very strange that was of course 13 years ago now yeah it's
1:00:26
been a long time we'll have a lane swap in our first game of the year here but
1:00:32
it will be matched so neither team will actually get an advantage oo that's called Australian style yeah we are just
1:00:39
making things upside down uh right now it looks like DRX do not have all the information as to where hype and po are
1:00:46
yeah Rich is hiding behind his turret likewise will be Morgan and now they'll
1:00:52
reveal each other sweeper down for Paulo yep well it's uh I'll raise you
1:00:57
your uh Lane swap with another Lane Swap and therefore nullify the lane swap so I
1:01:03
guess it's theoretical but it's not quite working out and of course there have been a few changes here haven't there wolf as far as how Lane swaps are
1:01:09
going to happen the amount of protection is not quite there as much the top side uh turret protection for plates has been
1:01:15
reduced uh on this patch and mid has also been reduced but not going to be important to mention in this specific
1:01:22
case but both of those did get nerfed now rich is going to have to space really well here on Jace if he ends up
1:01:27
getting caught by Morgan there's definitely an opportunity for Morgan to trade well with him so he's going to be staying in range mode for the majority
1:01:34
of this laning phase already doing a pretty good job of it now this is the matchup I'm most excited about because UK's returned to Korea right he's
1:01:41
playing his iconic Victor he's playing it closer he has the range Advantage here in this matchup and let's see how many advantages he can get early cuz I I
1:01:48
mentioned before despite being on a losing team in the LPL his Lane stats were pretty incredible and so far
1:01:53
putting that pressure on his Rich yeah doing some great trading here yep to the skies um but not really going to be
1:02:00
doing too much here I imagine that Morgan isn't too phased about how this one is going and having a peak in
1:02:06
towards top side of the map everything very very even so like he was saying yeah Rich trading well so far in the early game you'd expect that jce should
1:02:13
be able to have some Lane control I think that he probably wants to be able to get more than this right get zoning happening um make sure that Morgan is as
1:02:20
far on the back foot as he possibly can get it that's kind of the point of Jace when you normally pick Jace just want to Zone your opponent out play very
1:02:27
aggressively he went for grasp as well so he's trying to stack those up consistently and you see he's gotten a
1:02:32
ton of them already there's one more right there and is even gone for demolish here and will be able to get
1:02:37
that proc so really a lot of pressure for someone who's so known for laning across his career across multiple
1:02:45
titles bit of a positional uh scary moment here for ucal with hok so nearby
1:02:52
yeah well he's going to drive on through see whether he can get a flash oh man I think Uka didn't even think that he was going to go quite that far but that
1:02:59
gravity field just beautiful going to be able to hold huk in place UK loses a whole bunch of Health but not his flash
1:03:05
yeah that was critical he doesn't lose the flash but is going to give closer a ton of stability in the lane that was
1:03:12
otherwise starting to get really frustrating to play out do see the back completes for hype will grab grab a call
1:03:18
and head straight back to the Top Lane Paulo meanwhile just trying to get as much experience as he can completely
1:03:24
zoned out at the moment yep a little bit cheeky you could imagine but this wave state is uh pretty dire as closer is
1:03:30
going to get a decent chunk of damage on UK under the turret and is y so is always fine just rebinds the soul
1:03:36
everything's K Morgan continuing to get harassed as hype does turn back up here towards the top side to try and repair
1:03:42
what the heck's going on here and sponge in the area but hasn't actually gone for anything just yet and of course Feats of
1:03:49
Strength going to be what we're going to be talking about a fair bit today and first blood still going to be an option
1:03:55
here on this patch is now hok making his way down towards the bottom side as well rich in a little bit of trouble as Morgan trying to find some of these qes
1:04:01
doesn't quite get there though and hok at level four not going to be able to do too much throws a rock um that's more in
1:04:07
frustration than anything else looks like rich is going to go back home TP back down yeah it's really cool to see how much of an impact hbox already made
1:04:13
in this early game know bailing out uh two lanes that were struggling a little bit in terms of you know the melee
1:04:19
versus ranged aspect of their early levels and uh you know you think about hok as a player who like Los before him
1:04:26
who joined the LSK last year someone who gets a lot of kills early has a lot of action is super high impact for getting
1:04:32
his team leads but this case really just kind of patching some holes here making a big impact twice with some really nice
1:04:38
ease to come through good start here for bro um all
1:04:43
things considered with the draft and they're just going to look to build up this Misfortune and their front line so
1:04:49
any small disadvantage they have in the Top Lane you know is not going to matter necessarily all too much let's see what
1:04:55
sponge get done here is going to have to try and his way out of course fermacross stacked up but not actually opted into
1:05:01
here as po making his way down H deciding that he doesn't really want to get too aggressive as Polo also going to
1:05:07
uh act the same way he gets himself out of there as it looks like Grub's going to be on the table here for DRX they try
1:05:13
and grab those you can feel that first Blood Weighing on both of these teams not wanting to give this up and you know
1:05:20
closer doesn't have ult anymore because he used it to escape so this is a really tough fight here for bro no ult for pao
1:05:25
of course at level four either yeah CL are moving in Morgan there as well level six available he can go all out if he
1:05:30
would like it as it seems like bro should be able to get themselves one of these they've taken control of the area
1:05:37
at least for now so no feat of strength to go down for either team great double knock back here from Morgan is now
1:05:42
riched to the skies trying to throw closer around the gravity field is extraordinary and Polo is going to go
1:05:48
down for First Blood that's lazy field picking up first blad in his first game but it's traded back immediately the
1:05:55
Bros do not waste any time as Morgan is looking for rich as well grabs his opposite number and now lazy feel and
1:06:01
ukuk they have to just get out of there closer a bit distracted by minions as we can see as Morgan wanting to dash after
1:06:08
this little Cory but the valkyrie does come in and closer almost just straight up dies going to be out to get himself out Atlas you can already sort of start
1:06:14
to feel some of the problems of this composition here for DRX in terms of the tanky front line they index so heavily
1:06:21
into killing hok on the scarner and unsuccessfully uh in their trying end up
1:06:26
losing out more than they get with that first blood for lazy field so they walk away with that be of strength which you can see next to the game timer there to
1:06:33
the top Center of your screen if you want to track that but ultimately the fight goes the way of ERX here and you
1:06:39
can see look at these low health bars Spong is super low right and then you see the gravity well come through looks
1:06:44
really good here for DRX but lazy field uses his Valkyrie is now completely isolated he wants to kill hok here but
1:06:50
he's just too tanky he'll take sponge out on his way over and rich just can't get through this Cass
1:06:56
he will fall as well so a ton of gold going over to the Bros yeah that was uh
1:07:01
that was a bit of a gimme there as far as huk was concerned Rich really getting baited in as this is exactly what we
1:07:08
were talking about now Morgan is 2011 and we already said that if the game was even in more of like an even
1:07:15
game State this Cante would be quite happy moving into a mid and a late game well it's kind of now donez though uh
1:07:22
for for Mr Jace in a side lane even though he is ahead by a bit of farm these couple of kills going to make it
1:07:28
so that it's almost impossible to take him down there another crash into the wall here as sponge just told to leave the vicinity Dragon still leash as hyp
1:07:36
was over here positioning there from Pao as well Atlas just knowing that he could cut
1:07:41
anybody off here having banana brush control with that uh control super helpful there and just denying any entry
1:07:48
so you know sure you got the first of strength but Rich you can already see the problems here yeah LAN
1:07:56
very very quickly going to have that ultimate back up and available but rich not going to keep him interested for
1:08:01
that long and so now Morgan with that R button ready I think uh yeah if uh Rich
1:08:07
steps too far forward he is just dead especially with no flash dangerous times ahead here for the
1:08:13
new top laner for DRX and the returning legend that is Rich towards his top side great double up there from
1:08:19
hype yeah hype sitting on a Cole as well with a 270 gold lead right now uh once
1:08:24
that's finished that will compound upon itself as long as nothing goes wrong here so gets another double up yeah that
1:08:30
is massive actually down to 50% health is lazy F still going to be able to uh take that hot rod car uh SL um plane
1:08:38
underneath the turret always reminds me of like a hot rod like car thing but it is a plane of course um UK is going to
1:08:45
be just farming things up here as Rich moving over towards Morgan playing around some Vision I think Morgan knows
1:08:51
that he has a fair bit of strength here in this Lane still has to play it carefully given the melee into arranged matchup nature of things yeah you can
1:08:58
see the gold Leads Here across the board not looking great for DRX but specifically this Top Lane match up was
1:09:04
just so tough Rich trying to Greed for any auto he can get even used his acceleration gate just for positioning
1:09:10
there not going to go for an accelera shock blast yeah and I mean it's not
1:09:15
over right it's not doomed the Victor is going to scale really well damage wise corki will still have his two item spikes later but it's now for DRX a
1:09:22
really tough pick your battle type situ ation where you're already down a dragon
1:09:27
and you do not want to be giving any additional gold over here Misfortune to pick up any of those kills fortunately
1:09:33
for them so hype is not massively ahead but he's basically you know a kill up right now with all those assists and
1:09:38
that Co is going to be a big problem later on Dior really need to make sure they can find the right fights to take
1:09:43
here with their single Target CC look for punishing fights rather than just aggressive 4 V4 5 v5s yeah great vision
1:09:50
control here from Paulo spots out the fact that DRX was setting up for a little bit of something um and the 30 CS
1:09:56
gap for hype is actually the most gigantic and of course Misfortune fantastic laner just in general but now
1:10:01
bro looking to try and get another one as far as these objectives are concerned
1:10:06
if they get all three of these then that is going to be another Fe of strength or at least a third of it and that will put them at 2/3 only one more to be picked
1:10:13
up they will have that one on lock down and then it is just that first turret blood to be fought for for both of these
1:10:19
teams DX the fact that they managed to get at least that first blood was so big it feels to me like it's holding them in
1:10:25
this game um even if it isn't necessarily the be all end all we have seen it be so incredibly powerful you're
1:10:31
able to unlock those cool shoes especially when we consider the dragon spawning in 2 minutes that's going to be really difficult for them to fight for
1:10:37
because lazy field is just really not quite in this game he got the first Blood he was the hero there but you know
1:10:43
in doing so put himself In Harm's Way and they lost that big fight lost the followup fight and uh you know for
1:10:49
objectives here you you can see how frustrating it is for Rich to play out this Lane again youal in danger yeah
1:10:57
flashes forward going to be able to pick up oh the UL just goes completely wide the impale holds him out of the way but
1:11:03
still he's able to grab the kill onto UK cha storm not doing too much in Andel I'm sorry buddy wrong place wrong time
1:11:09
and you are just more food for the Y it looked comical but the results they're just fine hok making another big play
1:11:17
here it's time with his teammates set up together even though there was some anti Synergy there with theale he could have
1:11:23
just stopped you know um but still it was it was very funny and didn't actually matter I mean this is going to
1:11:29
lead to a ton of turret plate gold going over to closer as well as some additional damage for a potential first
1:11:35
turret to go over here they already have four grubs you can see how much of an impact that's making sponge kind of
1:11:40
greeting over here for these kugs will be denied as well so really just nothing coming up DRX way in this game the
1:11:48
Blackfire torch picked up for ukala as well at this point isn't really going to be a big spike as tombach in the brush
1:11:53
here andil coming over to try to Shadow so he can get back to Lane but he's not unfortunately going to be able to up absolutely amazing performance there
1:12:01
from Polo kind of saving what was a weird play um for the from the other two grabs that double stun on the shattering
1:12:07
strike and a gorgeous magnet storm and yeah they are they are out of options here as far as DRX is concerned so much
1:12:13
Vision there towards the top side and the Flash engage from hok as well just gives you such little time to react as
1:12:18
UK in this situation by the time he sees the the Scorpion it's too
1:12:23
late and I mean we're looking at a gold lead here as you can see in the gold difference over time that is starting to
1:12:30
really balloon quite quickly and like I said and like you mentioned that dragon
1:12:36
is up in 10 seconds here and if the DX do not deny it that is going to be those
1:12:41
uh that first beat going over yep and bro like we mentioned already only need one more of those and they are going to
1:12:47
be sorted dragon has spawned that's hextech Drake see what soul is going to be immediately afterwards but right now
1:12:54
h is trying to take control of the area Andel be able to sweep things out they get word the fact that that Leona is in
1:13:02
the area and closer has started this one up they are on Vision but I don't know whether this
1:13:07
dragon is going to last long enough for that Vision to mean anything at all UK moves over they get rid of that control
1:13:13
Ward but that is going to be a feet of strength going over to the Bros in the form of these objectives just the turrets to be worried about here as rich
1:13:20
is on the top side of the map definitely dangerous if he does get some spare time that is going to be the mountain Soul
1:13:27
coming up in 5 minutes time they can start fighting for first Mountain Drake Mountain soul with this Cante scar in
1:13:34
her front line deal with Rich who's going for a pretty unique build by the way uh a plated steel caps isn't that
1:13:40
weird but I was watching odam play this like tank Jace thing and it looked
1:13:45
really dumb I've seen it in Solo q a little bit and it's it's really difficult to kill the Jace often times
1:13:50
he went grasp as well you know and he's going to be quite tanky but it just doesn't help you kill Misfortune or the
1:13:58
tank front lines that you still have to deal with so it really puts a lot of the Otis on on ucal in this game who's 1.2
1:14:05
th000 behind and lazy fi who's still so far away from even completing his tier at this point here at 15 minutes sitting
1:14:11
at 138 Stacks has his Triforce at least but so much damage has to be put into
1:14:17
that Misfortune if they can take her out the front to back team fights definitely are possible here in the late game but
1:14:22
they're just so far behind it's hard to imagine a late game where they're not just completely bowled over yeah well
1:14:29
first Rift Herald is up and available don't have adakan just yet you can see he's going to be on the Northern side of
1:14:34
the rift and that is because that's where all the The Kills happen yes um
1:14:40
sometimes it's going to be hard to try and exactly work out um where adakan is going to be spawning um but this time it
1:14:46
was very easy huk looking for an opportunity here as andel's in trouble the ulti goes wide there from sponge and
1:14:51
he looks to try and get out of the way PO with magn storm doesn't get too much dump but that impale was brilliant at
1:14:56
holding them in place solar play going to be connecting and look at the health bar they are just way too big bro just
1:15:03
walk at them like a freight train and DRX can do nothing yeah there's just no damage DRX wanted to play around tops
1:15:08
side to deny that turret take because they wanted to to see if bro were going to come over here look for an aggressive play there and actually look to complete
1:15:14
their Feats of Strength but there's just not enough damage to get through those health bars it's a good followup engage
1:15:20
there from poo as well and now bro looking to clean this turret off the map look at how well they control mid lane
1:15:26
they also have Morgan sitting on the bottom side who had teleport available the entire time could have joined didn't need to and so that's the first turret
1:15:32
going over that speeds the strength here the first one of the LC Cup going over to bro yeah bro going to be the very
1:15:38
first ones to be able to buy cool shoes and I think that is absolutely fantastic they've been saving for it and that
1:15:44
suits them um because of the okay savings B so there you go yeah do we just miss a uh a a pedal as well on the
1:15:52
ground I think so shouldn't miss those that's that's not how things should be done we're going to have look at this again a calade of AR yeah it doesn't
1:15:59
really help that sponge misses his ultimate and maybe they could have at least turn this into a better situation
1:16:04
here but I don't think this is ever going to be a good situation for them with the you know the numbers disadvantage they have the tanky health
1:16:09
bars Etc uh you know we can say sponge missed that technically is true but I don't think it was really the main
1:16:15
reason why bro found success there H also missed um and I think there are a
1:16:21
few other misses there there some the main one is that huk didn't missed and managed to impale a couple of people and
1:16:27
there were just too many large bodies here on the side of bro to avoid being taken out so DX really going to have to
1:16:33
dig deep to try and find any opportunities here a minute and a half on the dragon and 2 and a half minutes
1:16:39
before arakan does turn up Morgan in position for that one and just going to be shoving this wave out make sure they
1:16:45
keep as much pressure onto DRX as possible is so frustrating as well here you know rich just walking over a
1:16:52
trinket he's like I want to come up here safely hopefully no one will annoy me on my way over right Morgan's already here
1:16:58
to get him and uh he can offer some damage back as you could see but it's
1:17:03
it's meager and the problem for this Jace is that he doesn't do a lot of
1:17:09
damage because of his build so even if he does hit a shock blast on the hype at long range because he has that one
1:17:14
perfect angle that I don't know if he's ever going to get but even if he does I just don't think hype really cares too
1:17:20
much about it oh de UK out taking a whole bunch of damage there are a couple of his friends around but they're not
1:17:25
really able to do too much here to the who just decides that he's going to be safe while he trades with you little bit
1:17:33
unfair and lazy feeling hyp back into the mid lane I feel like we're getting a little bit of Calm before a lot of storm
1:17:40
that's going to be coming in very soon unless Morgan decides to go all out which he does rich in so much trouble
1:17:46
here The Dashing continues The Flash does have to come out that means that rich will be safe for the moment Top Lane is out of the picture and now
1:17:52
another fight breaking out around this Dragon pit UK moving in watch out for that chaos storm but there's the magnet
1:17:58
storm speaking of Storms and the better one is on the side of the pros double kill for hype and Morgan he's there
1:18:04
towards the top side he's just taking out inner turrets and there is a Teleport coming in from Rich to try and
1:18:10
save the situation but it's looking real doomed it really is uh I I have to say I
1:18:15
mean I think the symptoms that you and I saw on the draft are really rearing their head here but it's a massive lead on top of it all and now that third
1:18:22
Dragon here is available but I mean that's not even really the story of the game we're watching the Herold take out mid turret get an additional crash here
1:18:28
massive void Lings here means it's going to be the inner to go over as well I mean this game is all but over here I
1:18:33
mean it's a 7,000 gold lead sub 20 minutes yeah and I mean you look at the Gold uh where it is across the board and
1:18:41
you're really like trying to go well which one is the least bad you're like oh it's the it's the Jace who is going
1:18:47
tank into two tanks um that have Mountain Soul point so it's it's really
1:18:53
I'm not optimistic Watch Fight one more perspec set the
1:18:59
magm intoe ultimate there and then the impale comes
1:19:04
in as well absolutely no way for hype to really take damage at all um so they were guaranteed to get that kill
1:19:10
gloriously orchestrated there by po you love to see it and you know you also
1:19:15
love to see wolf and I'm sorry to interrupt but I really want to bring up something that uh we saw recently and it was the changes between like win rates
1:19:22
after the Feats of Strength have come in there's been a lot of people worried about snowballing and things like this
1:19:27
um and we were also concerned about it we would spent like an entire POG State talking about the fact that first blood
1:19:33
is such a weird one that's the only one DRX didn't get and this is still a mega snowball has crashed down here from Polo
1:19:39
and the stats say as well that win rates haven't necessarily changed as far as a lot of things are concerned so it's it's
1:19:45
really weird how a lot of these stats do pan out but I think it's still a good thing to address regardless maybe we got
1:19:52
a little bit OV excited yeah I I wonder what the it is raous that's going to be the main flavor in L I was just trying
1:19:57
oton is Red by the way um that's just that's that's people tell me that there is a different one um that they see
1:20:03
sometimes in their games no no no we only have the red one here it's uh I I went for Two Plus cuz I I wanted to just
1:20:08
be a dissenting opinion I think well we'll have some crazy games here in the but this is definitely not one um yeah I
1:20:15
by the way I said two but like the one said three so that's why it says two plus and I'm right if it's three or four or whatever but uh I don't think that's
1:20:21
going to happen you're just trying to get more of the potential pull of possib but going back going back to that win
1:20:26
rate thing as all never mind let's let's talk about this all right hug is just trying to run forward and then get hit by a hammer that is sometimes AG G I
1:20:33
wanted to I wanted to say I wonder if we have any stats about like what the gold differences are at 15 was that one on
1:20:39
the cuz uh yeah the gold difference at 20 was about 7K here and you can see DRX
1:20:44
are really just I mean they are trying to get will they be out there are four
1:20:50
people on their way over and he is losing Health slowly but surely yeah this is going to be taken down so lazy field grabs his second okay as zakan
1:20:57
continuing to get a little bit frustrated here towards the top side of the map I don't know whether either of these players are going to be Sol it
1:21:03
anytime soon though so with huk off the map maybe some space here to be bought for DRX yeah it could be I mean it's
1:21:09
certainly going to be um a little reprieve some additional gold going over the lazy F he's really far behind on his
1:21:16
tier Stacks you know he got that uh you know manamune a long time ago but uh you
1:21:22
know he's he's still stacking so it's going to be fully the spike he's looking for it'll help to at least have the completed item but not as much as he's
1:21:29
hoping for there a long way away from that LeAndre for UK as well those are two spikes that could give DRX a
1:21:35
fighting chance of getting through that front line and because it's definitely not going to be rich who's doing it CU
1:21:40
his fimble vent now completed that's not normally what Jace builds a tier into but uh it is now I guess yep it is sort
1:21:47
of the flavor of the month as far as Jace is concerned the fact that like everything's just kind of like let's
1:21:52
build tank stuff just makes me a bit sad but I'm going to do my very best to ignore it and remember he's still got a
1:21:58
gun so he's still going to try and do damage sure um even if it's not necessarily going to do quite as much I
1:22:03
mean when we go back to the draft too I mean there were a lot of things they could have banned like they decided not
1:22:09
to ban the scarner which has been a huge problem from this game 7 out of 8 KP here it's hok so I want to give him
1:22:15
credit but scarner is also just so incredibly powerful can move around the map so quickly and has made such a big impact in these team fights and yeah
1:22:22
andle is dead guys um oh he's going to flash still probably dead but he's going
1:22:27
to try and do what he can before he does end up going down and when I say still dead he is not it's a double impale it's the other members of his team that are
1:22:34
going to be going down UK the first one to hit the deck as lazy field turns up and it looks like bro just going to back
1:22:40
away and say thanks for your mid laner well now Rich could be in trouble Morgan looking for an opportunity not wanting
1:22:45
to press the R button just yet yeah not quite and you know UK was closer than to
1:22:52
the LeAndre than I thought he has that done now and you can see the damage coming through from lazy field it's not
1:22:57
you know that there's no way to get through these tanks it's just not Jace that's going to do it bro need to be
1:23:02
careful about really just kind of overextending and and saying hey like this game is done we win this for sure
1:23:09
need to be a little bit more careful about how they take some of these fights I get it 7,000 gold up but uh some
1:23:14
caution should be taken they still win that fight they still get the kill on UK they still going to get Aon but if this
1:23:19
was more even game te might have been bit of a disaster yep and Aon is going to be Tak out here cool little buff now
1:23:26
around the Bros see what they can actually utilize with it there some Bounty gold going in here as Rich
1:23:32
finally manages to take that outer turret but this is the dire situation that they're in right 7,000 gold
1:23:38
difference bounties are up you've got a mountain Soul that's imminent here the Drake is in fact live and bro have some
1:23:46
extra lives to work with now yeah it means that they can heavily commit to a
1:23:52
dive going back to this situation here andil is the first Target eats a ton of damage actually handles that Zen flash
1:23:58
really well to buy himself some time here to get out and you can see UK is like okay I got to come over here and get some damage done nope you stepped
1:24:04
way too far across the line and you were going to get punished into all of this AOE he's the only one who gets taken out
1:24:12
but uh still a huge win here for bro it allows them to take oton which now gives them their withdraw as what I like to
1:24:18
call it cuz that's what it says over their heads in English um where if they die they give a little bit of gold they give a pedal but they just instantly you
1:24:24
can heavily all in on an objective like a baron for example exactly and so now
1:24:29
the Bros going to get it down to 50% health and I think that you know sponge is trying to make his way in Polo is going to hold him in position andle's in
1:24:35
trouble once again Eclipse doing so much work I just don't know whether it's doing quite enough as now close to going
1:24:42
back and yeah he's just going to pretty much recall and then head back in doesn't have teleport though so he's
1:24:47
going to be a little while making his way over a four versus five just for a bit as the magnet storm is gorgeous with
1:24:53
the bullet time over the top crash in from hok there as well finds an impale onto lazy field who cleanses Valkyries
1:25:00
does everything he can to get himself out of the way and this time finally handle is going to go down Morgan is just going completely ballistic here
1:25:06
towards the top side of the map flashes out of the gravity well another kill onto ucal the the Lord is definitely
1:25:14
Almighty in his first game of the lck cup they're going to take down sponge as well and it's only lazy field left
1:25:21
standing yes they stopped the baron but I don't know whether they're going to stop Dr it again last man on the lineup
1:25:26
today last one to fall and down he goes makes it an Ace
1:25:33
and uh look if you're uh cup half full uh-huh you know successful Baron deny
1:25:39
and also if you're full they can't play sconner again in the next game that's
1:25:44
right nor can they play the real Misfortune combo uh-huh they may not have banned it but they banned it you
1:25:50
know cuz this is fearless it's glorious um X just uh just wanting to get him in
1:25:56
the second one um but let's have a look at this fight one more time sacrifices himself early but honestly they their
1:26:02
wallets are heavy World their wallets are heavy and I don't think you play this fight out this way if it's even game State at all but they have the res
1:26:09
they have control over the baron pit to a certain extent and they're like yeah well I mean we could basically do Baron
1:26:15
and overextend and win a team fight all at the same time look at the damage coming through here even though rich is
1:26:20
very tanky and sponge is Sani it's enough damage here that they wear through it no one is threatening hype like sponge is like trying to play him
1:26:27
he's like oh maybe I can do something back no you can't and there's just not enough damage lazy feels so far behind
1:26:32
he's able to get a withdraw but that is it and Morgan is just he doesn't care if he dies or not because he's got that res
1:26:39
and he's gante lazy Feld lives for a really long time here but there going to be the baron taken regardless as you can
1:26:45
see now in live look at the glowing portrait looking really cool on this current UI for 2025 always making
1:26:52
updates the ltk and you love to see it um bro also making updates 2025 their
1:26:57
changes have been more winning if they manag to win this game then they have never lost for the entirety of an lck
1:27:04
cup ever 100% win rate I know isn't it extraordinary they're going to be able to grab themselves a mountain sold that
1:27:09
is 100% Soul rate as well 100% Barons in every game that they've taken since
1:27:14
elimination matches in KES cup they haven't lost exactly and they' have taken more aans in other than any other
1:27:21
team ever in l history exactly it is extraordinary that's extraordinary as
1:27:28
well the impale comes through the bullet time comes down and yeah we're being a bit fous we're having a bit of fun because ladies and gentlemen this game
1:27:34
is over closer diving on forward Polo once again showing off the fact that he
1:27:39
is going to get player of the match that is just how it's going to go his Rel has been so extraordinarily good and DRX
1:27:46
just going to be happy that he can't play it again in game number two sponge going to get wiped from the rift andle onto the fountain but uh Morgan's going
1:27:53
to do his very best to pulling back out there and we're not going to be able to talk about respawning Nexus turrets because unfortunately the Nexus does not
1:28:00
respawn and that will be going down imminently okay Savings Bank Brion with
1:28:05
the very first Victory here for our lck cup putting themselves 1er in the series
1:28:10
this is the kind of game for all those out there who are like oh man this new patch is pretty snowbally you might be
1:28:16
saying well I told you so but I don't think it was really about the the rift as much is it was about a really strong
1:28:24
early game and some big draft problems on the side of DRX especially lazy field falling behind you mentioned it 30 CS
1:28:30
behind I didn't even notice it right at the beginning how far behind he had really Fallen but he fell so far behind he was relatively irrelevant and then
1:28:37
they targeted UK so heavily it was hak who shut him down several times so he couldn't really Sid Lane they were like
1:28:43
okay one carry down second carry down no one kills the front line we can do whatever we want some of those fights
1:28:48
are bro little bit lacad a little bit halfhazard a little bit kind of H we win it doesn't matter a little bit sloppy
1:28:55
but when you're that far ahead it really just doesn't matter especially when you got the Bly boys in the Cante and the
1:29:01
scanner so I think we're pretty happy that we're not going to be seeing them again in the next game but this girl she knows exactly what's up because Paul was
1:29:08
absolutely extraordinary in that game and I think that hype joining this team
1:29:13
even though he is just on loan from KT him and Paul working together is really
1:29:19
demonstrating to everyone how good Polly was because we knew that hype very hyped up you know it's a bit on the nose but
1:29:24
that's just how it was he was so good in Challenger KT last year were amazing and uh yeah as you can see it doesn't really
1:29:31
disappoint 2.7k but of course he was the solo damage dealer pretty much outside of closer who didn't really find as many
1:29:38
of the fights as he wanted to for the bullet times the setups for the magnet storms just glorious it's so Li limited
1:29:43
data but still I mean he looks so much more comfortable than he did with Envy for sure it seems like it's a massive
1:29:48
upgrade yeah I would agree but now it is time for us to take a short break we'll hear from what the space has to say
1:29:53
about that game and then we'll be getting into game number two imminently see you soon

k fly those bro Flags proudly in the chat
1:36:57
if you subscribed already they are still undefeated in 20125 after the first game
1:37:03
of the season they go up 1-0 against DRX and one away from winning the series
1:37:09
welcome back to the space Deon alongside chronicler and ox and guys before we
1:37:14
jump into all the highlights we had that quick announcement that we were told right before the game history made here
1:37:20
in the lck yes lazy feel the first Vietnamese player to play in
1:37:27
the lck on an lck team a huge huge moment there for him uh and the fans
1:37:34
were huge about it across all of social media here are some of the comments from
1:37:39
the lck Vietnam page and what it means to them to have a player represented and we already have the casting represented
1:37:46
as well huge huge moment it's also an interesting one because you know bro has Morgan and Morgan actually has a ton of
1:37:51
fans uh in Vietnam cuz uh some touring he did there so it ended up being like you know you want to support your
1:37:57
Vietnamese player but also Morgan is normally who they look to support yeah one of my favorite content of last year
1:38:02
was showmaker who just took Lucid under his wing and they were just drinking Vietnam having a great time uh for the
1:38:09
same reason ton of fence there so that was really cool to see and lazy Field playing today is a is a really big deal
1:38:15
historically it is but that was about all the good feel that you got if you were a DRX fan because most if not all
1:38:22
of this game other than First Blood was bro let's take a look at some of the highlights here starting off with hbox
1:38:29
early pathing here to in uh to uh impact the game yeah and you know we talked a
1:38:34
lot about hanack we talked a lot about the scarner being hugely prioritized in LPL CK C and you can kind of see why
1:38:41
even though he doesn't get a killer even a flash here we saw a situation where he just gets a little bit of Lan pressure
1:38:47
allows the Y to Crash by taking a lot of Health paths down towards bot to pick up the kog so pretty efficient with his
1:38:53
time in and then looks to do a similar thing bot Lane and it's just that early impact of assisting your Lan is getting
1:38:58
that early pressure it's also just a really clean paing right because he's not wasting any time while this is
1:39:04
happening like only his uh Raptors are up top side is still respawning so he's not wasting any time he's setting up his
1:39:10
lanes for success and it's this level of aggression that hambach has always shown
1:39:15
and also if you go back to when bro was at his most successful it was when umpty had exactly games like this and could
1:39:21
take the rest of his team on his back the timing was so good cuz mid lane he helped the Y get the crash and then bot
1:39:27
Lane was when the wave was in a bad spot for the Jace where he wants to get the crash and kind of eliminate that happening and just little things like
1:39:33
this can make such a difference especially when you have this early game driven meta right and speaking of that early game driven meta that led to the
1:39:39
grub fight at 6 minutes which is still very early and all those plays made a huge impact and we talk talk a little
1:39:46
bit about the actual fight but it's more so when is the last time you remember seeing a 5v5 grub fight and a really big
1:39:52
thing here is that even though lafield does get first blood which uh he can put that one uh on his uh on his trophy
1:39:59
mantle what is really telling here is already this is what we hoped for this is what the idea fits of staring is is
1:40:05
that people are incentivized to actually fight because I can tell you after like last ofk every single grub spawn was
1:40:13
just answered by dragon and then maybe you contest a second round or you like you try to steal one away but actual
1:40:18
fights for an objective this early on I think is hopefully something that we're going to see more of because that's what
1:40:24
we want right we want action and after that it was a triple kill there for Bros
1:40:30
they basically took control of most of the game thanks to are we calling him head hunter huk are we going with uh
1:40:38
Hannibal huk all right we we'll keep working it find this to our last
1:40:44
highlight here 25 minutes in the team fight and you can see the combo between the bot Lane of the Bros and the
1:40:49
important thing to talk about here is vicious adakan has been taken so immediately bro start of the baron cuz
1:40:55
they want the fight and you kind of see here you know considering how far ahead they are the trading in this fight isn't
1:41:01
like excellent but they just don't care it's like they have the reset buff you know people go down they just teleport
1:41:06
back to base see the scarner just flying back and it's like okay well we got what we wanted the the payoff for the other
1:41:13
team is very small we're not giving over shutdowns we not even giving over much gold uh and really it just shows the
1:41:18
power of this buff once you secure it it's so telling as well cuz you can see that that bro does care about dying
1:41:24
normally in team fights there's a bit of an EB and flow as you like you use your cool Downs you back off so you don't go
1:41:29
down in there they just like nope we are sending it because even if they do end up getting uh taking a bit of an
1:41:35
unfavorable TR it doesn't matter because of the respawn the tempo lead that you're going to be able to get is always going to kind of offset and uh uh
1:41:43
unsurprisingly uh we are currently at zero angry out of con we're going to keep this running this is not the F the
1:41:50
last we're going to see of this uh because we have zero one or two or more
1:41:56
uh free camps running at the moment and uh far it's early it's early we'll see
1:42:02
it's early for us two two or more preds for those who aren't completely familiar it's how blood thirsty the game is and
1:42:08
it seems like it has to be pretty bloodthirsty to get the ruinous one uh and lck not the most bloodthirsty region
1:42:14
as well let's take a look at the draft here because again one of the changes with lck cup and the first third of the
1:42:19
season is full Fearless draft as now these 10 Champions will not be played
1:42:26
they won't be played including the bands as well yeah and some of them are some really high pry picks I think for me what stood out is the scarner cuz I
1:42:33
honestly ultimately think if the game went even or if DRX got the feat of strength you into your full ad team the
1:42:39
improved ninja Tabby with the physical damage Shield could have been huge but this scar it like there's a reason it's been PMA band in the LPL handback is
1:42:46
well piling it you could see that early impact he had and it felt like they kind of run away with the game so you know the problems are kind of solved by feish
1:42:52
you want have to deal with it again but I think ensuring handback is on a strong H jungle who can impact the game early
1:42:59
is going to be really important and with this the only tank jungler that has been meta and will still be open is maai
1:43:05
right who definitely has fallen pretty high on the prior list so we'll see if already gets banned and again as a
1:43:10
reminder because none of these Champs can get played we won't see Cante till at least the next series which I know
1:43:17
winning is is always a big deal and yeah I want to Echo what Ox was saying uh particularly with that Victor which I I
1:43:23
think we saw glimpses of could be a good moment but I don't know do you think thex is going to bring it back I don't
1:43:29
know hopefully it'll be more than just a feel good story for lazy feel and the
1:43:34
rest of DRX but Hero hok has a thing to say about it and we got a couple guys that have a couple things to say about
1:43:40
it let's send it on over to the casters to get into game number two heck yeah Deon thank you so much uh
1:43:48
guys for the breakdown and yeah I don't think like I think that adakan only has
1:43:53
has one form I think it's akan Khan the whole time that's uh that's all we're going to get that's how it's going to go
1:43:59
um that is you know I put my money where my mouth was there uh I I bet that it was going to be zero throughout the
1:44:05
entire season um went a little bit Ham on that one and so you're on the two plus Camp look I want to make it clear I
1:44:11
said two but no one said three right so they put me in two plus like I was it sounds like I was like yeah I think
1:44:17
it'll be like five but uh I thought maybe two would sneak in but after watching that game hard to say we might
1:44:23
have games that are more competitive where you know drags a little bit down into the mud in terms of Team fighting
1:44:28
constantly but it it doesn't look likely at this point that it's going to be a common thing valdis was the first one to
1:44:33
call it very early on during the uh opening event he was like mm I don't think we're ever going to see it and
1:44:40
that was of course echoed we didn't see it a single time in Challengers leading up until this moment as well so haven't
1:44:46
seen it in the LPL either um but that was only from what I watched they didn't watch all of it um but we just have to
1:44:53
see if you don't see the L it's like yeah I know that's what I'm thinking I'm like if you don't see the although the I
1:44:58
watched the what was it the fpx versus RNG series and it just there was it was a bit residence sleeper it was a little
1:45:05
bit on the bed side of things it was not uh the most uh exciting and hyped up LP
1:45:10
match that I've ever seen in my life I've seen a few of them and I imagine that they can do better so we'll have to see what is going to happen here and uh
1:45:16
we'll see what happens here in the lck cup as well whether maybe the Bros find a little bit more of a bloodthirsty
1:45:21
composition and awaken that ruinous Aon this time around I think we'll see
1:45:28
obviously we have Fearless drafts we'll see completely different comps and different Champions but I think we'll probably see a more competitive draft
1:45:33
this time around you have to hope so because DX's draft definitely left us very wanting uh and beyond that with
1:45:40
Fearless fan yeah we've got a lot of them we've got a whole lot of them across the world um but with Fearless
1:45:47
draft drafting gets even harder it gets even more challenging your Champion pools are tested even further so what
1:45:54
DRX has planned here what they have in mind moving on the blue side and something we've all got our eyes on here
1:46:01
try to bring this to a three- game series yep and try and get lazy f a win in his first series as well of course
1:46:07
the Bros currently undefeated in the lck cup we'll see whether they stay that way after this game number two or whether
1:46:12
it's going to go all the way as you can see towards the top left and top right no teams can play any of these 10
1:46:18
Champions that you can see at the top there so the bands not likely to change too much but we'll see exactly how it is
1:46:25
going to go as the AIA and nocturn going to be taken away first up well what happens often time in Fearless is picks
1:46:32
that are already high priority shoot up even higher like I don't think you can give Aurora away in this particular case
1:46:38
I think we'll likely see um The Ash taken away the kalista taken away as well maybe not necessarily on that final
1:46:45
blue side slot they might want to put lazy feel on the pick he's not known for it it's not one of his picks he's most
1:46:52
famous for anything like that but we'll see what ends up coming through V also very popular right now kind of the
1:46:58
second most popular next to scarner in this meta yep that was uh the second Champion that Faker played in the
1:47:04
opening uh the season opening as well uh scanner and then VI so taking away the vi option means that we do not get to uh
1:47:12
see backto back Faker jungle Champions which I think is very important for everyone to know Baris is once again
1:47:18
going to be banned away of course bans do not carry over so if a champion is banned you can see ically play it if it
1:47:23
is not then banned once again uh next time around so the picks will always change the bands may not necessarily as
1:47:30
the Aurora is going to be left up and snapped up easiest Aurora lock in of UK's life um I mean it's it's pretty
1:47:38
straight forward here there's no knock turn but still incredibly powerful pick
1:47:43
and they even used some of that uh time to discuss what they want to do next but I don't think there was ever a World
1:47:49
while that wasn't going to get locked in closer's response on the other hand will get a little bit more interesting obviously his yon is gone some of the
1:47:55
other blind uh picks you know that we saw a lot of the time like the oxan are gone Rumble available as well as ambessa
1:48:01
so we may see a trade of those picks here in the top side and hok will pick up his vgo he's very well known for wuk
1:48:10
scared I mean wukong's one of those other picks right now that's very popular here in Korea we're seeing it a ton we have I've seen it not find
1:48:17
necessarily a massive amount of success um from what I've seen but we have certainly seen a resurgence in The
1:48:22
Monkey King and looks like sponge is going to continue considering it will it be locked in that's the question lots of
1:48:28
circles lots of AOE CC exactly that's it's got such great Synergy with Aurora's ultimate because you're kind of
1:48:35
locked into that Circle and then he's going to start spinning around and it's a nightmare to play through that team
1:48:40
fight scenario if you can't Zone the Aurora out of the fight I'm curious to see what closer's response will be
1:48:46
because there's a lot of picks you can try to get advantages into Aurora with uh especially in terms of trying to set
1:48:52
up for team fights like LeBlanc was quite popular in the past players like showmaker utilize that very well must be
1:48:58
a blind kaisa here I mentioned one oh I do like this from closer of
1:49:05
course Vigo and tia together have been very strong but it was you and I wolf that were watching closer just destroy
1:49:12
people on TIA in the Gasper cup of course it's been a few patches since then but uh Tia has remained pretty
1:49:19
strong yes definitely true all right or going to to be taken away here I want to set up any more
1:49:26
combos in that Circle yeah it's a bit of a Thunderdome situation I think yeah and
1:49:31
having the stable Top Lane when your jungler isn't going to come online very early whereas a vgo is going to be very
1:49:37
relevant early I think is a a pick that rich might have gone for here see if they want to ban like gragas on top of
1:49:44
that as well um would be a lot of magic damage but I think a reasonable Choice very popular Top Lane pick at the moment
1:49:51
yep and you know w does a fair bit of physical depends on how you build the Kaiser but often times she is mostly
1:49:57
magic damage these days but I think the physical variety still does some stuff yeah it's mixed you know yeah yeah
1:50:02
especially when you don't have like true tanks and things like this um I think it's kind of okay to step away from more
1:50:08
of that uh full Pokey build as ambessa is going to be banned away here Morgan
1:50:14
going to be respecting that one not wanted to go up against it as this Rumble although Rumble has had a decent
1:50:19
match up into her they have you know some decent pick potential here cait would have been a great choice into the
1:50:25
kaisa I was wondering if maybe we would see something like a jinx uh in this particular case for bro the obsession
1:50:32
with picking Zia into kaisa just makes me so sad but thank oh okay so it's still going to be the ran theoretically
1:50:39
hype doesn't have to play Kaiser but I am so worried that we're just going to see um zyan on the bottom side for the
1:50:46
Bros it's fairly safe to Blind the Recon because Leona is not available TR was played last game so so maybe just
1:50:53
keeping his options open a little bit here as Gallo is being considered this could mean Top Lane
1:50:59
Aurora yeah the poppy as well could be going into the support position as we know of course does do very well into
1:51:06
the uh raan okay well it's looking like that is what we are going to see we have seen poppy in Challengers quite a few
1:51:12
times it's been played support every time uh it's not been played anywhere else so that will continue to be the
1:51:18
case here and on the side of bro what's that ad carry going to be here you know
1:51:24
tough match ups in kaisa there's a lot of them the Z knew going is the standard
1:51:30
response and my Pro I have a lot of problems with this but one of my main issues is that Zia is very low range and
1:51:38
we'll need to follow up on like a tiia knockback by getting very close to a lot
1:51:43
of Danger let's say between Gallo's taunt uh which is going to be fantastic inside of the Aurora Circle um the
1:51:50
Wukong ultimate you know etc etc so you're always going to be vulnerable and you only have one ultimate so while in
1:51:57
isolation strong into the kaisa putting yourself at a lot of risk here DRX I think this time around getting the
1:52:03
stronger draft here so much pre-built Synergy here and ritually playing the Gallo top yeah the Gallo top kind of fun
1:52:09
into the rumble very good at anti-magic damage and uh that is precisely what
1:52:14
rumble's ammo has been of course Rumble pretty strong so still going to be able to navigate the lane but I think that
1:52:20
rich should be able to nullify it if the game goes go the way he wants to I feel like this time the shoe is on the other foot as far as how the Top Lane matchup
1:52:27
is going to play out and we'll see whether some extra attention can be brought by this Vigo uh from hok
1:52:33
definitely a lot more aggressive on the top side of the map for bro this time and so I think we're going to have to see a little bit more of that uh bro
1:52:40
activity uh in the early stages of the game I do agree I have to point out to
1:52:46
the blow it up new slogan for bro it's just perfect can we blow it up can we say bro it up well that's the whole
1:52:52
thing in Korean and it's PL oh right yeah because it's the same oh God it's so good all right well we'll see whether
1:52:59
they can bro it up or whether DRX is going to be showing up in this game number two that was that was not great
1:53:05
let's get into
1:53:15
[Music]
1:53:20
it all right here we are ladies gentlemen I promise no more bad jokes like that and and I I no that was a lie
1:53:27
I'm I'm not going to be able to make that promise I've made promises before and i' they've burnt me and so I am not
1:53:32
going to do that anymore man this draft for DRX seems so good it does seem
1:53:38
strong especially when you just look in the mid lane and you're like oh they got Aurora she is pretty powerful yeah that was the first thing that kind of caught
1:53:45
my eye but then all of the other circles that came along with it with top tier Champion PCH kind of really solidified
1:53:51
it a little bit um every time I see the skin that rich is going for here it always makes me shed a
1:53:57
tear for the BBQ Olivers oh me too every time um but yeah I mean when you
1:54:02
consider also how good kaisa is into Rumble specifically like if you can isolate Rumble and catch him um you know
1:54:08
unawares if you end up in that 1 V one scenario you can often just take him out especially if you're accelerated yeah not to mention like having the uh Killer
1:54:15
Instinct to get out of equalizers if they're thrown down as well Rumble of course fantastic into Less Mobile uh 0
1:54:22
carries you can buy a whole lot of space but uh I don't think I uh I don't want
1:54:28
to underestimate closer on this to because I feel like he can really make early games very difficult for his
1:54:34
opposition and I think that these lanes are definitely playable for bro as this game begins so I think a lot of eyes is
1:54:40
going to be on the mid jungle for bro here if they do want to make this a two and DRX just trying to get to some of
1:54:46
these team fights and if it is like it was last time around with you know fighting over every single grub Camp
1:54:51
it's going every single grub spawn that's going to be coming up that could be helping them out here as the flash from lazy field immediately comes up as
1:54:58
poo getting aggressive hype is still at full health po does have to flash away though and so it is two Summoner spells
1:55:05
for two it was both of Po's though hype still holds on to his yeah that's important that Pao or rather that hype
1:55:12
is going to have his flash very important um in these early stages went for barrier as well for some potential
1:55:18
follow-up trades here kaisa can be quite strong with her plasma Stacks ear ear and was putting the pressure onto Paulo
1:55:24
there who now doesn't have his flash but he's a very mobile champion in the Recon so feels like a slight trade up here for
1:55:30
bro yep sponge now moving towards top side as well humu same can be said for
1:55:36
him see whether they do actually pay attention to this Lane as bro do begin
1:55:41
to push things out see decent little Advantage being built up here after the one
1:55:47
trade as po was able to eat his potions and also use that gleaming quill to get that health but back up to a manageable
1:55:53
State hpe not really needing to use anything just yet sitting on a biscuit and a potion and level three comes
1:56:00
through as well so yeah this is looking a little bit D up BL call not quite going to do too much there so andle not
1:56:06
going to be snared or anything but you can see this poppy in the early game not really able to hold a candle
1:56:12
to unfortunately not uh if you are a DRX fan lazy field
1:56:19
also getting zoned out of some Farm there was able to get the last few CS there but finding himself already at a deficit and now in danger of hok diving
1:56:26
early the turret ramp is going to be quite important in this situation yeah lazy field thinking about where he wants
1:56:31
to go and honestly there's not a lot of options because he has no flash that's First Blood going over to the vgo gets
1:56:37
the possession there as well to try and get a little bit more damage onto this turret beautifully done and that is going to be bro now picking up that
1:56:42
first feeder strength once again huk just making such an early impact in the game even earlier than he did in the
1:56:47
previous one and unfortunately when you leave a kaisa that has no flash out to dry in a situation like that if she gets
1:56:54
knocked up she's got cleansed but that's useless y against Paul's knock up there so just guaranteed death against an
1:57:01
early game vgo sponge obviously you know at level four isn't going to be making the same sort of impact if he were there
1:57:06
maybe he could have made an impact but unfortunately not to be the case you can see on the mini map where mid lane is
1:57:13
set he's trying to get that bottom Scuttle but lazy field is just left all alone here without Flash can avoid the
1:57:19
knockup it's an easy First Blood here for hok a feet of strength on top of that gold precisely nowhere to go um for
1:57:27
lazy feel in that situation I think it was navigated beautifully there by Polo huk and
1:57:33
hype and so so far I'm not as upset about uh you know Z being picked up I
1:57:39
think it's working out relatively well here of course we see Z and Kaiser has been the agreement all the time as hok
1:57:45
he's trying to do it again and man like it's so cool that just last year we had
1:57:50
the Lucid debut and we were like damn this guy running challenges guys he be he's going to be so good and then he was
1:57:56
and huk coming into the lck OR at least the lck cup after dominating Challenger
1:58:01
once more and also having a uh a great game so far of course very early days
1:58:07
but I love to overreact I mean he's such a he's such a similar player to Lucid anyways we're going to have a bit of a
1:58:12
scuffle here yeah this time towards bottom side Ender with the flash slam into the wall on Apollo they are going
1:58:19
to be able to take him down th health on this Dragon the seismic shove from closer is just a little bit of a wave
1:58:25
goodbye and that is going to mean that objective goes over to uh DRX nicely
1:58:32
done they're going to be able to grab their first stack there still needing two more to grab a fet of strength but that is really going to take the wind
1:58:37
out of the sails here a bro yeah that was a really well timed uh engage there coming through from uh andil and this is
1:58:45
really going to help turn things around here as we see hok is trying to rush this first gr but finds himself in
1:58:51
danger he's in a lot of trouble here as Rich looking to make his way over not quite in taunt range and it is still
1:58:57
just going to be that one grub picked up by DRX so I actually thought that huk might have got the Smite off there but I
1:59:02
uh missa it and that was in fact that grub going over to this Wukong so that
1:59:08
could be two very very fast objectives to be taken here by DRX to even out the
1:59:13
Feats of Strength just needing one more in four minutes time when that Drake spawns or in 4 minutes when the next
1:59:19
round of grub spawns DX do have that opportunity is humog 50% Health still
1:59:24
and sponge right place right time to deny this fgo any more of this Farm you can see already two and a half camps
1:59:31
ahead and the Wukong really coming into his own and of course we know Wukong is this Champion that really does like like
1:59:38
to hit level six and he's not even level six yet and he's having a great time got the farm lead this hug has spent so much
1:59:44
time ganking these Lanes trying to make an impact there um ended up losing a bunch of time topside ukel yeah seis
1:59:50
shove is looking real good GR entrance coming down there as well from po as closer trying to throw out some of these
1:59:56
rocks in goes and although the heroic charge picks up the Buckler and everything is going to be absolutely fine so just mid support having a little
2:00:03
bit of a battle and UK holds on to the flash Cool C and collected we'll go back to this play here on the dragon On's
2:00:10
flash play as sponge goes in Pao unfortunately just too close to the edge
2:00:15
here gets jumped on and pushed into the wall and then they end up losing control of the dragon and I mean look when you
2:00:21
look at the gold leads here you know for bro they're they're quite meager on the Zia and okay hold
2:00:28
up another Taun to come through there from Rich does have that Aftershock so we can uh find some pretty good trading
2:00:34
patents here up against Morgan you can see so far it's working out okay yeah although Morgan does have pretty reliable wave flar as andle trying to
2:00:40
clear out Vision does so successfully you mentioned the uh you know how nice
2:00:46
it is to play Gall into the rumble very tanky very difficult to burn him down
2:00:51
see that kind of on display there as well um but you know those gold leads I was mentioning are kind of fading away
2:00:56
outside of uks here in the mid lane and sponge does have level six now
2:01:04
finally here yeah possible opportunity here is Andel he doesn't so cannot lay
2:01:10
down that ultimate try and hold them in place for this Wukong you can sort of
2:01:15
see in your mind's eye can't you how these team fights are going to be orchestrated I think a lot of it has to do with you know andle making these big
2:01:21
plays or adding that large amount of Separation to these fights to isolate a couple of key targets and then use all
2:01:27
of that AOE to destroy them or you can just use the keeper verdict to lock down a single Target then you have sponge
2:01:34
layer in these knockups rich jump in from on top block him down and then UK
2:01:39
puts a circle around him to make it real difficult to escape so it's uh it's very very cool uh how this composition could
2:01:45
theoretically work out I think they're going to have to continue on the E that they're currently on because DRX there's
2:01:51
going to need for me there needs to be more um to be shown after what we saw in game one it was not exactly the greatest
2:01:58
and bro right now just uh chilling out Dix losing some Farm here in the bottom Lane only a little bit but we'll lose
2:02:04
significantly more on the top side actually uh with this setup here kind of awkward for them lazy feel so late to
2:02:11
turn up to this Lane already 25 CS behind finds himself 200 gold behind as well was ahead earlier because of the
2:02:17
kill but oh the cannon that's that's that's something I mean that's so you can see that gold lead kind of wash away
2:02:23
a little bit um there that hype did in fact have still has but a bigger one
2:02:28
rich is going to be able to turn this into though a plate Morgan did not want to expend his teleport to come down here
2:02:34
and try to deny it so it's a still relatively close game here yeah and it's really going to be about these next few
2:02:40
team fights 45 seconds until the dragon but before that a second set of grubs I mean DRX already have three to get
2:02:46
further uh up to to 4 five would be huge for them and also potentially if they can get all three that Fe of strength
2:02:53
completed oh hyp gone very aggressive here lit on fire immediately and down to 50% Health means that this grub fight
2:03:00
could be very difficult and a possible feat of strength opportunity here for DRX if they were able to lock it down
2:03:05
all three of them the ability for huk just to steal away one is certainly going to be there five grubs though
2:03:11
going to lead to a possible first to but here's another engage great double knock up there from andle as huk tries to get
2:03:17
himself out but doesn't manage to Hype utilizing that blade caller real nicely but not quite nicely enough as in goes
2:03:24
closer his patented overly aggressive play coming on through there as he tries to flash away but he just takes a stick
2:03:31
to the head and that is going to be sponge locking down that kill and now Rich looking for some more damage to
2:03:37
this turret going to be able to grab another demolished proc grabbing some more plates and this could be another
2:03:43
speed of strength going over to DRX as the grubs going to get started it looks like it will be to even it up no one
2:03:48
here to deny hok on the other side of the map maybe trying to turn this into a dragon play but full control goes to UK
2:03:55
there in the Sid Lane so I'm not so sure he's going to be able to make that happen his situation is quite bizarre remember hype is very low on health is
2:04:02
actually starting to deal with the wave he's far away so isn't going to offer too much damage but it's really hok who gets punished you know we often jokingly
2:04:07
call him paper man here on the global side of things because he's just not that tanky on the Vigo and another great
2:04:13
engage from UK or sorry from andil and closer this is a very bizarre decision I mean hype's incredibly low there's it
2:04:20
was kind of a zero sump game there and he just gets completely punished for it so game turns on its head very fast I
2:04:26
mean a complete 360 here or 180 rather I should say yeah and um wait so DX took
2:04:33
five grubs is there one still there there is so somehow they got them to get away from the last grub so that fet of
2:04:39
strength hasn't actually come on through just yet the dragon was taken by bro man I'm confused I need to fill in those
2:04:44
blanks somehow yeah cuz hok was on the bottom side of the map but UK had a lot of control over the bottom waves I
2:04:51
thought he wasn't going to necessarily be able to take it then they also didn't get the and there's like question mark ping I think the question mark ping is
2:04:57
telling me more about what could have happened than anything else um as you now moving back up there towards this uh
2:05:04
grub Camp I'm trying to think if there's like a reason why you would want to I feel like alive H probably should just
2:05:11
go over there immediately but maybe they just don't have enough information as to what's going on and sponge should be able to get over there and lock that one
2:05:17
down as there we go going to wanted to just like rush over and try to contest
2:05:22
dragon as fast as possible I don't know really what ended up going down there and we'll probably never know without watching the VOD um maybe you guys know
2:05:30
and you guys watching a little more closely but if DRX win they can let us know in the interview with whoever gets
2:05:35
player of the match um maybe that's what it's going to be that's right we're no longer P we're P I didn't really want to
2:05:42
talk about it cuz it does kind of make me a little bit sad because p is just it's so POG um but now we're a bit oh my
2:05:49
God think of the emote possibly Palm champ Palm champ is pretty great wait do
2:05:56
we just get like pool potty skins so it's like palm and pal like pom pom pom like this is by the way potentially
2:06:02
first turret if there's not a a better answer here hok is very late yeah closer should have the wave clear to be able to
2:06:07
take this one down but man that is well and truly set up remember this is six scrubs as well yeah I mean I think it's just I think it's just dzo yeah should
2:06:14
be I mean they have to bring so many people up here to stop this UK can clear this so
2:06:19
quickly and I mean there's just no no realistic way to stop this unfortunately for bro Sox really bringing this game
2:06:26
back after what was a rocky early game cler will be able to at least clear out this wave Morgan putting on some
2:06:33
aggression here in this bottom Lane as well uh head by 22 CS right now even though there is four minions to be
2:06:39
picked up here by Rich and so control of the bottom Lane is there for bro but outside of that a
2:06:44
little bit of a worry arakan going to be spawning here towards the top side no surprise yeah viciously yes he's going
2:06:52
to voraciously spawn on the top side of the map uh UK playing very respectfully
2:06:58
here I don't think we'll see any craziness out of hok in this case but they feel compelled to group up here on
2:07:04
the top side because if UK's just given a little bit of alone time that is dead turret and pizza strength completed so
2:07:12
that's just a big win on the bottom side of the map for DRX elsewise as you can see Sponge here has full control can
2:07:17
take the Scuttle and bro don't actually set anything up here a lot of loss CS really well played mid game here for
2:07:24
DX thus far yeah it's working out very well just need to find a way to grab that first turret and they are looking
2:07:31
real good as far as being able to find some uh nice new shoes and things like that Feats of Strength the team that's
2:07:37
managed to get you know the most of them uh has won the series uh has won the game thus far samp size is one um but
2:07:46
the win rate is still 100% um no matter how you slice it take that Bron yeah
2:07:51
exactly take that mathematics all right Morgan uh going to get taunted otherwise
2:07:57
he's not uh too worried but you can see rich is just doing that Gallo thing where you just don't take a lot of M D
2:08:02
yeah he's like yeah I'm just getting a little warm here um but I'm pretty okay with it cuz it's winter it's cold outside yeah he likes the sauna strategy
2:08:10
you it uh helps him with his morning routine we did see conqueror picked up for Morgan uh so it's no surprise that
2:08:16
he did go for the rift maker looking for a bit of a brawly dueling Style here on
2:08:22
this Rumble which is going to suit the match up into Gallo as well as uh him being a big threat later on in these
2:08:27
team fights where you're going to be at Close Quarters because of the Aurora ultimate so I do like this choice but
2:08:33
down goes the turret yep that is just going to be first turret blood going on over to DRX and so that is two ft of
2:08:38
strength and some cool shoes up and available here for the squad once they do have those two legendary items
2:08:45
secured and we're getting closer and closer to that of course youal does have one of them done that luden's picked up
2:08:53
all right huk trying to clear out some Vision Rift Herald going to be taken here by Sponge man bro need to find
2:08:59
something and it's so weird right because we have often said that bro's
2:09:04
ability to just try and make plays to get themselves back into a game is what they've been missing no matter what
2:09:10
players have been on this team it's always been a big factor for this squad and I think closer is the one if there
2:09:18
is ever a player to just do something r that might work like it's him it did not
2:09:25
work last time but he went for ITF he went for it no I mean that that's so true though that that is the type of player that closer is and that's why he
2:09:32
suits hok's play style so incredibly well and why we watch Kook up and got a lot optimism super optimism I should say
2:09:39
but in this game he's kind of been bullied by UK a lot of the time cuz you you mentioned like Bros so known for the early gam so known for their objective
2:09:46
control even early on even without this roster um but you know what known for winning Aurora and she's kind of winning
2:09:52
pretty hard she has right now currently the biggest individual gold lead on the map you mentioned the first to pick up
2:09:58
that luden's companion and the game State here is really tough for bro to fight out unless DRX make an error so
2:10:05
they're kind of just giving these objectives up Herald is going to crash here into this mid turret be the second turret likely taken of the game cuz they
2:10:11
have six grubs I mean this boiling is going to pop out and I mean there's just nothing you could do to stop this so they just keep collecting gold and
2:10:18
getting more map control here you can see Rich has just been given so much leeway in this side lane where the
2:10:23
rumble really can't break through his shield and he's just like cool I'm chilling winning everywhere and he's
2:10:30
even had the goal to build like steel caps yeah he's like I don't care about you Rumble yeah exactly I just want to
2:10:35
make sure that I am going to be able to get things done in these team fights of course steel caps if you do get the upgrade as well are completely
2:10:41
ridiculous um and so yeah it's looking pretty nice second dragon to be picked
2:10:46
up here by DRX by the looks of things Uka going to come on over and add some support uh follow should be able to
2:10:52
clear out this Ward and moving on over and yeah it's a grand exit you can understand exactly why as Morgan might
2:10:57
be able to get something done here going to be taking some blood pedals as well certainly going to feel good minute and a half until arakan does turn up and
2:11:06
yeah I don't think we've had quite the amount of aggression that we need um in order to get a ruinous arakan so it is
2:11:13
once again the aanan and uh yeah yeah I mean
2:11:18
unfortunately for Morgan he wasn't even to even to get that turret there on the top side lazy fi lazy field coming up he
2:11:24
could Al in yeah turet there's a lot of Al in uh availability of course rich not
2:11:30
going to be a to ult in on top of himself as Morgan was even able to get a blood pedal that was pretty cool Justice punch avoided and the void Seeker not
2:11:36
going to seek anything or not going to find anything at least as The Equalizer getting a lot of value but Morgan's still dead sponge going to be able to
2:11:42
grab that one huk looking for an opportunity here but I don't know whether he's going to be able to find it decent little St but it's under rich and
2:11:47
he's so tanky another Wall comes down but closer is just going TR to put it away immediately Rich taking out the
2:11:53
sacrificial Gallo but in return it looks like we're going to see UK take that bottom side turret so sacrificed himself
2:12:00
you take the rumble off the map and UK's going to get more gold on this Aurora and I feel like this is still just a
2:12:06
huge trade up for DRX it's a small consolation prize you could say for bro
2:12:11
but I am very concerned about what the rest of this mid game is going to look like as we Prest 20 minutes here and Aon
2:12:17
spawns things are looking Grim maybe trying to find a little bit more here Kong's ult is down so sponge isn't going
2:12:22
to be able to do much they do actually have hype here as well so some respect needs to be shown they might be able to trade this turret for turret against
2:12:29
small victories and we haven't really seen the big Wombo team fight right we haven't
2:12:35
seen like the utilization of all of the circles and the resets be attempted here
2:12:41
by bro I think there is an opportunity like there's a world where Bros composition does work right like they
2:12:47
have a lot of explosive damage available and if you do line up and equalize it correctly and then H can get those
2:12:54
resets as yes adakan is only red ladies and gentlemen the ver vicious version is
2:13:00
once again gracing the rift how noxian of him it is quite nox which is uh
2:13:06
certainly on theme absolutely true well with this shiv too in the mid lane lazy
2:13:11
field was just constantly able to affect waves and then go pressure side Lanes like he did with that last play top side
2:13:18
just all coming up DRX right now and that third game that we were hoping for seems more likely by the moment it's not
2:13:23
over by any means but like you said closer really is the one who has the most agency to make a big play happen
2:13:29
because he has that semi Global ultimate has the ability to set up a single Target pick he's going to need to you
2:13:34
know get over here soon they have vision of this stopping it's another story they know exactly what's going on and it can
2:13:41
be very dangerous cuz the amount of shred that you do get huk moving on over and the teleport's coming in all right they are committing to this andil taking
2:13:48
a fair bit of damage as now Morgan has turned up the equalizer going to be so dangerous team fight comes down Killer Instinct into the backline it's a
2:13:55
phenomenal heroic entrance and lazy field is popping off he gets into that backline that's a triple kill for the
2:14:02
Vietnamese player and bro they are sent packing that is Aon going down as well
2:14:08
so Richie can feel free to try and die because it doesn't even cost them too much at all and that's that combo that
2:14:14
you were talking about in the team fight all the circles coming in Rich dropping that shield on top of an already
2:14:21
incredibly tanky poppy there in andil who's positioned to try to deny any
2:14:26
entry here I mean look he blocks cl's ability really set up a Weaver's wall here goes to the wall look at this equalizer it's decent here but once the
2:14:34
ultimate goes down I mean you're you're stuck on top of an Ting rich and Ting sponge here lazy peel as you said popped
2:14:41
off in this fight and starts cleaning up house on the other side of it nice counter to kaisa he says as he takes out
2:14:47
his opposite number in hype four kills now on the kaisa extremely accelerated I
2:14:53
mean we're even on blood pedal Stacks but put that graphic away I don't know if it really tells the story of this game right now I don't think so um what
2:14:59
tells the story is a little bit the gold on the top of the screen there 4 and 1/2k going to be the lead for DRX the
2:15:06
fact that they've got a couple of these dragons as well full control of the Dragon pit at the same time I mean they
2:15:12
have the reses now too so they can just dive and with no consequence minute 20
2:15:18
as that is ticking down and so yeah you can see sponge very happily basically in the enemy base uh because you just can
2:15:26
how it goes two items have been picked up here by the Wukong as well and it's a very dive you know focused comp when
2:15:32
from ahead like equalizer just to clear the wave here is just showing the desperation the ult is back up for UK
2:15:39
spong's ult's back up rich will have his in just a moment so you have to play so respectfully as bro but that means your
2:15:45
turrets just get taken off the map tick scrubs let's see whether they
2:15:50
can find an here as hok's like well how am I supposed to reset they can't die I mean vgo is not really known for his
2:15:56
flank engages necessarily from behind a situations like this yeah not very tanky
2:16:02
oh there's 30 seconds and then bro I think just need to pull the trigger I think you're right but you win
2:16:09
a fight you'll get some pedals and some gold it'll put you back in it but it's just a limited win if you can get it that is to
2:16:15
say well rich now just moving on over Justice punch is odd he's just right underneath that turret trying to get
2:16:21
some use out of this uton passive the ulti does come down there from mukal and DRX just going to wipe the floor with
2:16:27
that turret they take that one down real comfortably and yeah Rich invests his entire health bar but he would have
2:16:32
probably even preferred to die go back to base and buy and stuff like that yeah he's a I have TP now I have to waste all
2:16:38
of this time pressing B and stuff oh man he's like guys the withdraw animation is
2:16:43
faster than the Reco can I just die and that's when uh that's when the team is
2:16:49
telling him absolutely not but uh what's interesting too about this lineup here for DRX we'll talk a lot about this
2:16:55
when we go through the rest of uh LSK Cup and the regular season of lck but this roster for DRX doesn't have
2:17:02
necessarily like a strong shot calling voice I mean Rich has a ton of experience right I think he's going to
2:17:07
have to pick up a lot of that um ucal in the past has been fairly vocal but then you have sponge who's still relatively
2:17:14
new player lazy feel is playing his debut game right now and Ando who probably is the quietest player in the lck is known to why but I think that
2:17:22
Andel like has been this guy that's known a lot right I I think that I don't necessarily think he has the
2:17:27
assertiveness as far as his character but I think that he could work I know that CV Max was working with him like
2:17:33
very much on uh quondong freaks previously trying to make him into that guy so maybe he found some success yeah
2:17:41
well my point is I mean despite that despite my kind of like I don't think this this roster will necessarily have good shot calling early they're looking
2:17:47
pretty clean with their macro decisions you know like that's good to see that's a really positive sign this early on in
2:17:53
the year literally in our debut game here you missed a cannon so I think it
2:17:59
might be doomed I think it'll be okay the Bro comeback starts
2:18:04
here well it's going to have to actually if they are going to make a comeback do you bro Le in Magic Atlas well it ain't
2:18:09
bro while I'm breathing wolf as is what I hear and currently um the the way I'm
2:18:16
talking is with air and so I must be breathing okay in goes Rich doesn't find the taunt he can fish for those as much as he
2:18:22
would like and never really be punished for it 6K going to be the advantage and the baron I think going to be that last
2:18:30
nail in the coffin yeah there's some gold sitting on the sneaky with our ward in the back not by the control not
2:18:36
spotted just on the edge there uh they also had vision of the controller as you can see by that Ward ping so it's
2:18:42
actually kind of uh strategically placed there I think not the coincidence but
2:18:49
have the back by and return void staff done for UK this is a big Aurora and
2:18:54
they are happy to start this it's on Vision but sometimes seeing isn't everything Atlas as they say very true
2:19:01
kuk is going to lay down some Mist let's see whether he can find a way in here to try and get something stolen away seis M
2:19:06
shove going wide hug in position like this could be a difficult Baron as
2:19:12
sponge decides to turn it he is able to lock that one down humock gets in there but doesn't get away with it and that is
2:19:18
Rich locking down that kill they do manage to take down the Wukong but the knockups are just gigantic they take
2:19:24
down Andel but hype is still in so much trouble lazy feel wants to flash in and he will do so takes down his opposite
2:19:31
number and he's going to be able to help Tidy Up Morgan there as well the Lord could not save them and bro I think
2:19:37
you're going to have to play a third game in this series looking likely man unel is having a fantastic night Atlas
2:19:43
he is really feeling himself in this second game in particular but even in game one had some decent moments and uh
2:19:50
that is that paper's not going to be able to steal the baron and he just Falls instantly The Flash followup knock
2:19:56
up though from andil was just chef's kiss and now the base is falling here
2:20:01
again at 27 minutes yeah I don't know whether Polo is going to be able to save this one as yeah lazy Feld with these
2:20:07
three items completed is doing so much damage void Seeker almost killing Hut on
2:20:13
the fountain where he stands but the Nexus will go down and that is a tied up series lazy field picking up the very
2:20:20
first victory for an import on an lck team here in the lck cup we are breaking
2:20:26
records and making Milestones all over the place here today yeah he wanted to spread the the record breaking across
2:20:33
two games he was like I could have won game one but then I wouldn't spread the love so game one first time he's ever
2:20:40
played you know non in the lck game two first win yeah and then he can win his
2:20:45
first series or even lose his first series it's fine it's going to be a first no matter what true as we go into
2:20:51
game three I think there's a few takeaways there for bro as well um there's something cathartic about Zia
2:20:56
losing cuz I feel like that champion has frustrated us for about 3 years now and she always loses I mean she just does
2:21:02
yeah she had like a I don't know I pulled the stat last season she was like 30% win rate or something maybe it was
2:21:07
even lower than that uh it was crazy anyway atas we got to go back to the draft again both of these losses I feel
2:21:14
like are somewhat heavily tied to the draft there were definitely some windows for bro but they didn't ban Aurora yeah
2:21:19
in game two we're so many other Champions are disabled because of fearless and UK tops the damage here was
2:21:25
he the main character would have you even gotten P if we had did P probably not but the fact that he can warp these team fights and they have such a strong
2:21:31
robust draft here that works so well together all five Champions have Synergy together in this draft I mean it is just
2:21:38
night and day what that these two teams had to work with absolutely I think the answers were beautiful by DRX in their
2:21:43
draft I think the Top Lane Gallo certainly a a phenomenal adaptation here from rich to really close the door on
2:21:50
the Rumble um so certainly some things to be taken away but what I love about it is we get a three- game series in the
2:21:56
very first one of the lck cup time for us to go to a short break when we get back space is going to break it down and then we'll have game number three see
2:22:01
you soon

2:29:15
DRX pick up their first win of the Season makes it one to one who will take
2:29:20
the first series of the 2025 season we'll find out in just a little bit welcome back to the space Deon alongside
2:29:26
chronicler and ox and you know the the 2025 Bros the Kasa Cup champions all the
2:29:33
good feels that that didn't that didn't last as long as we thought it would hype is uh not there cuz he was playing Zia
2:29:40
and and and really I think that kind of solidifies that uh even though kaspa cup was a very impressive achievement in it
2:29:47
of itself it doesn't always really tell the full tale of what's going to happen and I think we saw in this game that if
2:29:53
they don't get the start they're looking for uh bro unfortunate and arguably they kind of got the star that they were
2:29:59
looking for and it still wasn't enough a yeah so we see in this early trade lazy feeli ends up burning flash uh the Ron W
2:30:07
raon trades Flash in return but this ends up paying off pretty big for bro because they're the first to capitalize
2:30:12
on it and andle makes a bit of a mistake here just steps up unnecessarily gets chunk down pretty heavily takes a little
2:30:19
bit more damage from raan as well and at this point it's like well I can't really stick around I'm going to recoil but I
2:30:26
feel like there should have been some uniform decision between them either they both stay or they both go but leaving your ad carry like this is just
2:30:33
kind of leaving them to the walls this in theory looks good right you're able to immediately have uh take
2:30:39
lazy th out get a lead on your snowballing jungler but and this is
2:30:44
where we're not going to talk about the draft in too much that but I do think that one of the big things that we've seen in Solo que as well is that team
2:30:51
fighting is everything right now we have so many fights way more than it feels like we used to have so having a
2:30:56
composition that can actually team fight really well and then you look at the draft from DRX and that was Circle
2:31:02
Galore right between the Aurora El between Wukong between Gallo between
2:31:08
poppy trying to move in a fight and playing in the 5v5 is extremely hard yeah so after that set pack though then
2:31:14
we've got highlight number two here 540 at the Drake and uh you're like uhoh
2:31:19
maybe maybe bro doesn't got this yeah so great move there from Andel to stun the raan poing a raan really good for this
2:31:25
reason and this kind of starts off the return cuz they managed to secure the dragon here and despite losing First
2:31:32
Blood making some Headway towards those feat of strength and then we get this fight up towards the top side once again
2:31:37
andle leading the charge in his puppy andle actually having a an exceptional game and the big thing here is that with
2:31:44
any vgo comp you want someone to play off of but the only other person that provides reliable SU is raan who's
2:31:50
playing into poppy so it feels like every single fight they're unable to
2:31:55
really find a Target there's also a lot of slippery Targets on the opposite end so you're not really finding anything
2:32:01
and then on the re-engage obviously kind of runs you over was doing there uh yeah
2:32:06
actually while that was happening uh I was saying man I've done that play as tiia and it just it's
2:32:13
horrible fortunately closer oh no he's he's also dead yeah I I I had faith for
2:32:19
just about second there yeah I I think closer forgot it's it's it's hero hok
2:32:24
and and Commander closer he tried to beat hero closer that one didn't quite work out final highlight here oton fight
2:32:30
at 21 minutes and again the Bros get into the objective a little late looks okay but the immediate turn in the
2:32:37
circles yeah I mean the engage here on the Z is beautiful ult shoes but this is one of the issues with Z is like your
2:32:43
ult can dodge one bit of CC you then have to flash out of the Aurora Al which is timed well you just get ran down by
2:32:50
the Kaiser and the game is just done from here Yuko actually having a really good over game very clean always where
2:32:56
he needs to be and I do think that this was the right call because we checked Wukong had like and this is Wukong right
2:33:02
with his passive had like 60 armor zero Mr so in case you do catch them off guard I think oton can be a turning
2:33:08
point but the positioning that was really awkward freem men were trying to then engage on a poppy cuz huk so
2:33:14
desperately wanted the reset and ended up being a bit of a disaster just the late engage works so well and I feel
2:33:19
like they the ones starting the fight and as well as you said like looking at the poppy as the first Target you can
2:33:24
understand the thought process to get the resets but it's just never going to pan out yeah now tied one to one DRX
2:33:30

it just comes in it's like can I get a sub please absolutely you can shout out Salazar for he's a he is a true bro
2:34:12
that's what we know from this they didn't even win they lost the match still waiting to gift five Subs that's a
2:34:18
player for you bro a no Str changes to losing right there's still gigachad if you at home want to go ahead and give
2:34:24
some subs you're able to do so right now in the chat and fly all the flags and unfortunately this one here there are no
2:34:30
Flags flown so far for ruinous uh Aon because there's been and we've had
2:34:36
fights for Dragons we've had fights for for grub so it's not like nothing is happening like there are actually a lot
2:34:41
of back and forths but unfortunately still not enough to wake up Aon and I
2:34:46
think the Aurora is 100% the number one pick they look at with this draft and go
2:34:51
okay that's definitely going to be a big one to be missing in the next game yeah I think for me my takeway is kind of you
2:34:58
know game one handback was on this corner huge amount of impact really strong pick not a fan of having him on
2:35:03
the vgo I think he does a great job of leading the charge give him a pick to lead the charge rather than a pick
2:35:08
that's like okay well if my team set up I can get resets the thing is the comp didn't have that much reset as well so
2:35:15
you know sometimes fa like oh we don't get the pick anymore I think uh Broan should be happy that get the vgo anymore
2:35:20
yeah the vgo didn't really work closer off I know his tiia is one of his better Mage but like off of melee pick always
2:35:26
feels rough and then hype I do think that one of the things with with Fearless is that your pool gets pinched
2:35:32
more and more but as o was saying earlier there's kind of a critical massive dive you can reach where Zia
2:35:37
just doesn't do the trick anymore and if it's just kaisa maybe it can give the benefit of that but that was like
2:35:43
basically every single champion on the enemy team was going to be able to die like even just Wukong being near you for
2:35:49
shoot to all yeah I also think that like certain CH like if you're playing Z into VI you can avoid the AL really easily
2:35:55
like that's effective into aora like you Al up and then you come down and you're still in the AL and then you have to
2:36:01
flash out the Al and then the Kaiser just runs you down like certain Champions your all really does deal with
2:36:06
well I think another example I remember wolf mentioned last year was like the cannon where you jump up and then you come down the Y still running you just
2:36:13
get stunned anyway yeah that we spoke a lot about Bros and the Champs that they played on the opposite side we finally got to see lazy field get comfortable in
2:36:19
match even though the Ling part didn't go so well got a triple kill earlier closed it off with a double double with
2:36:25
ucal on the Aurora so let's see what they have in store here DRX and bro
2:36:32
these two squads battling for their groups to get themselves win this is a game that both of them looking across
2:36:38
the border thinking we got to get this one for team who will be able to do it let's find out together as we send it on
2:36:44
over to Atlas and wolf thank you so much ton thanks for the breakdown guys and yes I'm hoping
2:36:50
that we don't see any more paper man and the uh The Feathered lady because feathered lady just here in the LK does
2:36:56
not get very many WS you won't see it anymore in this series I can tell you that I can guarantee it yep thanks Wolf
2:37:02
I appreciate that you're the one that actually guaranteed that they weren't going to be played again um it's nothing
2:37:08
to do with the Fess draft don't you worry about that one and so now we've got like the full 10 Champions that are
2:37:14
officially banned away plus another 10 bands to be layered on top after the bands all do come through in this game
2:37:20
so some some PS are going to get pinched let's just say that uh you mean you know going into this one 20 + 10 right is
2:37:28
that what I said did I not say that I I see yeah okay so I it's just wrong I'm just telling you there's even more B
2:37:34
it's going to be even more Banny um this is how it goes so some of the pcks that
2:37:39
have been banned every game are still protected and so now you can kind of toy with uh leaving some of those open and
2:37:45
trying to grab them on uh first pick here as bro so picks like the AER the kalista the ash how do we trade those
2:37:53
how do those go through ambessa also another pick that's quite strong right now by is another y they're both going
2:37:58
to be banned away though the two junglers that have been towards the top of the priority list um Ash vars they're
2:38:04
the biggest ones for me uh is DRX are they just going like they have to start
2:38:10
Banning them now because they have to ban both I think or none of them so you just have to see exactly what's going to
2:38:15
happen because they've also been permanently Banning AIA throughout this whole series to try and take it away from CLA so I
2:38:23
he's had some good a games but it's not a champion that he's necessarily known for I'd rather see them ban the Ash and
2:38:30
the varis but they will ban the azir here so it guarantees uh that as long as Protestant ban one of the two here in
2:38:36
this final slot that they should be able to pick one of those up alternatively could go for the ambessa first pick and
2:38:42
still very strong right now and there's no Rumble in this game as UK's LeBlanc
2:38:47
is taken away a second time yeah going to be removing that one so now Varys or
2:38:55
Ash or just neither of them and I assume it's going to be neither of them um the kalista is a big one she's been banned
2:39:01
throughout the entire Series so likely that that one is just going to be taken away unless they're okay with playing
2:39:07
the ash into it Ash has obviously been a pick into the kalista quite a few times and so they're going to ban the ash away
2:39:14
hope for a Varys first pick and then allow lazy field to Plate kalista into the varis which not NE it's not
2:39:20
necessarily the greatest match up better into as I think they're kind of hoping to play it the other way they're like hoping kalista gets picked and they get
2:39:26
the varis um but they could have traded it differently I would have rather seen the kalista ban here or a varus ban the
2:39:33
ash one's a little bit peculiar I think varus wins out the bottom Lane matchup there a lot of Versatility in terms of
2:39:38
how his scaling works so it just makes a lot of sense the hype would pick this up it's one of the picks he's known for as
2:39:44
well um and lazy feel isn't as uh you know well versed let's say on the
2:39:49
kalista I'm not saying he can't play it but it's not a pick he has often played in Challengers or in kaspa cup banned a
2:39:56
lot cuz it's very strong we'll see if they have a different answer here the ambessa can be quite strong in dearis as
2:40:02
we're just going to see the Shia locked in well Zino and the rata glass coming
2:40:08
out here so kalista rata very powerful bottom Lane if they do end up locking that one away I think it's a bit of a
2:40:14
no-brainer is what it feels like to me hold off on both of their solo Lanes as well to try and keep the ambigu
2:40:20
ambiguity as high as possible does feel really good um to bolster the kalista
2:40:26
into a lane where she is outraged and can give you a little bit more power there and the only other pick they could
2:40:31
be thinking of is Draven but I don't think that's what we're going to see here it's pretty obvious to get the nus here as well with a lot of that support
2:40:37
pool pinched here as Morgan the Lord on his Renekton there it is the Renekton
2:40:42
makes it all the way through the entire Series without being picked or banned and Morgan is like oh yeah by the way
2:40:48
this is my Champion really strong setup here for bro in terms of their early
2:40:54
game the kalista looks like it is going to be the the pick that we expected yeah come through there some hesitation here
2:41:00
perhaps just talking about what they want to ban after this I uh in fact already wrote it down um before the
2:41:07
Nautilus was locked in because uh felt like a little bit of a no-brainer as soon as the ambessa sorry the uh Rado
2:41:14
was locked in so some other picks that you know we've seen in the past be quite strong uh in this meta are like the
2:41:20
silus but doesn't feel great to lock that one in here as bro right now necessarily feels pretty good on the DRX
2:41:27
side though really Broly right kind of uh suits what they're looking for n going to be taken away from huk
2:41:33
certainly something that does suit his aggressive play style although it does feel a little bit out of left field n
2:41:39
Renekton though very powerful the Zyra the Zyra and the N do give you the
2:41:45
opportunity to play a strong 80 mid um so that's something perhaps they were a little bit concerned about and even the
2:41:51
potential Flex of a Renekton into mid could be possible but less likely in current year uh we'll see the or taken
2:41:58
away again this leaves the jacks up it's been entire series he made it through was band when the Sani was up but now
2:42:05
left available gragas blind very safe does give you the mid counter pick for
2:42:11
ucal also gives you the opportunity to go towards some ad in the mid lane if you would like to as well um so
2:42:17
certainly a lot of options there as far as at least getting a larger damage profile
2:42:22
this is where things get tough for uh oh the brand I was wondering what okay closer just locks in yo that's like
2:42:29
that's that's what we're doing that's that's how it's going to work out sure there's not a whole lot of setup for the
2:42:35
ASO I mean you have the Nautilus ult but can be quite strong but blind of
2:42:40
course I thought it was going to be Lilia but I I kind of like the brand you know like it's so like there's no range
2:42:47
on DRX yeah I mean you just burn them to death and you know it feels pretty good
2:42:52
when you also have this really beefy front line you have the Renekton and the n and then you have a Yas and now we're
2:42:58
going to fight fire with fire here with ambessa mid which we saw in kespa cup actually was debuted debuted by Maple
2:43:06
yeah um which is really cool stuff of course it was the last tournament of his career now I think that there's a lot of
2:43:13
ways to get access to the varis here for the side of DRX they have the ability to
2:43:18
kind of get through that front line with the Hostile takeover potentially they also have uh xinia is very beefy can get
2:43:24
close the gap then you have cast to split the team in half and then M besta can just cut through all of that front line and hit hype as the final Target
2:43:31
then the followup is definitely there but if the fights get slowed down if they're for any reason playing a neutral
2:43:38
game where they can't engage quickly or they don't have map control or Vision that brand tick damage is just going to
2:43:43
keep burning we may have a game where you see that damage off the charts for the brand when we see that post game
2:43:49
screen and he's ending up being the MVP yeah I uh I'm really I I already love
2:43:56
fist Dr here in the lck for the lck cup uh just because I wasn't expecting drafts to look quite this off the- wall
2:44:03
but this is a really fun one Brandon Yasuo as our mid jungle on the side of the Bros and then this Mega Brawl
2:44:10
composition from DRX the amount of go in we can't go out on this team is
2:44:16
absolutely absurd plus then they have the gra to create as much chaos as possible so that when they audaciously
2:44:23
charge forward um they can find you know those uh those stragglers those targets that have been left out to dry the
2:44:29
biggest question mark for me Atlas is going to be this yasu works well with the brand in the mid 2v2 with jungle but
2:44:35
outside of it if they fall behind it is going to be a tricky game with both the yaso and the Renekton falling behind in
2:44:40
a big way not necessarily able to pick up the slack so this early game like games one and two going to be critically
2:44:46
important I would 100% agree with you wolf this is a whole lot of fun game three the decider between bro and DRX
2:44:54
let's get into [Music]
2:45:07
it all right welcome ladies and gentlemen it is time to get into the
2:45:12
final game of our first series of the LK cup bro on the blue side blue side so far has been 100% sucess uccessful and
2:45:20
so if you are a bro lever that certainly does help you out as far as uh giving
2:45:25
you some optimism almost said optimism like an idiot I caught myself though
2:45:30
don't you worry about that make sure you get your flags in the chat though if you are a DRX believer maybe you're just a
2:45:37
huge Rich fan you know from way back in his HS career until now maybe you just
2:45:42
love 2018 KT and I would not blame you for that so you're voting for youal want
2:45:47
to throw that DX flag in there make sure you do so and please if you could gift a sub to Brenan Valdez as well because he
2:45:54
cannot sub because his account is Korean uh and it's really difficult thankfully I made mine in Australia and so
2:46:01
therefore I was able to do so um but uh some of us are not so lucky that's why of course gon had to ask for herself uh
2:46:08
as well uh she was under the bus a little bit there I'm just asking for one because you know the people being so
2:46:14
nice uh I don't have any excuse exactly um but uh Clos I looked it up he has
2:46:20
100% win rate on yaso one game 100% win rate oh that's my favorite sample size
2:46:26
yeah he is a a wind bro connoisseur cuz he he he does seem like the type of player would be a big yaso enjoyer you
2:46:32
know what I mean oh yeah it feels like it was 100% he's still a fairly young player he's been around the LSK for a
2:46:38
while but you know was a trainy and then a sub behind Faker on T1 in 2021 but uh
2:46:43
you know that when he first played League of Legends when he was like 16 he was like yeah y for me probably played earlier than that but you know what I
2:46:49
mean like in his early formative years 100% of y m definitely um that was off
2:46:56
like he was a z main until he was the Y main okay that's the that's the energy he gives me um and that is absolutely
2:47:02
fine youal fighting with closer here just a little bit of course ambessa has a whole bunch of buttons that do a whole
2:47:08
lot of stuff there's still some dashing to be done here from closer as well minions to deal with as well but down to
2:47:14
about 100 health is youal drinking that potion as much as possible down to the shield both of these Champs are you know
2:47:20
cooldown based obviously Essa has energy but it's you know not really a huge limiting factor and they want to
2:47:26
continue to press their buttons nonstop so it's a crazy match up oh handshake here very polite is endle but probably
2:47:32
going to kill the person he just shook hands with at least going to give it a good old go the college try as as you
2:47:40
will the early game going really well for the kalist here before hype has been able to layer much poke um he did go
2:47:46
halil of blades interestingly and not the any of the other variants that we have seen actually I kind of don't mind
2:47:53
that so there are a couple of schools of thought right you can see the low range on the side of DRX and you can be like well I can go on hit and I probably feel
2:48:00
okay about it or you can say Well they're going to have to stand around they have no range is now hype in a
2:48:05
little bit of trouble here sponge making his way over wind does become lightning The Flash has to come out they're going to accept that one for the moment
2:48:12
towards the bottom Lane though is H get some Vision down this pillar of flame could do a bunch of work the hook goes
2:48:18
WI though it's closer he's going to turn up great handshake comes in as there's the wind wall sponge going to have to
2:48:23
flash away lazy field doing the same thing and another pill comes through and the bailout not going to be working this
2:48:29
time first blood and AA strength going over to hype and another hook connects as Polo pick up the first pal of the of
2:48:36
the the tournament my friend he's definitely getting it this guy's so good looking very good so far and man we have
2:48:43
had some aggressive early games a lot of it been around those grubs but in this
2:48:48
particular case just in this bottom Lane it's the Rome from closer that's a big difference maker UK does not match said
2:48:55
Rome and just a num advantage that they have there and you know hype's incredibly low early on in this play
2:49:01
zoned out but he's still alive so he can still offer that damage P when he rejoins look at what's happening as
2:49:06
ambessa is backing ukala is leaving you can see there's already a roaming closer
2:49:13
coming down here and bro just completely or sorry DX just completely outnumbered here and they're trying their best I
2:49:18
mean a good win becomes lightning coming through here from sponge they're trying their best but they just cannot win this fight the bailout will only buy time way
2:49:26
too much damage here it's the most value I've seen out of the tiny wind wall as well you know wind wall at this level
2:49:31
just really isn't that large but that choke point also not that large as that's a very happy humu there after
2:49:38
picking up a whole lot of value here for his team only a couple of assists for him but double kill for hype that's
2:49:44
absurd I mean with the brand damage that early on I mean it really does stack up in those longer and when you don't have
2:49:49
your ambessa showing up to to offer anything back to get on top of these squishy damage threats you're just not
2:49:55
going to be able to win that that fight unfortunately sponge did the best he could but won't be enough well Morgan
2:50:02
just going to be feasting on these minions as you can see and Rich doing okay he's actually uh keeping up in farm
2:50:09
quite comfortably of course Gras is pretty good at nullifying almost every lane match up as Clos taken a bit of
2:50:15
damage here from UK as we can see both of them had very recent teleported back to Lane Morgan's turning up let's see
2:50:22
what's going to happen here as sponge already getting to work on these grubs I believe the first one was taken by huk
2:50:28
and indeed it was so it should be two to one no feed of strength going to be com Down The Flash Forward here as the ruthless Predator comes down the knock
2:50:34
up from closer to follow up lazy feels on the floor and the Bros they did not appreciate that game two lost no they
2:50:41
certainly did not and I think they are appreciating the early game lead that they have here in this one first Blood
2:50:48
picked up by them early will be able to get two out of three grubs and look at the lead that hype is holding on to here
2:50:54
on vars to get a pick that he's known for I mentioned it earlier on in this series already has his Dirk online
2:50:59
starting to stack a tier he is just going to be such a huge threat in this game and you can see lazy still falling
2:51:05
further and further behind this is a ranata that's left to catch the farm here and this is just unfortunately a
2:51:11
lot of greed to be frank for DRX in this situation they have no control over the zone and once again UK cannot join the
2:51:17
fight pretty happy about how that one's going Edgar sitting pretty comfortably here
2:51:23
he's like yeah I want to stop looking now that was a really good bit and let's just uh Edgar of course has been known
2:51:29
to be very passionate about all of the teams that he has coached um one of our more famous ones here in the lck all
2:51:37
storied and good to see him happy here in the first series or at least for now
2:51:43
now of course anything can happen first Blood doesn't necessarily mean you definitely take the victory as second
2:51:48
third and fourth you know G two so far first blood has a 50% win rate that is pretty close to that 57% win rate that
2:51:55
first Blood had um based on the stats that were released by fron earlier on um
2:52:00
something like that there is a there's a segue there yeah really like it that much I I I'm concerned about how muted
2:52:07
UK's been in this game you know he's been he had that aggressive trade earlier but otherwise hasn't really interacted that much it's just been
2:52:13
catching waves and this just means bro are first on the RO first on the aggression sponge level six here but
2:52:19
isn't going to be able to cut anybody off and you know if you STI stick around hok's like yep I'll just keep burning
2:52:24
you he's got his burn online he's ready to to really put some hurt onto the DRX
2:52:30
members here slowly over time the Drake has spawned no one has taken it once again youal catching this wave here but
2:52:37
there's no setup for varus you know we see hot going towards the top side of the map here so we're not going to see an early Drake take for bro just yet
2:52:45
there's a timing window here where DRX could potentially set something up yeah we'll see whether DRX can actually
2:52:51
find a little bit of a window into this game so far not massive amount behind as far as gold is concerned but I just feel
2:52:58
like the map is in Bros control they should be able to uh utilize that in
2:53:03
order to create a larger Advantage as the game continues closer with those couple of assists he is down a little
2:53:09
bit of farm but you can see as he moves closer and closer towards item number one this yo is going to become a real
2:53:15
problem s side Lanes going to become a thing that uh d is going to find difficulty dealing with unless UK can
2:53:21
get some advantages on this Esser and make himself a threat Morgan fighting
2:53:26
against Rich this Top Lane is just not going to be that interesting guys um it's going to be barrels and and Lego
2:53:32
crocodiles and that's that's about it at least it's the the ren toy um it is it
2:53:38
is that's my go-to Morgan can be trusted to go for the cool SK yeah he he knows what's up he is Mr Renekton after all
2:53:46
this is a cannon though so that ain't great going to be moving up here towards his top side oh the disengage CK there
2:53:52
from rich is gorgeous and the brand all he can do is W Lumber slowly towards you
2:53:58
yeah I suppose H could have flashed towards Rich there but just a really well taxi or something yeah it was a
2:54:04
really well placed cast there from R uh knowing exactly what he needed to do to get out of that situation and prevent himself from flashing um and that being
2:54:13
said you know on the other side of the map because of that uh you know it's a successful deny on the gank and they get the draag out of it so DRX bouncing back
2:54:20
a little bit here in this game getting a small golf clap from the DRX side because it's still a pretty tough game
2:54:26
State here but lazy F also massively up on CS despite being down on gold and down on kills going to pick up a plate
2:54:31
here split with andil as well so it's not all doom and gloom there is still some hope here and if they can get one
2:54:37
team fight win they're right back in it and the fza strength situation looking okay here for DRX they've picked up
2:54:43
their first objective of course they need a couple more if they are actually going to solidify that but this bottom
2:54:48
Lane out of turret is extraordinarily low the laning power of this rata kalista is working exactly as well as it
2:54:56
says on the 10 you know this is an incredibly powerful Lane we've known it for a very long time but it's good to see that they're actually putting it
2:55:02
through its paces and making it do what it needs to in order to give the give them the advantages that they want in
2:55:07
this earlier stage of the game and it doesn't always work that well into the varis but with the Nautilus here they
2:55:12
abusing the melee support incredibly well hype didn't take uh the Comet or anything like that try to poke his way
2:55:18
into advantages just wants to sit back he's got three kills so he's feeling okay but at least lazy field is getting more back bro will be able to get these
2:55:25
grubs as you mentioned the satisfaction of watching bran take grubs oh never gets old yeah it's very uh very fun to
2:55:32
see that'll be their first um objective feet taken since they did get all three
2:55:38
so five grubs here for this comp that's already got a pretty strong Side Lane little bit scary
2:55:44
absolutely if uh Kos gets himself into a side lane which is exactly what he's doing now this yaso could really start
2:55:51
to run away with it as far as these uh towers are concerned see what lazy field
2:55:56
can get done though does have control of this minion wave for the moment and so closer is just going to have to grab this as it does come past
2:56:02
some reset opportunities here for this kalista as we got 3 minutes until the hexte dragon is going to be spawning
2:56:09
atakan going to be coming up in 8 minutes time and we've got a rift Herald on the docket next it's up in 2 minutes
2:56:15
I love I love this by the way we were talking about it just a little bit and there are just a lot of objectives that at all times there's always
2:56:22
something coming up yeah right um in fact right now there's three things coming up yeah I feel like this is like
2:56:28
it's only a minute 45 but it feels like the biggest low we've had all day so far yeah but you know there's a lot on the
2:56:34
docket as you put it um rich is is doing a really good job of clearing these waves and trying to proxy this now and
2:56:39
putting a little bit of pressure on to Morgan I think the way back into this game for DRX is just an incredible
2:56:44
engage from UK right like he has been pretty absent this game he's 00 Z at this moment in time has been catching
2:56:50
waves you know had a farm lead ear doesn't have it anymore but he's just been sitting on the ambessa and trying
2:56:55
to come online trying to be relevant if he gets into a team fight or wins out on the Sid Lane like this then uh that's
2:57:01
one way back into this game if he can put a lot of pressure onto this turret I mean this is huge for DRX really is
2:57:07
sponge in position right now as well hok going to move on over though so I don't think this Tower is going down right now
2:57:12
especially with Polo moving on in not able to land that one as lazy field taken down to 50% as hype is raining
2:57:18
down these arrows this Varys could become a problem as well because this poke is largely
2:57:24
unanswerable unless DRX just go for an Allin so they're going to have to really be ready to pull the trigger in this
2:57:30
game otherwise hype will just have free range and he's already 3 0 I think the
2:57:37
vision game is so important here for DRX they need to be able to see those opportunities they need to be to see
2:57:42
setups here for bro rotations over to Dragon what flank angles are being set because brand is also very vulnerable um
2:57:49
to getting blown up and caught as well he does a lot of damage but he's very squishy if he dies first in the fight you have a real Fighting Chance speaking
2:57:54
of brand yeah there's the Flash Forward but Rich catches him in the body slam
2:57:59
that's going to deny the stunt and means that humbo not going to be able to get anything from that one gives him the good old thumbs up you'll love to see it
2:58:06
rich on his time in Nim here domestically had a lot of really good gragas games and this is not going to be
2:58:12
an exception terms of how well he's neutralized this Renekton so far feel like it's it's looking like a bit of a
2:58:18
Renaissance for Rich I feel like he also had a pretty good time in the opening um tournament as well uh even though the
2:58:25
top laners didn't necessarily win out as the hook comes through from Paulo gets the knock up onto Rich sorry about the
2:58:30
cter curse as yeah I think huk might have the damage does find himself the E
2:58:36
there's the stun beautifully done Sears him down that is a uh medium rare gragas
2:58:41
in the Top Lane well fortunately though for DRX they already got first turret blood in the bottom side with uh the
2:58:48
push from UK so at least this turret going down isn't going to be the end of the world for them and we're still
2:58:53
waiting to see who's going to get that feat of strength DRX having bottom side control means they also have pry for this Drake so rich bought some time up
2:59:00
there his Cask was beautiful even though it wasn't enough to save him once again onto hok there that means that they will
2:59:07
look to take a two Drake lead and that could be something that really keeps them hanging into this game if they can
2:59:12
secure it the big problem the elephant in the room is the brand though you know he picked up that kill does have his
2:59:17
LeAndre all ready is just going to become a bigger and bigger threat the longer this game goes on so as DRX we
2:59:23
really are priced into taking the Stak Rich has teleport so he can join into this fight but they gave up a lot of
2:59:29
control they're just letting bro spill in and so that Advantage they had moments ago is now kind of gone yeah and
2:59:35
this is feeling like the closest game so far of this series there not a whole lot in it 2,000 gold might feel like a lot
2:59:42
but as you can see with these objectives both team uh just neck and neck as far
2:59:47
as as that is concerned even if this Dragon goes down another object objective is going to need to be taken
2:59:53
on either side make this one happen so very interesting can DRX find
2:59:58
this Allin angle that they're looking for Rich has grouped up with the rest of his team level two Alti has been secured
3:00:05
as well UK has a huge opportunity if he can get out of that side lane to make an impact here but he's still clearing the
3:00:10
wave and the Poke is real they've got poke from both the brand and that vars
3:00:16
Morgan slowed down a little bit here UK a little bit apprehensive to follow up with his jungler as Morgan's going to be
3:00:22
pushed away does have the Dominus available no flash though is now rich in that brush does find the angle here
3:00:28
under hok there's the knock up hok getting himself out of the way though and he might actually be safe sponge cut
3:00:34
down where he stands and the brand survives another Hook is going to land there because poo does not miss those
3:00:41
Morgan very very low though as lazy field doesn't get the execution on the Rend and now it's hype he has that range
3:00:47
Advantage the fade call though may have baited them out hype gets knocked up but there's no followup it's just po that
3:00:52
does go down the blinking health bars on both sides the knock up onto lazy field
3:00:58
that is a lot of damage there as in goes UK Cal to lock down lazy field does get
3:01:04
the bailout closer utilizing that wind well so beautifully but now can UK
3:01:10
survive this is that the triple yes it is and DRX they're on the board and in a
3:01:15
big way a quiet early game for you oh boy he was on a w well things turning up
3:01:24
in a big way here for DRX with Rich committing the teleport they're on the dragon now but a quiet early game for
3:01:30
ucal and he really blows up this fight here really nice usage of the brush
3:01:35
there from Rich they get on top comach and yes he survives here for so long and they end up losing out on Sponge because
3:01:42
of it but look at Lazy field he's late to the fight but he's full health and this kalista in these types of Scrappy fights is just so incredibly strong
3:01:49
everyone is so low Health it's hard to actually get in there and finish off lazy field positioning is great hides
3:01:55
behind andil uses the fates call and even the varus outranges her kalista can actually do so much in these fights as
3:02:01
hype is just not Landing these knockup does come down but he's able to Marshall pose and kite his way out then UK says
3:02:06
I've had enough finally flashes in picks up a ton of gold in this exchange as
3:02:12
well again spent most of the time in this game under turret but sets up the initial engage onto the and then
3:02:18
finishes cleans up the fight with all those dashes well played showcasing his mechanics on the Champions three kills
3:02:24
for the ambessa two items online absolutely massive fro still with a
3:02:29
slight gold Advantage but it was really starting to look like the game was running away with the Bros and now it's
3:02:36
even closer than it was before po possibly out of position here at the same time the hail of arrows is going to
3:02:42
slow down sponge he has to use the ultimate good handshake there from Andel as okay The Herald is going to lose
3:02:49
interest Paul is just going to be cut down though that is going to be the bailout successful but immediately it's locked up again lazy field trying to
3:02:56
find another angle here to get even more aggressive but a one for one in the end not going to spell out too much yeah if
3:03:03
DRX gets this heral that is fat of strength done for them so really important the sponge that goes down here
3:03:09
that's it's very difficult to go turn back and take that heral after a trade one for one you the one with the gold
3:03:14
lead right now but you can see lazy f is dead even with hype now having a CS lead for most of the game
3:03:19
but those three early kills for hype pushed him into the advantage but the kalista again hanging on to a threat in
3:03:25
terms of relevance and how she scales into this game it's been a tough time for sponge he is really trying to do the
3:03:32
best as a melee Champion as he can here into this really frustrating long range vars as well as the brand going back
3:03:40
into this setup here you can see heavily committing to taking out Paulo they really want to get this Herald because
3:03:45
it speat of strength for them handshake here is decent and you can see that the Crescent guard buys enough time to
3:03:50
actually turn this one around they will be able to get the bail out on the sponge but it's a trade one for one does critically though deny the herald yep
3:03:58
hostile take over actually getting a whole bunch done there as well really buys a whole lot of time so nicely
3:04:03
played there by Andel so sponge does clear up the red buff and we're clicking
3:04:09
uh we're ticking closer to this arakan spawning going to be North Side once
3:04:15
again as it generally is we've had a fair few kills but he's still red so never you mind it's going
3:04:22
to be the voracious boy this red is my face is going to be end of this we so is is the is the BET like the
3:04:29
amount of uh like ruinous aons that we get is it based on this week or this
3:04:35
whole season just this week I think even if it was this whole season I still would have said zero starting to look
3:04:41
like you might have been wise uh to that Atlas um to to make that decision as DRX
3:04:46
again they still really want this Herald they have pryo right now hok is not able to put any damage into DRX just yet all
3:04:53
right the Lord's flank angle is looking a bit dangerous here as the rift Arrow going to be secured by huk Morgan can
3:05:00
Flash and gets on top of lazy field but the F goal is pretty good hype untouched though until UK gets into that backline
3:05:07
still it's going to be a flash out hype still in pretty good position huk dealing with Rich at this point in time
3:05:13
but the hero that is our Lord is going to get over the wall and then back over again UK using all of these dashes and
3:05:21
it's just not going to be enough to grab the brand humach is just so slippery this game it's so hard to to lock down
3:05:27
that final bit of his health his positioning has been great he's going to be able to layer enough damage in here now it looks like to actually take out
3:05:34
this OT and if he actually dies there you know without his leandre's damage I don't know if they actually could take
3:05:39
this and that was speat of strength as well this is going to be Pro being able to upgrade their shoes absolutely some
3:05:46
fancy Nikes is now available for this squad and looking at it like you can see the the swifties as well upgraded
3:05:52
swifties that feels pretty fantastic for you varis and this a few good things I can get this fight is so split look at
3:05:58
where hype and Pao are Paulo is basically just a bodyguard in this situation while offering a lot of CC as
3:06:05
well and you can see the hype becomes a Target here for Uka gets over the wall positions incredibly well uses the
3:06:11
terrain to guarantee that when in his most vulnerable moment he could still get out and that puts UK unfortunately
3:06:17
on the wrong side of the fight to actually go clean up the right side where hok narrowly escaped so really
3:06:22
good positioning from the new ad carry KT rollster player on loone here to bro
3:06:28
he looked great in kespa cup as a big reason why they won that title and he's looking great in this final game of the series as well three early kills
3:06:34
utilizing the gold really well in that last fight too y amazingly done and they've moved up to that uh pretty
3:06:40
comfortable 3,000 gold lead at this point in time and you can see there the
3:06:45
gold really did come down to a pretty nice spot but once again bro have writed the ship might be their first dragon of
3:06:52
the game as well once again it's going to be a mountain Soul which is kind of nutty I'm finding it hard to keep up
3:06:58
with everything normally we've talked about which Soul it is far before the dragon has in fact spawned and being
3:07:03
killed um but there's a lot of stuff here you know very different yeah and
3:07:09
we've also got the buff for arakan still for another minute so bro can be pretty
3:07:14
aggressive and I feel like that certainly suits a player like closer who is now going to drive Shelly into this
3:07:20
big gun in the mid lane yeah Morgan also Sid laning on the top side so this 4-1 setup here is incredibly powerful and
3:07:28
they have the withdrawals so I mean they're not vulnerable for anything they can go in chain the corruption does come
3:07:34
down turret is getting a little bit angry knock up onto sponge but not one that closer wants to follow up on and
3:07:39
they'll take two turrets for their trouble a third possibly going down as well if Morgan can get his uh minions in
3:07:46
position but he's not quite a B to do so the rest of bro now just going to try and set up for a little bit of a gank brush 30 seconds on the clock as far as
3:07:53
that uhan Revival is concerned this just the stalemate here that bro in when the
3:07:59
minions get here DX just trying to group yeah flash over is great handshake for the disengage out of Andel but in comes
3:08:05
Morgan he's pre- alted as well just trying to keep them busy it is going to be Andel going down first up but you can
3:08:12
see there is a whole lot of uh getting sent back to the Fountain here for the Bros hype just trying to stand in
3:08:18
position and deliver this damage youal should be able to take him out though and there it goes that's in fact just a
3:08:24
kill I believe yeah uh because hype didn't die fast enough nicely done there by DRX I mean the rest of the gold
3:08:30
that's picked up there too is significant but I think what they got in return a lot of map control a lot of deep Vision it's not it's not like it's
3:08:38
a trade up for bro in terms of gold or anything like that but it was worth the risk I would say at this point in time
3:08:45
definitely getting a little bit L Fair with it here um and the is full health
3:08:50
and it's new turrets on this patch so they kind of do hurt but I get the idea especially because Morgan has teleport
3:08:56
so if he ends up dying and withdrawing same with uh closer if this fight were extended they could have just rejoined
3:09:03
uh and and it would have been fine but you know it was it was a little bit broken up so aren't able to really get the value from that they end up
3:09:10
dying yeah yeah slow yeah slow slow slow so that we can actually get a kill and
3:09:16
UK has has been you the early game was was quite uh absent let's say from him
3:09:22
he wasn't able to make the same room as that closer did but it's made some big impact impact plays from behind to keep
3:09:28
his team in this and they are still in this but I mean they Feats of Strength
3:09:34
did go over this next dragon fight will be critical for DRX to try to secure his sole Point here before this gets two off
3:09:40
the rails Cleaver done for UK I mean this is maybe the best fight they're going to get for the rest of the game
3:09:46
and it's not great but it's it's probably the best one yep and UK as well close to the highest level in the game
3:09:52
as you just saw and he still has a gold lead even though there's been five kills picked up by Clos and now po going
3:09:58
aggressive once again lazy field feels like he has a good angle and in fact he does change the corruption does nothing
3:10:04
and the exhaust comes on through there as well the bailout was on lazy fi he didn't even need it two on the floor huk
3:10:10
joins this yaso and down goes the Lord as well four on the ground for bro and
3:10:17
and DRX they run into the baron that was a huge ult from Mel as well at the end of the fight to guarantee they can clean
3:10:23
up house lazy field does a ton of that damage HBO survived for so long but
3:10:28
ultimately still is taken out he put a ton of damage in there but it wasn't enough and DRX picking up this Baron
3:10:34
will almost completely nullify the gold lead it's going to be about 10000 that's the difference between them after this
3:10:40
Baron is taken and it's going to guarantee they have objective control for the next fight as well you can see
3:10:46
how this fight breaks up again looking for hok as the target he lives for so incredibly long lazy field goes
3:10:53
incredibly low flashes over the wall has a Fates call for the re-engage and you see andil ult Fates with the uh hostile
3:10:59
takeover at the same time and there's just no one to get on top of lazy who survives with 150 Health just fantastic
3:11:06
me watch this again how low he gets before he goes over the wall avoids the chains of corruption which is really
3:11:11
unfortunately for bro a huge difference maker in this fight oh man
3:11:19
so well played by him and andil together and they front to back beautifully
3:11:29
done all right an incredibly close game after two one-sided stops it's crazy and
3:11:34
like I can understand like this level of motion yeah it's game it's the very first series of the year right this is
3:11:40
the LC cup we're not even in to like the full regular season of the lck yet and
3:11:46
already emotions of this to yeah possible angle here as rich is very
3:11:51
healthy as Morgan looking to chase after him can they hold him in position that's going to be the question as the turret goes down in the mid lane oh wait the
3:11:59
way oh he's out there and the Bros are on able to stop him he's down into the
3:12:04
bottom Lane and he's pushing with UK the rest of DX is going to be pushing I think the call was probably initially
3:12:11
hey Rich is a lost cause let's hard push mid and bottom but then Rich gets out with the TP as well no one can shut him
3:12:17
down and they get two turrets for it he doesn't die and this Baron is 4,000 the Red Bull power play here yeah and it's
3:12:25
only going to get worse it's one and a half minute left on this Baron as well so there is a lot more time to get even
3:12:31
more done here with this buff and they can also utilize it to get soulle point with this mountain Drake that is up and
3:12:37
available sponge already getting to work on that one man the this game is just completely flipped on its head who said
3:12:44
that this is going to be all about snowballs because this one has gone both ways like about seven times so far this
3:12:51
game croner has definitely said that's Challengers baby at least three times at least three times in front of the television over on the space but look at
3:12:58
what hok has in his inventory right he's got his old the only thing he really is missing is The Flash but he's got an arm
3:13:04
guard for survivability he has the tier three Sor shoots shoes you know two
3:13:10
incredibly strong items the slow and the burn like he is ready he is set up to still carry one of these team fights but
3:13:16
they need to buy time for him by space for he's been the Target in so many of these fights and yes he does a lot
3:13:21
before he dies and he's been positioning really well but he's still you know pushed out of these fights and isn't given the time to actually maximize his
3:13:27
damage they don't have a mage midlaner so they really need him to do well speaking of yeah Morgan going to have to try and protect him here as a Flash
3:13:34
Forward great cast but maybe he's now it no he's not lazy field is going to be able to find him hanar going to go down
3:13:39
extraordinarily low the bailout is it going to be working here and the answer is it doesn't actually have to because
3:13:44
he doesn't even go down oh never mindly burn will do it and hok doesn't expend
3:13:50
his arm guard there so he's actually still got that he's able to realize like okay I think I've done enough here we
3:13:56
could just get out even if they don't get that kill there he's like probably want to have that for the next objective fight want to make sure we could shut
3:14:01
down DRX from getting that mountain Soul so makes a wise choice there in my opinion cuz I don't think they would have turned it even if he was able to go
3:14:08
golden there so holds on to that critical item uh we have his flash for the next dragon as well now the baron is
3:14:14
done so while this is a great proactive play from the sponge I don't think this is going to be the back breaker necessarily especially because he goes
3:14:21
down and expend his flash in the process here yeah that c actually really
3:14:26
beautiful there from Rich with the full information of the rest of his team moving on down from the top guarantees the kill onto hok and in the end it is
3:14:34
going to be him able to lock down his opposite number so a one for one and
3:14:39
honestly the game feeling like it's switched all the way back towards DRX especially with this Soul point that
3:14:46
they have up and available with this brly composition that's quite short range they can utilize these shields so
3:14:52
effectively if they do collect that mountain Soul not to mention the added tankiness it's just always going to be good now you know some of the other tier
3:14:59
three boots that we could see come through here the upgraded swifties for hype uh which will give him tons of movement speed and okay hold that
3:15:06
thought yeah that's going to be Morgan taking a whole lot of damage here from UK who's just not taking any damage at all Morgan realizing that he just needs
3:15:11
to deal with a minion wave and he's not even going to be able to do that and UK collect his six dying so far today in
3:15:19
this game I mean that might just be an inhibitor to go down hpe did get those tier three boots right after I said that
3:15:24
but and he's going to be really fast and hard to lock down they're not going to commit heavily to that inhibitor just going to back off take that small win
3:15:32
but I I do think this game is winnable on either side like yes DRX have a lot of map control right now they've got some deep Vision as you can see around
3:15:38
the red buff down there on the bottom side looking to try to grab this Scuttle here top side as well is sponge but
3:15:43
won't be able to do it looks like this one is going hok's way sponge not even going to go for the steel and this this
3:15:48
next fight is is so critical right it's either going to be over the baron or what could be Mountain soul for DRX and
3:15:54
I think the the main characters here are going to be hok and hype um across all 10 players could be the most high impact
3:16:00
and who kills them or tries oh the flash has to be invested as rich just finds
3:16:06
him that's a big one oh you and that is that ultimate's on a very low cool down at this point in the game as well level
3:16:13
16 on this gragas so he should have that up and available and the few seconds time that we have the baron spawning is
3:16:20
having a day out today he really is I mean he he did since the opening event he's having a great time even when he
3:16:26
was playing uh Pike the bottom Lane yeah yeah good old support rich and uh yuka's got a ga getting that flash off of brand
3:16:34
is one of the tools gone he still has his uh arm guard I was mentioning earlier UK on the flank here looking for
3:16:39
maybe grabbing hog once again but whiffs it yeah going to be spotted out on that Ward and so hok knows that he can just move out of the way and with that public
3:16:47
execution now on cool down maybe the Bros are going to feel like they can possibly fight Baron has just spawned
3:16:53
this second how much can hype and hambach get done to DRX in the neutral
3:16:58
fight oh don't overextend Bros okay they do get the vision they know what's going on as you can see Morgan champing at the
3:17:05
fit really wants to get a fight started the rest of DRX they're going to peel
3:17:11
away look for an opportunity Morgan going to get hand shock here as lazy field getting some sticks into him
3:17:16
little bit dangerous here but he does get over the wall UK's coming online fairly soon here he's still on the flank
3:17:22
catching either hak or hype will massive is the teleport that's a bit of a short one but Rich gets himself into position
3:17:28
hbar goes golden but he's the jungler and he's just going to get executed he does a bit of damage on his way out but
3:17:35
that is not going to be enough and the Bros is not going to be able to stop this Baron they might be able to deny a
3:17:40
dragon I guess but even that's up in 20 seconds and this Baron isn't going to last very long at all the kills have
3:17:46
been even out but the gold is well and truly in the advantage of DRX and on their second Baron they might just be
3:17:53
able to win the game I mean the the whole mission for DRX is to try to find and kill hok even though he has the armu
3:17:59
guard he doesn't have Flash and he's just way too far up there finds himself isolated and once again UK makes the
3:18:06
play he's on the flank and once that that the damage is gone for brand there even if he tosses his old out it's not
3:18:11
alone going to be enough he needs time he needs some additional space bought by the front line to actually get that burn
3:18:16
through with some poke coming through from hype if you actually get engaged on you've already lost you have to be buying some time or you have to be
3:18:23
burning for some time before the fight actually goes off if you're going to be successful they did not set that up DRX
3:18:28
are proactive they pick him and that's Baron plus Mountain Soul here and I
3:18:33
don't know if I can call this a close game anymore it is looking like we are looking for DRX to close this one out
3:18:39
it's not over till it's over but this is kind of the snapping of the neck of bro yeah you can have your Feats of Strength
3:18:46
will just take soul and two Barons and that should be enough and to be perfectly honest I do not doubt them DRX
3:18:53
looking so so strong and oh hook going to go wide there as rich just going to
3:18:59
use his Burly finesse to get himself out of the way body slam beautifully timed they take down the
3:19:05
turret and the rest of DRX here towards his bottom side you count in the Top Lane the split is well and truly a foot
3:19:13
now they have good wave clear that's one thing they definitely have going for the them in terms of clearing this hok alone
3:19:19
is really going to make quick work of these waves closer as well if he's given some time won't take him too long UK is
3:19:24
just going to sit over here alone and take out this turret slowly but steadily they what they really want the real
3:19:29
prize is though an inhibitor 80 seconds left to go bro could save the pressure off here maybe there's a chance back
3:19:35
into this game yeah Clos you can see going a little bit aggressive onto Rich who has about 7 million health so he'll
3:19:43
be absolutely fine he's on that top inhibitor turret yeah that should be taken down here unless closer can make
3:19:48
something happen he throws out the ulti Morgan trying to get over there slices dice gets the stun but it's not going to be enough The Flash out from UK is
3:19:55
enough disengage and now Rich could be in trouble or he could just be way too tanky hype trying to get some damage
3:20:01
down here sponge taking a little bit but throws out the Cresent guard ucal in some trouble great knock up here from
3:20:07
closer he has to flash though to get out of the way the brosa fighting as hard as they can but it's just not quite enough
3:20:13
lazy field is inside the base I don't know whether that was necessarily the right call but it looked really cool and
3:20:19
Inhibitors are still going down for DRX it's a huge win here for DRX either way
3:20:25
but bro technically survive here as now all three Inhibitors have fallen both
3:20:31
Nexus turrets do at the moment stand and UK is really you know quietly the MVP of
3:20:38
this for DX because he pulls bro to the top side of this fight this then allows Rich to split tomok off and they don't
3:20:44
get the kill on UK not even close he has G so we can really push the issue here with this ultimate all the while you
3:20:50
know lazy feel on the back here is is untouched and sponge's Cresent guard absorbs a lot of the damage and yeah UK
3:20:56
will eventually get taken out by some of that burn damage from hog but it's you know I think if lazy field actually just
3:21:01
plays this a little bit more respectfully they probably end the game I like the Rush of Blood to the Head though and once again hats off to Andel
3:21:09
his hostile takeovers have been absolutely fantastic so far this uh this
3:21:14
game and that was once again another example of that you know wasting so much of the Bros time wasn't able to hit hype
3:21:21
which is a large reason why bro I think looked a little bit better in that um but still everybody else was well and
3:21:26
truly tied up and hype now just needs to turn that Durk into something and he's got six items same can be said for lazy
3:21:33
field with this arm guard that he also has which is a really interesting Tech as well I kind of like that often we do
3:21:39
see it on things like uh Kaiser but kis it's a different one you don't necessarily scare with as much of the AP
3:21:45
but uh certainly cool to have that St available it works really well with bailout too depending on how you utilize
3:21:50
it um can be quite tricky um you know your teammates do a little bit of damage for you then you get bailed out last
3:21:56
possible second as soon as you come out of the arm guard uh DRX I mean just letting the minions do the work here I
3:22:02
mean we have six Super minions spawning at a time with all these Inhibitors down bro have great wave clear which could
3:22:08
buy time but they're going to have to buy it for three more minutes if they're going to win this game and it's just so difficult to see it yeah huk is really
3:22:15
going to have to make this wave clear work for them and uh he's bran so it's it's pretty good to be honest it's
3:22:21
working okay so far yeah these Nexus turrets have not taken a lot of damage still rich is looking for that opportunity The Flash out from hype has
3:22:27
to be invested chains of corruption will be the trade it's a decent hook and Rich taking a lot here but are they actually
3:22:34
able to kill him that's the question the overextension from hok says no oh never mind he flashes away and he may actually
3:22:41
live because of course they have no range to speak of without few barrels fing they got to clear these these super
3:22:48
minions though and I mean the Nexus turret is still alive here comes the next wave it's only one here in the mid
3:22:53
lane hok living is so huge because now he can clear this and they live to tell the story of of what might happen for
3:22:59
the rest of this game I mean they're still in such a horrible spot let's not lie to ourselves here I want to be prop
3:23:05
optimistic here but it is a very very tough situation Elder spawns in 90 seconds here and that's going to be one
3:23:11
of the biggest challenges here that that bro have to face because they still have to deal with these super minions for just about 30 seconds longer than that
3:23:17
really about 45 and that's where things really come to a head yeah there are three Inhibitors down for like 2 minutes
3:23:25
and uh the baron is going to be up again in 30 seconds time so I just don't know whether you're going to be able to
3:23:31
survive with all of these supers just parading into your base and DRX team Elder at it's kind of crazy as the ulti
3:23:38
catches him and once again hok is just on the floor that broken armu guard
3:23:45
looking at him just sadly from his inventory and that will spell a baron
3:23:50
right on the spawn and DRX I think might be able to end it here at the third Baron is the CH yeah I don't know I mean
3:23:57
they're team Elder but they've been doing a lot of baring this game around as look hok here there's a
3:24:04
ward rich on him as well he's just a little bit greedy stepping that for four
3:24:10
to do Raptors here at this point trying to farm up that zonas but he goes down that's Baron into Elder Exodia three
3:24:17
Inhibitors down if you can't win with this one DRX we're going to have to have a talk yeah and I think that they
3:24:23
probably will I think you know with the the fact that Elder was put into the game to stop these sorts of situations
3:24:29
from happening means that I don't think that there's going to be uh much of a chance especially with these three
3:24:34
Inhibitors still down like how good is br's wave clear let's really find out
3:24:39
yeah I think not good enough um especially when he cannot stay alive when uh any of the members of DRX look
3:24:46
at him the Inhibitors will respawn in about 30 seconds here but I think that's
3:24:52
just enough time for DRX to get these waves going in the super minions are still already up here in all three lanes
3:24:58
so they're not just going to disappear yeah well rich is going to find an angle that's a beautiful cause po trying to
3:25:05
get out but once again huk is just left to the Wolves another hostile takeover
3:25:10
is decent but Polo's eaten by a dragon lazy feel is dancing around the battlefield and his dragon is hungry and
3:25:18
it's hungry for the first match win of the lck cup for DRX Teddy was unwell
3:25:24
today lazy field played in Challenger yesterday picked up player of the match and he may do it again here as DRX take
3:25:32
down the Casper Cup champions DRX showing up in a big way very few people
3:25:40
predicting them to win today and then even fewer still with Teddy injured sick
3:25:46
today unable to show up but lazy field came in had some tough early games had some tough Ling phases but stuck The
3:25:52
Landing Andel fantastic play on the ranada and they are able to take it in
3:25:58
the end despite some of the draft challenges they faced in this one as well I really feel like this was a great
3:26:05
showcasing of what this roster has to offer and who is the player of the match WF this is the big question cuz I'm like
3:26:12
I was sure that it was going to be Ando but after Rich had a game like this like that was absolutely out of control
3:26:18
UK really holding it together throughout the entirety of especially that last
3:26:24
game but even in his Aurora game where he really hard carried I don't know who do you give it to I think it's probably
3:26:30
going to be between UK and andil for me I ultimately ended up voting for andil I feel like he was the most consistent
3:26:36
player I probably would have gone that too but I think I mean you really could go for almost anybody even lazy field I
3:26:43
think overcoming the challenges of his big def in some of these games was impressive to see as well I think a lot
3:26:49
of narrative voters will be there for uh for Vietnam right and what a day to be a Vietnamese fan to watch this Morgan
3:26:56
versus lazy field lazy field comes out on top hok was the target man you can tell he's frustrated with how things
3:27:02
went but he played so incredibly well despite it and had a big role to play in this game but ultimately sometimes the
3:27:08
Bounty gets hunted he was found he was killed and the game ended DRX super
3:27:13
resilient in this final game the despite being kind of backs against the wall feeds of strength against them a lot of
3:27:20
deficits a lot of tough Champions to to scale with the kalista obviously the ambessa was a bit of a question mark
3:27:26
wasn't able to make a lot happen in the early game but UK did it when it mattered most when they had that great Target selection that's the kind of
3:27:32
thing you don't often see in a new team like this that's hasn't had that much time together obviously and has some
3:27:38
really young players on it like lazy field who's literally 17 is playing his debut series is to be able to identify
3:27:44
what the target is what the objective is to win a game from behind and to see this team do it this early on gives you
3:27:52
hope yeah and you you could see it as well they were like you could see the DRX just said if we kill the brand we
3:27:58
win the game and that's what they did time and time again and I swear this
3:28:04
veteran Rich voice in this team you can see it taking effect I feel like a lot
3:28:09
of these young players are just like oh heck yeah we got this and then lazy field gets that Rush of adrenaline after
3:28:15
these amazing TKS come in to start off these fights I mean I can see like we
3:28:20
were talking about this on the POG State earlier on like we can see how DRX can look good yeah and I think we had a
3:28:28
great example of that here in this final game of this series but I just hope the rest of the lck cup is more of this cuz
3:28:35
this was a great series of League of Legends to start us off it really was we had some questions about the yoso going
3:28:41
into this uh he made a great impact in the early game some fantastic RS but just kind of couldn't
3:28:47
later um watch the final moment here your boy Rich getting the getting
3:28:55
humach out of the fight and allowing the Exodia to just obliterate
3:29:04
them I missed you I really did so happy to see him back this man has some pop
3:29:10
off this year of lck you mentioned it you you know can see the angles for DRX we can see it for so many of our teams
3:29:17
but almost every team in the LSK you look at you go there's an angle I could see it I can believe and I feel like the
3:29:23
last few years we've had some teams that that you look at the roster and you're like well maybe next year or let's see how much they could develop but a team
3:29:29
like this we'll see how far they can go but they given us a lot of optimism I mean these are Kasa Cup champions they
3:29:34
just knocked out today exactly and that is no mean feat and uh UK 33.7k damage
3:29:40
is a lot more than I was expecting I felt like he did have a lot of s side laning um in this game not necessarily
3:29:46
involving himself that much but when he was there he was really there and really like no complaints here as far as how
3:29:54
this first series went neck and neck one thing that I do have a little bit of a problem with is that I think there are
3:29:59
too many comeback mechanics in the game like it felt to me like bro deserved to win that just because they were doing so
3:30:05
well in the early game and with the amount of comeback mechanics and ways to get back into the game DRX were able to
3:30:10
do so so that's a little bit of a that's sarcasm L gentlemen um just to let you know we uh in a more serious note we
3:30:17
have changed things up a little bit we're going to be revealing the P cuz we don't have PS anymore but have player of the match here um and then throwing to
3:30:24
the space so and the reason that has been changed is because it's no longer player of the game it is a one player
3:30:30
throughout the entire series which is why we were talking about you know the player that was consistently good over
3:30:35
both of them speaking of which it's going to be youal and I think that we don't really have too many complaints
3:30:41
outside of the Victor not looking great in game number one he's like well I've just decided to not die from that point
3:30:46
and that's precisely what he did he didn't play he played Aurora instead but Aurora
3:30:52
has done some of those cheeky Shenanigans um and she is now Beyond the Veil and we couldn't quite get her
3:30:57
picture and so we just threw tier in there instead he was deathless um in those last two games and both wins so
3:31:03
pretty impressive play uh from him overall really turned the game around in game three as well so I I think you
3:31:09
could have gone with a lot of players I'm not I'm not happy he got it he's one of my favorite players that's returning to the lck this year so I'm hyped yeah
3:31:16
me too and we are preparing the interview as well and I love this that we get the interview with UK right now
3:31:21
on his return let's throw it over to dear thank you very much guys this is De
3:31:28
for the first P interview translation ofc cup
3:31:39
congratulations is back after a very long time please say hello to your fans hello
3:31:46
I am the millionaire of
3:31:52
the how do you feel you guys got your first win for group Elder we came with the mindset of
3:31:59
winning even though we gave game one away we were still in the game so I
3:32:06
think we were all really just focused on winning the next
3:32:11
one what did you go into game one with what kind of mind
3:32:19
so Teddy is gone down with the flu and it wasn't the same it wasn't
3:32:26
really it was out of ordinary but I'm really glad that we were able to secure today's
3:32:31
Victory so lazy Phil was actually called up and the language barrier in
3:32:37
communicating and playing as a team on such short notice must have been so challenging but based on your mic check
3:32:44
it seemed like everything was good how is it no I think uh lazy feels actually
3:32:50
really trying hard to be on the same page with the rest of the team so it's
3:32:56
really been very helpful what would you like to say to Lazy feel lazy feel you're so
3:33:06
good you have some of these nicknames are the best blade of Jan or maybe X and
3:33:14
that was given to you for excelling at yasu and in game three you matched up against the yasu with your clean Essa
3:33:20
place and lived up to those nicknames yeah I think when I was
3:33:27
playing during that Amba game game three I actually did feel like I was going to
3:33:34
get P from my game plays so you will face four more
3:33:39
midlaners in the rest of lck cup so what would you like to say to them
3:33:46
take care of me you guys and I'm really looking forward to
3:33:53
the rest of the matches and that's the end of the interview from ukel and back to this space thank
3:34:01
you thank you very much deara as we get to hear dear's translation one more time
3:34:07
for the former a freaka freaks KT Thunder talk gaming and now DRX midlaner UK Cal getting the player of the match
3:34:14
welcome back to the space as it is DRX to get the first victory of the 2025 season uh and again lots of things to
3:34:21
talk about here chronicler what a statement performance from uko cuz obviously if you're in the lck
3:34:26
particularly if you work in it it's really hard to keep a consistent track of the LPL but it's not like UK not
3:34:32
individually but like his teams fun the talk obviously isn't necessarily a standout performer as you guys can't see
3:34:38
O's face but he he obviously know very well um but I I have heard good stories
3:34:44
about him individually and you see a performance like this you believe that immediately right what a comeback of
3:34:49
that player super cool and I think a big reason of why they were able to get the winner today um I got to say though on
3:34:56
the flip side as well the hype for bro taking a bit of a hit here started so
3:35:02
well um yeah did it was pretty good game one it felt great and I think part of
3:35:08
that is due to the drafting as well uh there was one part of the draft that we did enjoy but outside of that I feel
3:35:13
like particularly in game two but even in game number three Bon didn't really feel like they had comps that were as
3:35:19
well rounded as what was picked up uh by their opponents yeah I did want to bring
3:35:24
this point up because the brand in the zenz out this is actually uh bro vers FX
3:35:30
this is the first time we saw brand jungle in the lck into zenza same match up here and you saw from the other game
3:35:36
why this match up makes sense right zenza when he dives into you can just stun him you do so much damage like let
3:35:41
yes you can use the ult to block some of brand damage but he just bounces of everyone uh and the game you know was
3:35:46
looking good I didn't as you kind of saying Ma I feel like the cohesion between the comp wasn't there as much um
3:35:52
especially like The lethality varus started okay but I feel like playing the N into the clada is an ideal and then
3:35:57
later on you just couldn't cut through the bulk with the Lal varus really yeah so so they self counterpicked with no
3:36:04
cuz like the reason why Renata came up in the first place after her initial performances was because in naus the
3:36:10
match up is n unplayable cuz the ult is so telegraphed and then also you're playing and his only good source of
3:36:17
knockups is specifically that nus who already is going to be mitigated so it just feels like uh it's it's leading a
3:36:24
little bit too much into what the players like but it doesn't actually make that much sense also feels split cuz you have like you know brand and
3:36:29
varis are kind of happy for people to come into them and then to deal with them in that way but like yasto and nless reekon are wanted to dive in he
3:36:36
also playing into reada it just felt like the kesian wasn't there for the draft and you could see later on they
3:36:42
were kind of struggling with how to execute things I also think you know you talked about the self kind of B they also ended up playing into this Gras in
3:36:47
the Top Lane for the re which is always painful yeah but you know that was later on if they fell behind early on it was
3:36:54
all bro including in this fight down at the Drake pit at 16 minutes where you know it it was a nice cleanup I think
3:37:00
they get a couple kills at the end here but you're thinking wow Bros just coming on in and you know making it 70 8-0 at
3:37:06
this point I mean initially it looks good right uh they managed to get those picks H back stays alive but the health
3:37:12
bars get low and there's someone who is still very healthy right now now and it is it's not Cante it's the new cassant
3:37:18
it's ambessa and she's ready just to take over the fight what you see here as well though
3:37:23
is that I do think there's an opportunity to disengage and this is the point where bro is going to go back to
3:37:28
and realize if they back off there maybe give up one more member I think the situation is still salvageable but
3:37:35
credit to Lazy Feld as well I don't think that it was a perfect performance today but you are a player with such an
3:37:41
incredible amount of weight on you it's already stressful to sub in when a player has a as an emergency right Teddy
3:37:47
hopefully feeling better soon but then to not only do that but also as the first non- Korean player it's a really
3:37:54
big deal but as oing star of the show there was UK because as soon as he got those kills he was running the game yeah
3:38:01
well after that you're thinking okay Bros settle down a little bit and they do so just here at the heral at 20
3:38:08
minutes you're thinking okay this fight they clean up this should be the end of it as uh again a steel attempt doesn't
3:38:14
work out look awesome here right because of the way that lazy fi and unil Flash if they flash into their own backline I
3:38:21
think they actually have an opportunity to maybe play this out but Morgan was not spotted so as we roll the clip we're going to see this is a very split fight
3:38:29
they throw a lot into hok rich with a bit of an unfortunate ultar doesn't actually get it ambessa also doesn't get
3:38:34
on top of the brand and this is the moment where huk still makes it out and you're like okay maybe bro can still
3:38:41
make it maybe things are kind of okay even after the earlier dragon fight where the Essa got so fed I feel like in
3:38:48
highight the fact we talked about how hard it is for the asro to get ult off in this game like you r on the nor the fact he got a three-man Al there kind of
3:38:55
illustrates this isn't the norm for how fights are going to play out like that fight was that's the only one yeah that's everything they could have hop
3:39:01
for but not what they're always going to end up getting and I think they got a bit too much confidence from that going
3:39:06
into the next play I mean but I feel like when you're playing that type of composition you have the lead here I think at that point it was 13 to7 it's
3:39:13
good and this is where they broke over play their yeah this looks good for a second and then they realize the mistake
3:39:20
they made the moment lazy feel and yuk show up there I think they know that they're cooked because with a a
3:39:26
character like vars in particular you cannot be that far up if you don't know where the opponents are cuz with them
3:39:33
committing there this is basically where the game ends yeah and I I feel like the bot Lane kind of dropped the ball here
3:39:38
like nus missing the dredge line the AL on a non ideal Target the varis missing and you saw how low lazy field was if
3:39:45
any of those tools have been used better this fight could have been different it didn't start ideally but you're missing
3:39:51
some of your big tools to shut down some like a clist you're never going to win off the back of that so time to see how
3:39:56
the votes All Shook Up for our player of the match format as we take a look at the Highlight from our best uh I guess
3:40:03
uh plays here from our player of the match and yes it was UK Cal who had a
3:40:09
pretty solid series here on the gallion game two and then on best in game three yeah so the Aurora pick gets massive Al
3:40:16
value here I even feel like the Victor in game one the team fight that H they nearly won towards the start he got like
3:40:22
a thre man stun three man Al it felt like the Aurora is just dominating with the impact the old timing so good to
3:40:27
catch so many members waiting for summon as bur as well and the good in his game three this fight was obviously the big
3:40:34
cleanup but there's a clip I I have no doubt we're going to see in a second where he catches hand back with the edge of an all where that was just Flawless
3:40:40
like max range so really uh dominant performance here what's also cool is that it's very different play Styles
3:40:46
right we saw three very different champions from him a melee ad character then the Aurora which uh obviously
3:40:54
mostly plays out like an AP assassin and then the Victor and I know the Victor didn't necessarily look as convincing as
3:41:00
we uh we were mid voters which I think is the most obvious one I like the unle
3:41:06
shout out as well I think that ando's a player that at time has shown a lot so Jonah strong and wolf going for that one
3:41:12
as yeah I think as or was saying I know KDAY looks kind of bad but that was a game that they were getting absolutely
3:41:18
clobbered in I think this end score was like six or 17 18 and two yeah we have as well that's poetic
3:41:27
reached closer I love that one and just when defeat was near UK you know what that's by go go that was the actual
3:41:34
thing down at that bottom side of the map that fight over we got we got to step up our game these are these are
3:41:40
these lines are killers yeah wow okay well uh perfect piloting was I was thought
3:41:46
I guess Pon Pony's more in our line but Templar is is is getting poetic on us
3:41:52
yeah it's so cool that we get the thoughts you know I feel like sometimes always wondering about the uh the P
3:41:57
votes now we got to know the P votes not media though we don't get to know what's going on there yeah well uh again
3:42:03
congratulations DRX the first victory of the Season Bros we always have next game
3:42:08
next up we have the freaks showing off again DN freaks new Rebrand same boys
3:42:13
here against the noodle boys Nong shim red Force who will win we'll find out after the short break we'll see you in a
v
