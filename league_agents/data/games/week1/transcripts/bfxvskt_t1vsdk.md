15:59
R st crowns wall meet your down meet
17:03
we need to now talk about the lck rosters and this is uh this is the meet and potatoes this is what you came here for and this is what I have wanted to
17:10
talk about the entire time because wolf and I cast a kesper cup as we mentioned earlier on and I'm very happy to say
17:17
that bro are the winningest team heading into the lck and I think that they might be able
17:23
to go all the way this might be the year of the Bros go to playoffs yeah I agree uh let me just remind everyone and this
17:29
is starting at the very bottom of the list of teams that we've got here on our sheet but this is the roster it is
17:35
Morgan huk closer hype with bull there as well hype is of course on loan from
17:41
KT so still does belong to KT at this point in time and Paulo is still there as well so they kept the best players
17:47
from bro in the previous uh the previous year and they've added closer who I
17:53
think was The Shining Star of bnk Sorry bnk probably not going to look so good this year um and then added huk who is
18:00
the best jungler in Challenger by like a country mile like a giga country m a huge fan yeah yeah it was like him and
18:06
Lucid always went Toe to Toe and then the other apex predator left and it was like huk was just I guess I'll win
18:14
everything um and hype is amazing as well so this team and wolf and I saw it in kpup they are just really good yeah
18:21
even closer seems like a little bit um like he's been Unleashed he's beened and he still has his moments where like
18:28
sometimes his macro sense isn't as good as it needs to be but mechanically very strong and we have a very aggressive jungler like huk it kind of reminds me
18:34
of some of the best days of Croco but like a little bit more measured you know where he's just super aggressive all the time kind of like Lucid was in
18:40
Challengers um when he was at the top of his game it does unlock closer play style because a very aggressive player
18:45
wants to Skirmish wants to fight wants to use his mechanics in the the early mid game very well uh the team looked really good uh and hype is an incredible
18:52
Talent we've been watching him through Challengers for a really long time um I think KT kind of had a missed
18:58
opportunity not locking him into their normal roster with the player that he' been playing with for a really long time
19:03
yeah it's very strange but uh either way maybe they they made a great deal maybe bro paid a lot I don't know how that
19:09
deal went on it's not public obviously but um it it's a strong roster I do think that it has some limitations I
19:16
think that I don't want to get too hyped for them yet because in kespa cup also bro was a team that had a lot more to
19:23
win like had a lot more to prove it meant a lot more they also had their full roster I have to actually say the
19:28
caveat which is there's a few asterisks when it comes to the players let someone else do that not
19:35
your maybe someone in the YouTube comments can say well actually and you can have that just make sure you start
19:40
it with well actually if you can add italics that would make it even better um but yeah I think bro I think bro
19:46
actually like the team still looks good yeah no and I actually I'm I'm 100% with you and I'm known bro bro anti as as we
19:53
all know over the last couple of years no cuz cuz I never the only thing left is Morgan right and I guess Paulo as
19:59
well Paulo came in as a pretty positive he was a positive change I wasn't even a bro an in 2021 when they were actually a
20:07
pretty good team right and I think that they're going to make playoffs like this team I know the playoffs structure has
20:12
changed but like they could be top five very realistically which is so cool and
20:18
I think that these are exactly the type of signups that you want to see where like hug not being signed as you point
20:25
out makes sense cuz staying at KT like it's cuz that no one can really fault them for that but the fact that hype
20:30
gets to play for them yeah they'll be nerfed against KT which I think might actually be relevant cuz I think they
20:35
are contesting for fifth place yep with KT looking at the teams as they are now
20:41
cuz KT is uh same top side so perfect cause bdd perfect obviously had a bit of
20:46
a rough end to the year but we do know he's a grinder I do still think that giving him an opportunity is fine and
20:52
then dockum and wey and I was a really big fan of dockum but I feel like he's
20:57
kind of stagnating and then we super exting so maybe he can brief some new so good in Challengers that have to
21:06
see them together yeah there's an interesting thing to think about too with bro like bull obviously we we hyped him up a lot when he came into the scene
21:12
and then he kind of fell off he was playing well for like couple well but he he was the type of guy who he plays The
21:18
Lane bully wins Lane um but if you put him on a scaling 8 car you put him on Ezreal or something you're like oh you know this isn't great it's kind of
21:24
reminiscent obviously this is a much higher level thing to like what T1 was doing when they had Guma who's known to be like Lane Pusher Lane bully guy he's
21:31
also good at scaling but they had Teddy on the other side we like oh who are you going to play you got the the late game Fountain laser but you've also got the
21:36
lane bully kind of guy um hype is the late game type of guy not to say he can't aggressively win Lane um but when
21:43
they want to play something different it's cool that they have bull on their roster I don't think it's necessary that they'll only play him uh when they're
21:49
playing against KT we'll see what happens obviously because hype is a much better player or much more well-rounded but there are some situations where I
21:55
could see if bro wants to utilize Bull in this specific niche Ro where they could play him on on some uh specific
22:01
drafts they want to run especially in fearless and lck cup so I I just think this team is really fun it's really
22:06
flexible and uh it's it's finally a team making some big drastic changes but also
22:12
you know not breaking their budget either which is what we've seen a lot of teams try away from Recently on the east
22:17
side is just like I'll just put the challengers roster in and go ah we give up this year and I I really thought I
22:23
really thought bro was going to kind of phone it in this year especially with what we've sort of been hearing behind the scenes of them not exactly like
22:30
finding uh the most options as far as what they can do moving F further forward I think this is a phenomenal
22:36
outcome for a team that didn't have a whole lot of Hope and I just really hope that they can use the the Casper cup win
22:43
as sort of fuel to get them into good standing at the beginning of the year because I think like bro are so easy to
22:49
like like they could get to a point where this is the team that's like
22:55
joining that top five as far as teams that are able to like sell and you know create a big fan they could
23:00
be a TSM meme you know team type EXA and I think they already are but it's only going to get better and now
23:06
they're good if they're if they're good it it does really help cuz I the best part about the bro meme is that it it
23:12
molds into whatever it needs to be so it's not like they have to be bad for the memes to work no exactly all right
23:17
let's let's move on we've talked about bro um KT we spoke about a little bit I think um the doc Edition instead of just
23:24
calling up way I was really upset about sorry uh
23:29
um I think we were all upset about when it got announced it's still there kind of like it won't heal nobody's happy
23:35
about that yeah no I like I think dck is good I think he's a really nice guy I think hpe is a better
23:42
player do you guys remember Duck came in with a broken arm with a cast on and I'm
23:48
do you guys remember Ducks aelas do you guys do you guys remember how he did I'm really yeah no no I don't wolf no I
23:55
don't hey fbx had at that period where they were pretty good I mean it was mostly Milky Way but um it's a good
24:03
Challenger and joy year as well so we have and now it's stuck Dum way what instead of Milky Way oh god um cuz we
24:10
have sh also coming in we have diab who unfortunately unless he has a like Lev
24:17
so we only have a certain amount of time to talk about this we will be omitting being K from this discussion um can we
24:25
can sry um they just don't exist let's just not talk about it it'll make everyone Dia Diablo coming in is cool
24:32
okay that's a good player is it what Diablo is I'm not talking about the team he is good individually I mean I
24:40
mean I mean look yeah I'll say the words um he he he
24:46
was a really young player right he's just just become eligible to play in the lck uh we casted him what 2022 when we
24:52
were doing challenges back then uh a lot and he was definitely a rough round the edges type player but he definitely had
24:58
a lot of potential he had a prettyy decent Lucian that one game yeah his was Lucian was good um he's played some
25:04
decent vars games I I think he I think he will struggle I think he he's not like on the GU um like bull kind of like
25:12
oo this is a prospect right now level or even leaper you remember leaper yeah I remember he's not on this list but you
25:18
know there was like a little moment where like wow this guy's quite talented I think Diablo is going to struggle he's playing with Kellen who hasn't looked
25:23
great as of late and then the rest of that team he's not much of a leader of Lane as well it's diao's like for me
25:29
like a at best six out of 10 Prospect for Challengers I don't even say that in a mean way but I think he's not really going to shine on this roster so I don't
25:37
think people are going to be high on this guy after LC cup lck cup let's just say because the circumstances around it
25:43
are not great but if he can shine on this team somehow if he actually does break that barrier as an ad8 carry on
25:48
this roster I'm like well he's going he's going to places I'm hoping for a Teddy or gooes Arc I'm not expecting to
25:55
be able to and just to let you guys know the rest of the team is clear r vicka um back in again woohoo um and then diabl
26:02
and Kellen and and it's just kind of looking like 10th um so
26:07
let's I have a different team for 10 oh so who's the different team for 10 so there's a couple of options I guess DRX
26:13
yeah DRX DRX no but DRX is so interesting the geriatric team I'm so so
26:19
DRX do have a lot DRX actually has has has a lot of Legacy right we have we have the faker of that is a better way
26:26
to put it than the the faker of heart uh we have Jan Who's Back ated Again
26:31
world champion in what year what year was that wolf like how many years ago
26:36
was thatal years world champion Jan essential to their run in
26:43
2022 uh who is I assume going to play sub again hey UK the savior of uh 2018
26:49
KT yeah you UK who obviously was in uh TT for a good amount of time uh Teddy
26:56
Teddy who won like most hype play at the LC he did and also the most funny moments that he had as well like that
27:02
was actually super adorable and then onal not PL not pla I'm so glad that ax
27:08
is not here today because he would just get up and leave he was so angry when he
27:14
heard about that actually I think andil is actually pretty good though I thinky I also like I think it's going to be better for andil now that CV Max is in a
27:21
different country yes it will help I think that that'll be way can we not talk about where cvmax is with with who
27:27
cuz it it makes Meir very sad yeah um we don't need to talk about that uh thanks thanks thanks um it's really cool um
27:33
yeah I I I do think that and is a very skilled player I think he had a lot of off the rift issues as long as he can
27:39
get through those and Teddy's a great you know actually a great leader and a great player um I don't know how great
27:45
he is nowadays but who is the leader on this team maybe they can make it happen that's the problem I have this team
27:50
exactly right is it's sponge I think it's oh it's probably sponge give the re
27:56
to the young man well but like that's that's I feel like that was the role they tried to
28:02
fulfill is still a rookie in my mind but he's absolutely not like he's been around forever now seven years maybe UK
28:09
I mean it is the lck like everybody's a rookie in this league go so so
28:15
DRX yeah so DRX and BFK I think we can safely or bfx I think we can all safely
28:21
say our expectations are tempered relatively low um and what about did not
28:27
finish um we're starting really at the bom I don't
28:34
know there's a lot of the here I was thinking so positively when I saw some of these rosters like you know you have
28:40
Berserker coming back right yosik's on DMF and D is pretty good life was always
28:45
solid you know and you know Teddy and youal and Rich I'm like well there some there's a mixture of like experience
28:50
players um H is on Nim with kingan okay that could be okay like G he was but the
28:56
more I think about it it's like you have all these an and and these players that haven't really been they've been given
29:01
enough time to shine and haven't I feel like it's going to be after the game like old veterans drink of the ball so
29:06
you be like H we've been losing for four years to lose just like
29:13
us yeah I just I think the problem with with uh dnf specifically is that there's
29:18
just a lot of players on that team that have a big variance in form and I think
29:25
I think that's what makes that team fun for me I I feel like there's there's a lot of like there's teams and DRX and
29:32
dnf are like exactly the examples of this of like if it comes together you
29:37
can see it being awesome yes oh yeah you can I can see how the team would work I have it in my brain like how it's
29:43
supposed to work um the reason I put bfx at the very bottom was that you can't
29:48
see I can't see it I just I just there's no angle for me in my after via's recent
29:54
by the way is the new official Tri code actually bfx or is it bnk it's bfx and I'm really glad that it Fox so we don't
30:00
need to worry about the fox thing again they figured it out yeah they did they made a tri code that exist amazing cuz
30:06
cuz in theory like this is also dnf is a team that's also likely to play really weird stuff between like jarvin support
30:14
and then bulldog with having a champion ocean Pik existing Dudu being the first
30:19
to ever rapid star coming back to coaching as well and so like that for me is like really fun but as with uh as
30:27
with Nong I think actually Nim I could also see be good if everything if kingan plays the way that he did not last year
30:34
or actually if they find I I think if last year he was good right like that was when he was just very stable No
30:41
Nonsense even in summer like during the season I think kingan started to ramp up last year K fell off a cliff their
30:48
world's performance was probably some of the roughest performances of their
30:53
careers so like that's I think what makes that cuz Sylvie Fisher gu I think the parts that you'd want to keep of the
30:59
N shame roster like that makes sense to me I mean Fisher he like plays nefy on purpose it's so cool I mean fer one out
31:07
of five games I'm like could be a top three mid laner four out of five games I'm like definitely a bottom
31:13
two yeah and and I I think if he can hone that one out of five games in most of his games and not just be drafted
31:20
Corky every game which he won't because the metal change obviously and it has changed quite a lot since he was playing surely it won't be a Zero versus Corky
31:26
this year right no surely not um I think this team could find its footing and I
31:32
actually think Gideon could be you know depending on the syvia underperforms Gideon has had his moments as well and
31:37
because Gideon's on a team now where he has to kind of earn his spot if he's doing well in scrims and Sylvia is just kind of flatlining because he often does
31:45
maybe Gideon gets a shot um because I actually think Gideon's ceiling is higher than sylv's personally there
31:50
could be something here um for this Nim roster but it it feels like between Nim
31:56
and dnf I'm worried there's going to be like too much cooking you know earlier I was talking about oh I hope the rise group you know they cook a little bit
32:02
they try some like these ones maybe you know just get out the the frozen food and uh I I think you don't need that
32:09
special apartment you just like just a microwave is fine actually let's just like keep it simple with bfx and DRX I
32:15
don't see it with dnf and Nim I don't think it'll happen but you can like kingan and lens are good like L
32:22
especially if if you look at their ceilings like holy like that's it would be amazing the that we've seen the floor
32:29
yeah for for kingan I I I think that uh on average his career is a lot like L I
32:34
think had just a bad worlds but outside of that was the best support for like three quarters of the year and has been
32:40
top tier in the lck for the last what like three years now come on give the light some credit yeah the light was
32:47
only the light was better means that he was up there you know I thought he said best support so I was like I mean l
32:53
Lance did win them in MSI true right like I think I think uh actually in
32:59
Spring he was a bit sussy that's fair him and Pace both were not amazing back then but basically carer sorry nor nor
33:07
was ker really yeah no uh but suffice it to say it could work will it I I
33:14
unfortunately don't think so so then we have KT and bro fighting for fifth SL
33:20
six right like those two most likely that's what we're expecting the bottom four or the bottom four we'll see what order they're in now let's talk about
33:26
some drama baby no feel that agency I want I want to
33:33
save that for L cuz that's that's what everyone is waiting for I want to talk about DK and jeni first so that we have
33:40
and then we can just end on end on the Banger cuz DK I think will be exactly
33:45
the same team that they were last year God I love this team yeah this is my favorite te I don't think they're going
33:51
to be good I think sh is absolutely amazing though this player is so fun my
33:57
God if ilma actually got promoted to the lck when he was good yeah when he was yeah and I and like aiming in Barrel in
34:03
the butt Lane just sounds like a sitcom and I'm so into that I'm So Into I think that they will be a solid fourth that
34:10
are going to have absolutely incredible games and then the next time you're watching and you're like my what what
34:17
are they doing no I feel like there's this is a team that like gets gets third place the first few weeks and you're like wow and then like right when it's a
34:23
time we're getting close to the split between Ry and Legend they drop into the rise group and everyone's like oh what's
34:29
happening like they're like we're going to take the rise way out and a bunch of people who are watching and don't like D+ are like I always knew they were bad
34:36
I knew all I didn't believe them oh God like just like it is every year with de I think the fraud alert is just going to
34:42
be like a hot monitor the whole time it's even worse cuz now they have Barrel yeah exactly it's so perfect and then
34:49
they're going to win WS show You're motivated you know won all the narrative
34:54
is going to have to come he burnt out and you know yeah I'm going to I'm going to love this team and I already know they're going to break my heart so many
35:01
times cuz this is like my current right my current favorite jungling Prospect and then showmaker and Shu finally
35:08
coming in which I think is something that we were hoping for and if you guys uh didn't catch KAS cup Shu was amazing
35:15
in the Kasper cup he was so Maniac he is he's what you won in a young top laner
35:20
uh I think which we saw with like Z's debut as well right where like from the beginning it was just going ham love
35:26
that team I feel like DK small side note DK and bro I feel like are the teams are
35:32
that are best at watching Challengers and like getting the good players you know because they're actually utilizing
35:37
that new talent that we have a great system for here in Korea and not just paying some other random veteran like oh
35:43
please save our team like please come in wased by D it's insane because they
35:50
fitas obviously gone to C9 and fitas was a really high Prospect and then within
35:56
like because of their Academy team being as good as it is within like a year and a half two years they have a new
36:02
Prospect that's good enough to play in the LC and they have Khan as positional coach as well I think like it's it's
36:07
crazy and Khan is exactly what this guy needs because Khan was him when he was beginning his career developed into like
36:15
is also as wolf is saying I don't think they'd ever drop below fifth but they are going to do some they might I could
36:22
see them at I really could I really I I think the the floor is too high with aiming showmaker Lucid but I do think
36:30
that the floor is never too high for Barrel yeah was it's interesting that Brendan mentioned the the like oh like
36:37
actually utilizing Challengers Talent everyone always thought Noam was CU they're like oh they're using the whole Challenger seene that's that's not
36:42
utilizing well then they also prove they really don't know cuz they just did what you said
36:48
in utilizing talent scouts is I think what uh what he was talking about all right so let's talk about geni real
36:54
quick because we're running out of time and I think this roster is a slight downgrade I actually don't really I'm
37:00
not ready to trust ruler fully but I'm not worried about him as much I am about Duro I think Duro is good braah is
37:07
insane um but I think this roster is going to take some time and I've said that about jengi before where I'm like
37:13
oh it's a new roster it's got some strong players but it'll take some time for them to figure it out then they they didn't need any time I wonder how ruler
37:21
and duro going to get along because ruler has played with some really really strong support players over the years he's obious loved that this is exactly
37:28
what rer needs and I think that like I'm so glad that you bring this up because this whole bottom Lane situation is
37:34
where all the confusion is coming from right it's like why why Duro it doesn't make sense ruler needs a blank slate
37:41
that's the only player that he yeah yeah he needs not hands he's like no get your
37:46
opinions out of here this is my Lane you do what you're told and like that is precisely the player that ruler is and
37:53
duro is pretty good at knowing when to pull the trigger like this guy has been like a great engaged support like so far
38:00
and in the past better execute is what they need when they've got so much veteran Talent
38:05
on this team yeah it was him and Raptor that kind of if you remember there was like a kind of an up search for bnk lost
38:11
split yeah that was because dur came me I am with wolf I think that while the roster in summer I'm like this is 100%
38:19
And they're always they're always with the tops side they're always going to be contesting for for first right yeah but it's compared to last year I Am with You
38:26
Duro to me is like Delight but slightly less like I was really hyped about Delight when he
38:32
came in even though he wasn't Brian for what he showed I think what D showed on bnk last year wasn't quite as good but
38:38
what he showed in Challengers comparatively was as good as being a top tier support in nek so it's kind of I'm
38:44
not really sure where he'll land uh but I don't know with that top side like who cares and also be f rer as as good as I
38:52
think PA was ruler is in my opinion still an upgrade just because of how Dependable he is as player is one of the
38:57
greatest 8 cars of all time so it's like yeah the um so I think the chef's in the kitchen like conversation could be had
39:04
right because you've got Kan chovy ruler now who all want Mone was the anti- ego okay like he didn't have any he didn't
39:10
he wasn't demanding a lot of resources and now St well I'm saying rer is ruler is like is I would I would say like of
39:19
all the players we have in the lck like ruler is probably top three ego right in terms of like his personality like he's
39:24
he's very bold person right and I don't know how this is all going to gel together if he and duro aren't getting
39:30
along and like there's some problems early this roster could really take some time to get very charismatic uh person
39:37
and a great interviewer so I do Wonder but like yeah I see what you mean yeah and he was he came say I'm going to be
39:43
the next carrier like that was that's not actually good I I also think I I we
39:50
we'll have to see I do think that the years in the LPL and the 2023 loss to T1
39:55
I think has kind of from what I've seen at least ruler has kind of chilled a little bit in terms of uh yeah I think
40:02
that it was last year especially would have been a bit of a cown for no of course and compared to U where he was in
40:09
2022 right when he uh was able to finally win um I think this team will
40:15
again like anything below F would be a complete shock yeah all right let's get
40:21
into the drama for the first time ever in like LC
40:27
history T1 didn't get what they wanted yeah in terms of the off season it is like the first time this has ever happened and unless I'm misremembering
40:34
or something is deleted from my brain it's the first time ever T1 got outdone by another or another or had a better
40:41
offer they couldn't get they couldn't get Zas they just couldn't get him and like there's been a lot of drama there's
40:46
been a lot of discussion about this like oh like the agents messed up if Z wanted to be on T1 and if T1 wanted to get him
40:53
they could have made it happen he either didn't want to join T1 or or T1 just couldn't afford him because of the
40:59
luxury tax the salary cap the what is it the financial regulations or whatever it's officially called and we're also
41:05
we're not going to we're going to try not to speculate too much you guys can watch your favorite perspective of
41:10
content creator and go and take their opinion about what happened just go for it it's totally fine yeah make it your
41:16
own there are no facts that we can truly lay down on the line outside of the fact
41:21
that Zas is on hle now Atlas but what if we're their favorite content creator
41:26
well that's why they're watching and I would recommend you watch
41:32
omitted so this no I'm I'm with you this is insane and I think it's a huge change
41:37
for how T1 is going to have to play as a team because Zas was the you can blind him anything or you can counter pick him
41:44
in a meta where that's where that actually works and they played around that in draft so much so that you know
41:50
gumaa could either push aggressively have all those resources Faker can roam him down they set up those Dives and they put Z on that counter pick where
41:56
he's safe on the top side or vice versa try to play around Z in the top side he's one of the best strong side players
42:01
in the league if not the best over the last few years it's been pretty obvious he's been one of the most consistent top laners Doran is like the opposite of
42:08
that he's a he's so good into Zas because he so good at being that weak side into an aggressive player but he
42:14
himself when he tries to be aggressive it's very Hit or Miss I think having that lack of consistency is really going
42:20
to hurt how this T1 roster plays overall because it's just they've been together
42:25
so long right and they've they had this very predictable but still very difficult to defeat play style for a really long time Dorne completely
42:31
changes that and I don't know how how it's gonna work for me I'm most worried for them at Worlds because T1 were
42:37
always you know a little bit Hit or Miss especially last year two summ in a row
42:42
uh yeah for Summers and for regular seasons and then when it comes to Worlds time all five players they click on and
42:50
Z's picks up uh you know world's MVP and stuff like that Doran can't be that guy
42:56
he's been the ex exact opposite of that guy he's been he's going to help with their stability in in like the end of
43:02
the season he's going to be in Lane when they play against HS what does that mean for T1 now it's like they're going to be
43:08
okay A bit better here in the summer season but maybe they don't win Worlds now you know like I don't know if they
43:14
can do it with Doran I'm actually really concerned for them because they've always been able to turn it on but I don't think Doran how he doesn't have
43:21
thatt there's a big difference there's a big difference for me and I think a lot of there are a lot of our team teams
43:27
that have the right mix of players that can help a winning game be one and there
43:33
are players that turn games into a winning game and I think that jengi bringing in ruler is an example of
43:39
having another player that can make a winning game or yeah where game where you're losing turn around yeah I think
43:45
paays was a role player I think that when you're winning paay is a phenomenal player to have on your team because he's
43:51
really good at like he screws that that that screw in like he's really really good at that rer makes moments that win
43:58
you games Zas also makes moments that win you games Doran makes moments that
44:03
lose you games or he facilitates a beautiful team fight and we've had so
44:09
many of these moments right where like they're both Gras players it's kind of interesting to talk about like I feel like Zas is the kind of guy that will
44:15
kill you in a sid Lane as gragas and Doran is the kind of guy that will just obliterate a team f team fight for you
44:21
on gr or he'll or he'll like sit on gragas and like kill two people on a dive uh in like abbing pressure but he's
44:29
not the one that will like I'm just going oh so we're losing this game oh I guess I'll just y the backline and we're
44:35
just going to win like Zas is that guy and I think that T1 relied on having that guy that was able to turn turn
44:41
around these game States from the top side otherwise they don't have as much
44:46
oomph in creating these moments and you can't have just one you can't have just Faker that's there to try and turn a
44:52
game around you you you have to have a Perma ban of yon against H life Esports now because you have Zea and zos on the
44:58
same team um they can the fact that they can Flex it is absurd yeah what you were
45:03
saying about um players that can make games one I feel like H life is filled
45:08
with five players that can do that now right peanut he always does that zeka
45:14
has done that many a Time Zea a little bit more of like maybe he has that one moment in the team fight that you were talking about but Viper and Delight as
45:20
well like big engages or huge team fights from Viper I feel like H life Esports are number one team now in the L
45:28
the because they kept the defending championship team with with one huge upgrade and they upgraded their weakest
45:35
part like massively and got one of the strongest parts of one peut together like how do you live well yeah in that
45:41
top side how do you live I've been a I've been a super big fan of Z ever since they de which I found out last world it's actually the same they I
45:48
debuted which is really cute a um that's amazing so right I wasun
45:55
yeah uh um I meant it I meant it for no but I think it's from from his
46:02
perspective as well the only way that he ever cuz he has been in contention it's
46:07
basically been him and Bin for best top laner in the world for the last what like four years since say 2021 2022
46:13
right Ben started a little bit earlier say Obviously uh wasn't the starter until 2022 but it's been the two of them
46:20
fighting forward first couple of years it was more bin favored I think recently B I think didn't have as good a worlds as he did domestically so more recent
46:27
it's been Za's favorite but the fact that that fight has been going on the
46:32
only way for Z to truly prove that you are the best player is by leaving T1 because as we can see from how owner is
46:38
rated which I think we're finally coming around a little bit on you will never be rided as a truly best player in the
46:45
world until you do it without Faker so like from that perspective as well I think it makes sense for a player to
46:50
want to he's also been like he's been having this conversation quite a few times right like he's often said that
46:57
like I just want to be on the best team I don't he he was never the one that was like I want to keep the brothers
47:03
together yeah I mean it's like rer when he left gen where it's like I want to do this on my own now I want to try something else you know I mean he came
47:09
back ultimately and who knows maybe rejoin also joining an insane roster too
47:14
so even if he gets it done with this team I'm like yeah to me it sounds proves the situation is almost a mirror
47:21
of almost identical sorry to rer going to jdg like trying to make that team that is definitely going to win I feel
47:27
like this roster almost Rivals to me the Keen Canyon chovi um PA La Hens roster
47:33
in terms of like best roster ever like in the time I think this might actually even be a stronger roster because paay
47:40
was still somewhat unproven like he had won titles and has always been a little bit like you don't know Z I feel like
47:46
has proven himself to not be the random like chance guy now like I feel like he's consistent now I feel like we can
47:51
Rel extremely Rel but that's the thing right like looking at this roster I think mid is the only place
47:59
where you can make an argument that you could theoretically slau well that's my point but like you
48:04
could argue that having chovi for most of the year and then Faker for world that's the like even those are arguable
48:10
right because I agree with you I think Z has been absolute top tier player I think his worlds was actually not as
48:16
good as as I'd hoped um but like the fact that that is your worst player with
48:22
how he's been playing recently that's GG yeah CU like Canyon
48:28
feels like it's yeah kind of a s gr situation right think we're out of time
48:33
there's so much more we can talk about we got a whole season of lck and lck
48:53
cup you say You're Not Afraid to
49:02
die take the around your
49:08
chest watch left inside I li Li your do you believe if it
49:20
washes take right rough as you can tell
49:25
you see secet right as your
49:33
are I like through
51:25
yeah fix it hi do
51:38
hi
51:45
King hello and welcome to the 2025 lck
51:50
cup we are back here on day number two I'm Valdez with me is chronicler today
51:55
and we're just so happy to get back into the action we had our season opener last week we had that cool event now we had
52:02
the first day yesterday we already saw that runis aacon doesn't exist he won't exist today uh and he won't exist in the
52:09
future either but uh yeah very excited to get back into the action here at the lck cup we have not costed it together
52:17
in a fair long time and normally we make up for that time by playing video games you had to go and you know have a kid so
52:23
when was the last time yeah sorry about that I don't have to apologize to me it's fine I understand uh no it it would
52:30
have been uh yeah summer season somewhere may I don't remember if it was finals or for somewhere in the playoffs
52:36
maybe Regional qualifiers maybe like early September yeah that's a long time
52:41
Brandon but we are reunited and we're got to have a good day we are and uh if you guys I I saw a lot of confused
52:48
Chatters yesterday they're like what is lck cup well it's a shorter version of a
52:54
season and it's it's got a new kind of format here we've got group baren and group Elder going head-to-head your
53:01
group needs to perform well in order to have all of your teams Mak it into playoffs the last team of the losing
53:08
group will actually be straight up knocked out and they won't have a chance to play in the playoff stages at all um
53:14
you do see that we have some of the results here already the DM freaks were able to take the victory yesterday over
53:21
Nim and the Bros unfortunately did fall to DRX there who did take the win only
53:27
one correct prediction from our Squad was uh Deon for the DM freaks yeah Korean side was a lot more on the money
53:34
on that one uh they had a lot more faith and maybe they weren't quite as bought in into the bro and cast back up hype as
53:40
we take a look at bnk fairx vicka is back diabo is called up and Kellen now
53:47
making his way onto this roster CL Raptor sticking around from last split
53:53
but via coming back actually made some waves during his performance uh in the
53:59
season opening but that was a for fun tournament and uh C back up wasn't and we saw that even kup didn't really give
54:05
us any valuable information so he really beat up on Mid Viper you know he did he looks great yeah yeah that did happen
54:12
yeah um we also do have KT rster with some changes we've got cuz he is back
54:18
here with KT he's there with bdd uh the power Duo there once again also duck
54:25
returning here as well and way getting called up unfortunately without his buddy hype but we'll have a great ad8
54:31
carry to play alongside of IND duom very curious to see how that bot Lane is going to look today still happy to see
54:38
Way come back also do note score as head coach something that I think for a lot of KT fans is going to feel right and
54:46
we'll see to what extent KT can make the dreams happen this time around it's going to be a lot of fun to watch but
54:52
guys we do have an interview let's check in on that right now
55:25
for for
56:15
K it's always so fun to see the new players coming into the lck it feels so
56:20
cute to see them like oh I'm so excited my first game and you know especially for you chronicler a huge Challenger
56:27
enjoyer uh the biggest one actually out of all of us we can't take that title away from you you must be really excited
56:34
to see these two players playing today you know I am uh Diablo I I just did some research so here are a couple of
56:41
movies that are older than di the movie Cars uh Mission possible free Happy Feet
56:48
Happy Feet I know he's younger than all of those I mean I was 16 in 2007 so uh
56:56
yeah anyway um we got our new cool walk out here for the lck cup the two teams
57:02
come out together and they're going to fist bump unless you're a Berserker yesterday who forgot about it um but it
57:10
was really funny and uh yeah I really like the the new walk out actually I think it adds a little bit of uh a
57:16
little bit of spice you know especially once we get past like the you know the basic one and people start to do more
57:22
interesting stuff um that'll be a lot of fun but let's see what bfx have prepared
57:28
today looks like uh they should hold those letters up cuz if there's one thing that we learn every time we watch
57:34
who are you man these players are funny they just need to show it the kind of extravagant stuff they got up on as uh
57:41
there we go with a bit more enthusiasm than the
57:46
rest yeah maybe they were waiting for some kind of queue they didn't realize they were on camera but either way this
57:51
is a very interesting roster I think that Viet does bring a bit of hype with his performance in the season an opening
57:56
event but at the same time I I feel like there's not really a a main shot caller
58:02
I'm very curious to see how it's going to function as a fiveman unit whereas here on the side of KT you've got a lot
58:08
of guys I think that can call uh for it especially BB and cuz will have to be the core I would say you know the two
58:14
veterans the main veterans that have played together before a lot and um obviously have a ton of experience even
58:20
duck Dom's been around for a while now to help out you know perfect in his second season and way coming up here and
58:27
uh just helping them get through some of those nerves and come together as a team yeah both doam and ruler coming back
58:34
from the LPL this split definitely some high quality ad carry talent that makes
58:40
his way back into but we did have to give up pace but unfortunately yeah unfortunately there's always you know
58:46
the uh collateral damage the the sacrifice you know somebody's got to go
58:51
and perfect as we remember last spring had a break performance I think he did
58:57
struggle towards the end of the year even though there was a lot of reports of how incredibly dedicated he was I
59:03
don't think was able to quite hold up that level cuz might actually have been able to sneak away Rookie of the Year
59:10
from Lucid had that been the case cuz at the beginning of the year definitely was favored towards him yeah and we'll see
59:16
CU being back on KT the last time this man was on the team yes it ended in heartbreak but the way there was
59:23
glorious and there really isn't anything more KT than that yeah I mean uh as you
59:29
mentioned before as well score uh being the coach uh now for KT it just kind of
59:34
all makes sense you know there's a lot of things that made sense for KT during the off season they kind of just went um
59:40
the only thing that maybe would have made more sense is bringing up hype as well but he also took a loss yesterday
59:46
and you know duck Dom is more of a veteran so maybe they don't want too many rookies in the lineup I mean you
59:51
think about perfect and hype and way uh relatively new players maybe they didn't want to quite stack it that much so you
59:58
can see a little bit of strategy as well and what they wanted to go for they also didn't want to give the consistency they had with last year Spot Lane right death
1:00:06
and Barrel yeah and the we're going to be looking
1:00:11
towards him today expectation is that bnk is definitely the underdog here as mentioned I think particular one two of
1:00:18
bdd and cuz has already shown how insanely strong they are cuz even though
1:00:23
uh as they often do quangong back then now DN freaks was unable to actually
1:00:28
make it that was not because of him he had so many incredible performances throughout the year and Kellen also
1:00:35
ended on a bit of a downswing as we saw last year got replaced by moam somewhere
1:00:40
towards the end of summer didn't end up playing at Worlds which might have benefited him cuz moam did and didn't
1:00:46
leave a very good impression we'll see how he's able to stand up here to wey today because we is
1:00:52
one of the more hyped Prospect I think it was really uh hanok hype and way that
1:00:58
built the initial hype for KT and then one Zin again and that roster really clicked but he's still absolutely
1:01:04
dunking on people got a quick two Z at the beginning of this week with KT as well as an Applause for score
1:01:10
unsurprisingly yeah uh a huge one everybody pretty much and showing some old pictures of him and Ru as well as
1:01:21
um what is that on the left I I don't no
1:01:26
so I thought it I thought it was Hoka for who from Hunter Hunter but I
1:01:31
don't well I don't actually think that was it I just saw the the clown get up but I think it's slightly different so I
1:01:37
don't know about this well we'll leave it to your imagination um I was very excited to see the score and Ru picture
1:01:44
because they're coaching against each other today and now we're going to get into our first round and if you're new
1:01:50
here for the 2025 lck cup and actually around the world we're going Fearless so
1:01:55
so if you pick something you can't play it again for the rest of the series those are the
1:02:01
rules and uh already it has led to some really interesting picks uh in you know
1:02:08
game 3es we had two of those yesterday you were here the entire day I was at home relaxing watching you guys having a
1:02:14
great time watching The League of Legends yeah what you're saying is you didn't get as much of a visceral experience ASAS and again to remind
1:02:22
everyone either team plays a champ it is out the bands don't matter although the
1:02:28
bands often stay kind of the same but a champion is picked by either team and it will no longer be available it'll appear
1:02:34
at the top of your screen when we get to the next round of drafts and we have already seen in the one day that some
1:02:41
teams are a lot better equipped at dealing with this than others because it really changes draft and how you can
1:02:47
Target out specific roles how you need to have a deeper Champion poll and how you need to be a lot more flexible with
1:02:53
both your priority but also with how you build out your compositions uh and thus
1:02:59
far some teams have not really been able to do that we'll see if today is any different yeah I mean in that aspect you
1:03:05
really have to give KT the advantage um you know I I I just think especially in
1:03:10
the mid jungle roles like bdd and cuz they can play like 10 plus different
1:03:16
Champions to maybe their best level right so that's um you know we all know
1:03:21
about BD zir and stuff like that from from older days but he can play so many different things and I think that's
1:03:26
really going to benefit them in that mid jungle Duo as Rumble is the first pick here you don't see the scarner scarner
1:03:33
is really the big one that we see a lot first pick but they ban it on blue side Ash Sani would make a lot of sense here
1:03:39
can even pick up the Braum later on and have both incredible engage the CC that it provides is crazy Sani here and then
1:03:48
yon would I think make the most sense but they might feel like Raptor isn't going to prioritize it cuz obviously is an incredible Sani but he is also pretty
1:03:56
flexible can still go towards some of the more Niche picks we saw the N yesterday I don't think that was a great
1:04:01
spot because is one of the guys that gets to play that champion without us having any doubts and the setup for
1:04:09
being K though clear getting one of his Comer Champions the rumble was the champion that I think he kind of started turning around his general public
1:04:16
opinion on he did have a bit of a slow start last year but ended quite strong
1:04:21
and it was a couple of Rumble performances that I think really cemented that Cor going to get picked up here for Via and I would expect a jungle
1:04:31
pickup as well although the maai is of course a flex could theoretically still go towards Kellen but most likely will
1:04:38
be for Raptor here and providing a ton of lockdown has really dropped in priority I think there was a lot of
1:04:44
games yesterday where we just fell through the draft Yeah uh as you mentioned you know a lot of uh a lot of
1:04:50
uh Flex potential actually um even the corki the Corky as well C8 carry already
1:04:57
and uh even the rumble although we're probably not going to see that Flex thinking about a Zyra here is cuz and
1:05:04
that is going to get locked in so not quite the Sani were expecting but it is
1:05:10
an AP jungler to go along with the O name theoretically could even also be
1:05:15
flexed uh I think ashar does not sound like a good time to play into yeah I don't think it's likely we did actually
1:05:22
see I think one or two zy bents yesterday as well is still a jungler that's very strong in
1:05:28
the same way as there was before incredibly quick cleer can chew for the jungle at a rapid pace and into tank
1:05:33
jungles in particular you get a lot more leeway though not at high of a risk of
1:05:39
getting invaded early on of getting jumped and caught in early skirmishes and the game is very team fight Centric
1:05:45
at the moment if you didn't catch yesterday if you're just watching your favorite teams there are a lot of 5v5 it
1:05:50
feels like the smaller skirmishes have kind of Gone by the wayside and instead that first grub spawn we've had multiple
1:05:56
55s there it's just everything kind of matters a bit more you know uh even a single objective uh a single Aon which
1:06:05
is a huge objective obviously fighting over that you got to group around that just a lot of things to group around so
1:06:11
um I feel like it kind of was the changes that Riot wanted to see and we are seeing that so far the Ezreal also
1:06:17
banned away so really giving credit for the corki in the mid lane and just trying to pick away stuff from diao here
1:06:26
the one downside of the Zyra is that Zyra is a champion that really likes to be played into because she's very
1:06:32
immobile it's really good lockdown lot of AOE damage and these Le old but not really that great when she has to be the
1:06:38
one initiating things and Thea is kind of contrary to that obviously going to be playing a lot more forward more
1:06:45
circles here could be good for KT we saw the Gallo come out yesterday this is a
1:06:51
lot of comfort I also think that it would be good with the Zyra specifically
1:06:57
but I also feel like the Renekton hasn't really felt that strong even though in theory I think it makes sense because
1:07:03
the early fights are really big yeah having a strong presence is definitely a
1:07:09
big bonus this is one of the AR's uh favorites but trying to play kaisa when
1:07:14
there is a lot of AOE damage I think can always feel a little bit ify do got to
1:07:19
say though the bnk draft as a as a as a whole makes a lot of sense a lot of damage a lot of AOE team fighting Power
1:07:26
and yeah we talked about the Bron before I think would make a ton of sense really really strong when you have things like
1:07:33
the kaisa diving into you yeah I mean you're going to be dealing with the kaisa the Leona even
1:07:39
some maybe Les I say it the engage maai um could be happening so the Brum just
1:07:46
feels very comfortable I I think that's a great one to kind of sit around your Ash and uh just feel very nice uh the
1:07:52
Renekton to come out here into the rumble is going to be an interesting matchup we saw that Jace banned away in
1:07:58
the first round of bands on the red side and uh you know with the rumble coming out he just decided to go for that reaon
1:08:05
so definitely curious to see how that one is going to go and Via he looked great on yon in the season opener bdd
1:08:11
steals that one away from him and now via's got to play into it as corki how is that matchup going to look
1:08:17
how is via going to look uh on the real stage this also the question of the bot
1:08:23
Lane because the kaisa I think is in a great spot at the moment but an ash bro Lane that is rough we might actually see
1:08:30
bfx go for a lane swap to try and get out of that 2v2 because that is I think where they are the weakest uh Renekton
1:08:37
into Rumble is just very volatile can go either way depending on how the jungle uh matchup plays out who gets a lead
1:08:43
there first so a lot of questions going into this first game and again these teams
1:08:49
are not only fighting for their own score they're also benefiting their group you get a win for your group it
1:08:55
makes the whole LC cup a whole a lot less stressful yeah I mean you want to win or
1:09:03
yourself for your group for everything basically um as you see part of group
1:09:10
Baron is bfx and they are going to be going up against the team that is in
1:09:15
group Elder on the opposite side of the rift it is of course KT rollster and bdd
1:09:21
on the definitely a fun way to start I'm excited for this one chronicler as it looks like we are ready to hop onto the
1:09:27
rift game number one of bfx versus KY rolster starts
1:09:46
now and here we go I feel like we're on the KT side of the arena chronicler with
1:09:53
the gigantic cheer we just had everybody very excited for this KT
1:10:02
roster have early War being placed and that does confirm what I was expecting
1:10:07
KT really wants the 2v2 do know I do see Diablo and Ken here
1:10:13
because again Ash and Braum Ash alone is already an insanely oppressive Lane but
1:10:18
playing with Braum into two short-range characters and an engage support is really going to make life very very
1:10:24
tough and they are now waiting here in mid
1:10:29
don't have confirmation but they did see CLA actually move away from that Ward and I don't think that the ward there
1:10:35
was spotted and here you see indeed doom and we are able to match the swap really
1:10:41
pretty big win for them something that they're going to be very very happy about we'll see what the response of bfx
1:10:46
is going to be yeah it's h it's 2025 and Lane swaps still a thing we saw a bunch
1:10:54
of them yesterday uh I'm not sure exactly how many maybe like four out of
1:11:00
the six um but it's it's a it's definitely still a thing and it's here to stay and
1:11:07
especially because uh the early grubs are such a fought over objective it does feel like a lot of teams are trying to
1:11:14
get up there as well and uh still you know avoid certain matchups as you've been mentioning in this game
1:11:20
specifically uh maybe even put on a little bit of extra pressure with some of those resistances taken away from
1:11:26
some of those mid and top towers and stuff like that so not surprised to see Lane swaps here still with us also
1:11:33
already seeing what we talked about before even after the Nerfs something that the Zyra is also always going to
1:11:40
excel at is just power clearing Through the Jungle about I say 5 6 seconds ahead
1:11:46
of raptor we'll see if he actually able to turn it into anything cuz clear is getting relatively low but turrets if you haven't caught any games turrets are
1:11:53
a lot scarier than they used to be which I think is is quite cool I think we
1:11:58
gotten a lot better at Dives over the years and felt like turs didn't really pose much of a threat even in the lck
1:12:05
like obviously you're going to see it in soloy but even in lck we've seen teams misjudge a little bit how much damage
1:12:11
they can take it's perfect yeah he is setting up for something here but it doesn't look like KZ is going to be the
1:12:16
position instead looking to Mid but not 100% certain because he he also should
1:12:22
know that raptor is on the bottom half of the map well get spotted and looks like nothing is going to come of
1:12:28
it B missing the cannon there he is under a bit of pressure here B doing a good job as cuz has Smite but he has not
1:12:36
spotted Raptor I don't believe couple of pings in mid though so kind of have a decent idea there was maybe still a
1:12:42
plant left up in the bush uh yeah I think cuz used the scryer so he saw that
1:12:47
Raptor was on his butt side Raptor knows that with milb pryo he wouldn't be able to uh contest so so always going to go
1:12:54
for the top we'll see if he's willing to try and sneak away the Raptors here could actually is actually a fine win
1:13:00
though but instead is just going to secure a little bit of vision here yeah as we see uh the new teleports everybody
1:13:08
just flying across the map it's so funny
1:13:14
Woo you're having a great time we haven't seen I kind of expected Jon strong at some point to do a yeah
1:13:21
dramatic pan I'm sure he will he's just waiting for the right moment why not why not does H Sports have a new
1:13:28
motto I assume they all do uh yeah we should CU we have some new mots here in the L actually cuz they are great for
1:13:35
the two teams that are playing right now let me uh let me grab them take a take a moment to uh to look at those as we do
1:13:43
have cuz he is spotted up on the top side of the map and uh I mean with the
1:13:48
amount of pressure they have in the fact that they're pushing it's it's not really uh that bad of a spot although
1:13:53
it's actually pushing away from bfx at the moment and CU he been able to come in just he knows he's spotted just
1:13:59
trying to help out a little bit push them off uh that's Lane so have you
1:14:05
found the mados I have so for bfx it is dream new
1:14:12
ambition but we already have old ambition he's a streamer now yeah so why
1:14:18
do we need new ambition well I I don't have the answers to that vas I'm just saying that's they're just dreaming of it it's it's evocative I'll say that
1:14:26
okay you know it gets you thinking it does I don't know mostly about what it
1:14:31
means but it's always good to try to you know try to figure it out um so what's the
1:14:37
other one so the one for KT is is I think also very at which just time to prove ourselves what they're trying to
1:14:44
prove is obviously left unset but I think they're just trying to prove their still KT which the best way to do that
1:14:49
would be to lose hair and then beat Han they're trying to prove that they're
1:14:55
the exact same team they've always been perfect he's uh he's got a bit of damage but he's not going to get a kill Kellin
1:15:02
bit of trouble has to flash if that knockup hits from bdd he was in danger of actually being taken down for First
1:15:08
Blood and First Blood definitely still very important we saw yesterday that still you know even Atlas was talking
1:15:14
about this on this C on the cast it feels like you know if you can get objectives and kind of roll them into a first turret that feels like a you know
1:15:21
a couple of wins you can get in a row uh whereas first BL kind of stands alone you see that KT has grouped up for the
1:15:28
grubs where's bfx this is the objective that you fight over but instead they
1:15:34
just just going to kind of Let It Go yeah so this is the unfortunate uh by
1:15:40
oh okay we're going very deep for this one cuz in a lot of trouble and down he will go corki via picks up first Blood
1:15:48
very nicely set up there by Raptor that's a trade up because KT got one third of the feet FX got a full one and
1:15:58
yeah cuz thinking he get away there but obviously Raptor taking a very deep drone is going to pay with his life for
1:16:04
those Raptors um he is Raptor so obviously he gets bonus gold from the
1:16:11
Raptors um kind of goes without saying now he's this is actually very annoying um
1:16:18
it's it's buying a lot of time B's missing XP and gold and mid and stuff like that um he's still going to die but
1:16:25
either way uh it's kind of funny that he he set up this awesome first Blood he
1:16:30
got the feed of strength and he's like now I deserve to int for the Raptors I've done my job here nothing is
1:16:37
a better encapsulation of of a new player in the LC particularly for junglers cuz it's a role that's so
1:16:43
heavily based around not necessarily your mechanic they are pretty based yeah
1:16:48
agree your pathing and your knowledge one of the reasons why peanut is as
1:16:53
revered as he is uh looks like Raptor also going to be going for an early hard steal most
1:17:00
likely I've seen a lot of Tanks just opt towards that build and even with the
1:17:05
Raptors as expected and and with the fact that he died cuz is still able to maintain his CS Le but we have already
1:17:12
word that I think on the the next patch point two they are changing it to First of threee which feels a lot more even
1:17:19
and I think is a change that is going to be generally welcomed and while still maintaining
1:17:26
um a little bit of an incentive to be bloodthirsty which I appreciate yeah absolutely it feels a little bit more
1:17:31
like okay well if we win this first team fight or if we if we win this first early laning phase or if you know
1:17:38
somebody really pops off in a big way rather than just like winning one trade and oh I got them and now we've got this
1:17:44
huge feed of strength I I think it makes a lot more sense so it's a good change for it's also we're still early in the
1:17:49
season and we've already gone for the full cycle of if you lose First Blood and Feats the game is done to boots are
1:17:56
insanely and they did get hot fixed to be fair to no actually upgrading boots is bait and you should never spend the
1:18:02
money so I'm not sure where we are on the scale as of right now suffice it to say the boots are nice not by itself
1:18:10
going to be uh something that is going to win Oria the game as we do have Raptor on a big flank here corki on the
1:18:16
way as well hey just alting the whole team here on the bottom side we got teleports coming in as well the dyal is
1:18:22
huge value because is getting burned to a crib down he goes as T will pick up that kill but he is going to pay for it
1:18:29
Raptor in a lot of trouble as well perfect and bdd going so deep for it and clears Al basically does nothing but now
1:18:35
via on the flank on the top side doing a bunch of damage but he's in early game Corky with just a tiar in a face he
1:18:42
doesn't really do that much damage and so just kind of a cheerleader as diao getting knocked up here has to use his
1:18:48
alt and that is just Y in a nutshell KT going to win this trade big time blood
1:18:55
bath in the bot Lane valis it all starts Raptor does get spotted and initially it
1:19:01
looks a little dicey the Braum combined with the Zyra so much disengage but the
1:19:07
only one taking damage are the Leona with W up and Raptor so when all these
1:19:12
TPS start to come in KT is still in a great fighting spot I think they're also a little bit quicker on the trigger and
1:19:20
unfortunately without the lockdown still there the value of Rumble for example is
1:19:25
really going to drop this clear is equalizer there doesn't really get to do nearly as much whereas perfect in a
1:19:31
first scrimmage with a strink and his old top is going to be a big manace and a big early win for KT
1:19:37
here yeah it does feel pretty nice now bfx at least are going to try to get one
1:19:43
grub um so that's that doesn't feel great and cuz should be able to at least
1:19:50
oh well I say that here comes Raptor and Kellen that's a big UL for Kell they're just really abusing the lack of Mobility
1:19:58
on the Zyra now but a bunch of damage coming out from Duck they're taking a 3v4 right now as the rest of bfx is on
1:20:04
the Run they get the kill on to clear and Raptor in a bit of trouble as well now finally we're going to get the TP
1:20:09
from corki but again what is corki going to do here he doesn't do any damage right now and they might just look to
1:20:16
turn on him as well vla he's got his flash he flashes directly back into them
1:20:22
and just dies what am I watching
1:20:27
chronicler I don't have an answer why are you why are you throwing the ball to me I'm same game don't take it away
1:20:34
chronicler watching the same game as you and this is kind of I think the issue
1:20:39
with going in too aggressive on the Zyra like yes you kill cuz but his plans
1:20:45
actually end up getting the grub which is what you were kind of looking for so they still go to five and then bdd is
1:20:52
just getting untouched in these fights Zyra like brand is one of those Champions where if you don't hung the
1:20:58
derer he still got up an ultimate he still got a ton of plans out you're just not really going to be able to and the
1:21:04
fact that not only does KT
1:21:09
the okay they got what like two more kills on yon yeah two kills on yon yeah
1:21:17
dockum goes unchecked throughout that entire fight and you're playing a longer fight
1:21:23
like especially the skirmish you get multiple rotations of Braum ashon is so
1:21:29
strong like the amount of CC the amount of sustain the amount of lockdown that you have available yeah Zyra too as you
1:21:36
mentioned before like even if he goes down like plants are doing their job so funny to see Raptor desperately trying
1:21:42
to get the grub against the plants and losing um it just it just feels pretty
1:21:49
rough now BMF did get the first blood but the objective uh feat is about to go
1:21:54
the way of KT and all of their lanes are winning so yeah cuz having not the best
1:22:00
time but he's also he's got four assists he's ahead 20 Farm he's doing much better actually than raptor is which is
1:22:07
funny to say even though he has died three times so KT just as a whole as a team feeling very happy they picked up
1:22:14
the first Drake which is actually what cuz was saying in the uh the replay of
1:22:19
his comms there so it does feel like cuz is definitely calling uh a bit for for
1:22:24
the team which you would expect as Arrow coming on in Raptor not able to avoid it
1:22:30
and the CC chain is just so obnox he's got a lot of Health but not a lot of resistances as down he will go and
1:22:36
that's going to be the end of raptor once again and the biggest difference in this game I think has been the jungle
1:22:43
support Duos on either sides where it doesn't feel like Kell and raptor have really been able to sink up and it's
1:22:49
either Raptor or Kellen going in and the one time that it did work out was on CZ which then unfortunately uh didn't
1:22:56
didn't really work out and then I feel like way and CZ have been perfectly in sync and even if C end up going down way
1:23:04
then ensures that they win the followup fight man still has 100% uh kill participation as of right
1:23:11
now and thus far I think KT should be the favorites in this series looking a
1:23:16
lot cleaner across the board bfx had some okay moments and they still have good mate game fighting and that's
1:23:23
really where they going to have to hope that they can mount a comeback but right now I think things are looking great for KT yeah absolutely I mean coming into
1:23:32
this one you know KT were the favorites now in this position as you mentioned they are the favorites for the series
1:23:37
you would have to imagine and things are just flowing really well you know one of the things that we said in his interview
1:23:44
was I I've got a bunch of hung which is basically just older brothers in Korean I'm just going to piggy back I'm just
1:23:50
going to ride the bus a bit and that's fine he's doing a great job as Raptor in a bit of trouble here there's the knock
1:23:55
up from way speaking of which and Raptor will go down how do you play this game as Malai you throw out your alt and
1:24:01
you're stunned anyway and you just die so sad it's it's the offensive bra
1:24:07
mod and it works that's not supposed to happen all you need is the setup from
1:24:13
the rest of the team it looks like now we're going to look towards first turret would even with that first
1:24:20
Blood basically guarantee KT even that they already up two objectives and we
1:24:26
talk a lot about defeats as we should KT still got five grubs like that buff isn't going anywhere they're still
1:24:32
getting a ton of going oh come on wait it was still a sick Arrow I thought he
1:24:39
was going to go in they didn't do anything with it but it was cool it was
1:24:44
cool yeah so just you know casually face checking the brush
1:24:51
here just wanted to put down some visual
1:24:57
for what it's worth I don't think you have to walk up there I imagine that they just wanted to
1:25:03
secure Vision so that you could then apply a little bit of pressure towards that bot Lane but diao was still
1:25:08
clearing out the wave pre-level 11 the ability for kaisa to join was quite rough and I don't think anyone had shown
1:25:14
in mid but Raptor uh being a tank and having
1:25:19
aaly and heart steel felt relatively safe unfortunately uh not going to be
1:25:25
all right here we go nice block on the AL bdd may be in trouble but he is surviving for so long the flash is so
1:25:31
good as even an equalizer used on a bdd they finally take him down VI going to get that shutdown but what is the rest
1:25:37
of this fight going to look like it's not looking half bad for KT but we've got diao now looking that go in there
1:25:43
once duck Dom and he will take him out as he wins super deep for it though and he will be traded back perfect is
1:25:49
tanking for about a million years as well on top of the rip TD d he will in
1:25:55
the extended fight beat out clear and the rest of the team and that's another big fight in the hands of KT and with
1:26:01
this Rift Herald they will own the Feats if the Alo has a second item that
1:26:07
might have been the turnaround and here Kellen and Rapture do actually link up the problem is that there's no follow-up
1:26:14
damage initially look how long it takes for B actually go down and you invest
1:26:20
The Equalizer as well then a good amount of damage actually is done to docked on
1:26:26
by Diablo here you're like maybe they can make it happen but he doesn't crucially get the burst off and on the
1:26:31
other side uh the fight not looking too hot for effect easily able to sustain
1:26:36
and I think diao got a little bit over excited there thinking that he had the damage cuz if he just either like uh
1:26:44
have dog Dum flash out and then try to peel back and play the fight or you kill him like that would have been great but
1:26:50
not flashing over the wall definitely could have maybe led to a turn turn around now only the hole being dug
1:26:57
deeper here for bfx yeah when we were uh when we were watching that replay Chon
1:27:02
you saw my face I was watching perfect just absolutely Maul everyone that went into the pit to try to kill BD they used
1:27:10
everything to kill bdd and then perfect was was a a Dominus Renekton Kellen
1:27:16
stuck around to try to save via who was 100% dead he also died for no reason and
1:27:22
they both died and then perfect was still alive he got a third kill or a third you know Assist at least as uh we
1:27:29
are going to have this turret go down so bfx at least get that as cuz looks to send the ri T
1:27:37
potentially into mid here there it goes and Dia taking a ton of damage actually
1:27:43
as we speak meanwhile perfect up to two levels right now on clear he's got his Dominus rolling and he is so deep in
1:27:49
their jungle he just doesn't care as that oh SPID it away way going to have to out of there that was a little bit
1:27:55
scary but no charge pretty good for
1:28:00
bfx yeah he is he is mul perfect just went straight up mul first and I can guarantee you no one is doing damage to
1:28:07
that guy cuz V can't really walk in range cuz he'll get wacked and then the rest of the team is either doing AP D
1:28:14
it's the it's the the NY thing the drawing he did I it's like a meme from a while back where people I I assume were
1:28:21
like's got those old memes yeah it was like why do people pick Renekton and they just drew in paint uh I I think
1:28:28
just to Renekton going walk walk cuz he just you know presses W and then you die that makes sense yeah does make sense
1:28:34
and which is what perfect has been doing in this game huge lead cuz KDA might not be looking too pretty but I don't think
1:28:40
he's bothered whatsoever this game looking very much over here for
1:28:47
bnk yeah I mean the Fe of strength go the way of KT they also have the first two Dres with a hex tech we've got all
1:28:54
these extra bonuses and you know events going on on the rift so don't be distracted by the dragons as well we
1:29:01
didn't see as much focus on the dragons but uh they're the same so H Tech Soul
1:29:06
still very strong and of course we are going to have the uh vus atakan coming
1:29:11
out here as well and KT should just I would imagine just run it they don't
1:29:19
have to be that Brash about it you know they probably can be a little bit more
1:29:24
nuanced about how they do approach this objective but they're so far ahead that
1:29:29
I'm sure they're going to try to make it their way up here and try to take it down as soon as they possibly can yeah
1:29:35
do have to be careful we've gone over this a lot but Aon is is a scary
1:29:41
objective so this is the one opportunity that bnk have to fight their way back
1:29:47
into this game so I think that KT very wisely say well then we just don't do it
1:29:52
cuz you can't do it and we don't really have to do it just have bdd pushing in
1:29:57
the side lane someone is going to have to match him Mo the hex Gates maybe a
1:30:03
collapse possible B doesn't have Flash for a little bit but looks like instead will just be a bit of a still
1:30:09
mate and no one going to pick up the new objective for now looks very threatening
1:30:17
and that's that's true yeah I I feel like sometimes with Elder Dragon for
1:30:23
example Elder Dragon scary but Elder as as an objective is not that hard neither
1:30:29
is Baron like post it spawns at 25 now but when we got to like 27 28 minutes in
1:30:37
previous uh previous games never already felt that it's the power creep of
1:30:43
scariness in our objectives you know Baron used to be the big thing back in the day it was the only thing uh outside
1:30:49
of dragon obviously it was like once you got Baron oh that's so cool it's the biggest objective on the map you take
1:30:54
that down and then we added Elder we hadon yeah that's the that's where we're at right now we are looking to just
1:31:03
death brush someone maybe it'll work and and Perfect's better than that now I I feel like in his first season he
1:31:09
sometimes would have made that mistake he's like oh you know I got to put on pressure I'm going to farm I'm going to push up and he'd get caught from time to
1:31:16
time but no he he's a much more practiced player this guy as we know is he's got a very good uh work ethic and
1:31:23
has been putting in the work um and those Sid Lanes you know this is the lck way we have S side lanes that are
1:31:28
winning bdds ahead um Perfect's ahead so they're just going to put on pressure and slowly just choke you out rather
1:31:35
than actually you know just forcing an objective that we don't have to do they just want death St next he's never going
1:31:42
to die and currently he has zero deaths
1:31:48
yeah I think it's going to remain that way I mean you can see bnk also being like what what do we actually do I guess
1:31:55
we just start up at a con but if we do then we're going to get shred to bits and they have a ton of AOE damage so I
1:32:02
don't think we want to do that trying to force a 5v5 maybe and yeah looks like the trigger is being pulled they got to
1:32:08
do something and it wouldn't be bnk if they didn't try to hard force a play all right well that's Leona solo flare right
1:32:15
on top of duck perfect kind of an awkward spot for him actually as now has to pop the Dominus goes over the wall
1:32:21
he's kind of out of the fight he does have TP for the rest of the team is getting caught as we speak Tuck's got to
1:32:26
be careful uses both Summoners and gets out but now we got the Malai ultimate bdd trying to peel just to get them away
1:32:33
definitely a dicey situation there for KT with perfect getting caught and nearly the rest of the team as well
1:32:40
biggest win here for bnk is getting both SS on dock no flash and clench available
1:32:45
for the ash they don't have their big team fight ultimates now but if they trade soulle point for Aon I think they're going to be feeling good but it
1:32:52
takes a while to take down this objective during instead setting up the Trap which I like a lot more but there's the Hulk shot which foils their plan
1:32:59
velv best and mean there's really not much you can do as you mentioned you know it's just such a huge health bar
1:33:06
like I I don't you can't rush this thing not when KT's around you just don't really have a choice and your lanes are
1:33:13
being pushed mid lane is being pushed bot Lane is being pushed bfx are standing around trying to make something
1:33:19
happen around Aon instead they're just losing around the map and it's not feeling very good for
1:33:26
them yeah you can see that KT was also not impressed at all like bdd for that whole sequence he had TP he was just
1:33:33
like yeah it's fine then I'm going to do it I'm going to take dragon and then I'm going to just continue pushing the side wave and uh call me if you need me and
1:33:41
they did not call round two maybe uh
1:33:48
yeah I'm trying to find angles for BN K here and I think there we saw bit of it
1:33:54
it is important to note that KT does not really have a traditional front line right like they have a great Bruiser
1:34:01
they have Braum obviously can take uh a large amount of Bea in but if someone is
1:34:06
out of position and they get hit by a clear ultimate uh couple of Autos from via and or
1:34:13
diab there might be an opportunity here and KT the place where they are going to
1:34:19
I think never ever give up superity is the sideline with how fed both perfect and
1:34:24
but in a 5v5 if KT Mis execute or if Doom gets caught again no STS right now
1:34:30
might be an opportunity but I do think B andk then have to pull the trigger on something doesn't look like that's
1:34:36
happening right now cuz once those sums are back up that sequence of play gets a lot harder to execute yeah the League of
1:34:43
Legends we love and know you know it's it's kind of like if you're behind you don't really have a lot of presence on the map so you can't really get good
1:34:49
positioning on objectives if the enemy team is doing well and aon's pretty much just another objective right so um KT
1:34:57
just doing the oldfashioned way and looking for clear here might be in a bit of trouble Dominus popped as slowly but
1:35:04
surely big equalizer but perfect doesn't really care with that M as to flash away but he will be taken down has to flash
1:35:11
away from that really strong turret but perfect with the solo kill might be taken out here but that means
1:35:16
immediately oh he's trying to TP away and he will get away actually there you go not able to be interrupted either
1:35:25
and Jonah strong gives us what we wanted Bel this there is the follow Raptor con
1:35:31
get into the pit that's the objective gone and everything goes K's way they
1:35:37
win the objective perfect gets out with the solo bolo and bnk
1:35:46
shambles okay thiss a very interesting play they are going to take out duck and
1:35:53
again take out is in quotes because he's going to Res back at the uh the camp as
1:35:58
now trying to get back into this one and KT just going to force it with their reses here going as deep as they
1:36:05
possibly can for as many kills as possible at the end of the day though I mean they only get one so not really the
1:36:12
best usage I would say of the vasus oton dive sequence that we always seem to see
1:36:18
it feels like bfx honestly handled it not so bad for being Delta really bad
1:36:23
okay Diablo's just going crazy though uh that's not worth it and the Flash is definitely not worth it either
1:36:30
so yeah I don't know about that one I do wasn't great uh unfortunately for Diablo
1:36:37
I think we're seeing some uh first game Jitters if we give him the benefit of the doubt going in very aggressively but
1:36:45
there was still the buff if the buff wasn't there and you trade your life for ash there might be worth if you keep
1:36:51
your sums it definitely feels a lot better and now KT no ad carry on the enemy team starting up Nash and looks
1:36:59
like they will be able to get it without too much of an itch can they get out though yeah I don't I don't think so you
1:37:04
know they're trying to force this one 4v5 if they had kaisa you know maybe you get something going in a 5v5 maybe you
1:37:10
can prevent the baron perfect goes in and gets so much health back and he's trying to take a vla and he almost does
1:37:18
as the Assassin bra gets in way going to take him down and and that's going to
1:37:24
keep clear around as well no escaping that as Baron is taken for KT and he got
1:37:29
to think that the hex te is up next in this whole sequence the only kill the bnk got was wayy the rest we all revived
1:37:36
F this this is a
1:37:42
Slaughter yeah I got I got nothing uh they're they're BK trying their best
1:37:47
make a play but they are lacking so much damage The Equalizer doesn't really get enough done and as mention
1:37:54
perfect is a RAID boss even if he doesn't die here like
1:38:00
this play is great with the buff there's not even anything that you can do way I assume going
1:38:08
QX box is here by the way I'm sure he'll he'll check and call it out for us if it
1:38:13
is the case but bnk we've reached a point of the game where they're just
1:38:18
trying oh God that's oh no the crocodile he's waiting oh no oh he's
1:38:24
waiting oh Raptor oh I feel so bad for this guy um he is going to use this just
1:38:30
to advance and advance to his death he's trying his best but his best is not good
1:38:35
enough and a big equalizer clear's going to up those damage numbers but I'm I'm sorry that doesn't win you very many
1:38:42
games Flash volley comes in from Duck after the Q lands from way and that
1:38:48
might just do it I mean KT we got perfect he's in the base he's just in
1:38:54
their face and not allowing them to do anything hex Soul KT looking to put an
1:38:59
end to the slaughter no there's been videos of crocodiles uh putting their
1:39:04
arms up acting out like they're people to try and lure people in you know
1:39:09
they're adapting at any point the crocodile the apex predator are you sure that's not aiing chronicler well don't
1:39:15
be fooled don't be fooled by what you see on the internet nowadays well that actually makes a lot of sense
1:39:23
I was believing a slightly more magical world Bel us but I guess that's something I mean that would be really cool actually if that were
1:39:30
real I guess it's not as uh perfect just as my dreams are dashed uh I know that
1:39:37
bnk is dreaming to make their Ambitions a reality but in this one I think that's
1:39:43
going to remain the dream just like uh the Ling crocodiles a crocodile were
1:39:49
they standing up as well like on their hind legs or no no no but if it was that obvious I would have clocked it okay
1:39:56
give me give me a little bit of credit I was just curious to what level uh did they get you um okay Kellen just trying
1:40:03
to make a play they're going to get Cous I guess as the is going to knock them up a decent equalizer as well now it's 4v5
1:40:11
very awkward fight here for KT but does it matter is the question and I think the answer will be uh answered very very
1:40:19
quickly as B bnk just trying to run away here oh nice Shield there clear barely
1:40:25
able to survive for a second longer raptor is up next and now KT will put
1:40:30
them out of their misery took them a little bit of extra time they wanted to take the hex skates they wanted to be a bit cleaner with it instead uh they get
1:40:38
caught and they win the fight anyway and the game is over 60 and 10 is perfect 81
1:40:45
and 6 is bdd it is a very clean game
1:40:50
here from the side of KT to take down game number one of this best of
1:40:56
three that was a big down VES didn't feel off mid game like there
1:41:02
was an opportunity for bnk to get a whole lot done and despite their best
1:41:09
efforts I think yeah the faces really kind of say it all not anything that they could do and meanwhile on KT
1:41:16
everyone looking happy they got their objectives I think they play the Skirmish as well perfect got to play one
1:41:22
of his favorite Champions and showcased why it was very often banned against him
1:41:27
as we got towards the end of last year it's going to be an uphill battle for bnk because this match felt very
1:41:35
one-sided from very early on yeah it definitely was I I still feel
1:41:40
like we have a lot of developing players here on the bnk roster and uh you know
1:41:46
one of a couple of guys that are there you know you saw at the end via and Kellen I don't really see them as shot
1:41:51
callers either I feel like wasn't really a cohesive feeling from the side of b k
1:41:58
i I'll have to hope that they can figure it out as the lck cup comes along because KT rollster it's like a
1:42:04
well-oiled machine already and you can see that cuz despite dying so many times most damage in the game not very
1:42:11
surprising Zyra so a very fun game here for KT we're going to take a short break
1:42:17
and come back with the space we'll be right back
1:42:23
a
1:43:26
I
1:44:22
spe fore
1:44:36
speee fore
1:44:56

1:47:20
again the bringing in I like it
1:47:28
the I like you the
1:48:18
back
1:48:33
right
1:49:16
hello everyone and welcome back to the space as we had our first battle between
1:49:21
the two teams that made it to play house but didn't quite make it to Worlds as KT go up 10 Z over bnk fear X welcome back
1:49:29
everyone Deon alongside what did and Ox uh also known as
1:49:36
wax always on never off that one was bad everyone I'm sorry
1:49:42
I'll let it sit for a while no no no let's let's move on that one was our most one-sided game so far in the 2025
1:49:50
season uh where did it go wrong her Hax uh I mean I feel like there was just
1:49:57
like a lot of fights where they kind of fell for the bait of the Zyra you know they were like hey we bid zyra's flash
1:50:04
let's let's targ out let's punish that and then they kind of didn't realize like what of the things with playing
1:50:09
Zyra is if you press all your buttons it doesn't really matter if you die and I feel like this clip really highlights it
1:50:15
so like you know the focus comes out of CZ cuz presses all his buttons and to really illustrate that not only does he
1:50:21
manage to turn the fight on he actually gets the grub with the plant um so job done even though cuz went down yeah I
1:50:28
mean I think I really like the the approach from the KT they could pick sejuani in the draft right and go for
1:50:35
the boring match up maai seani but uh they have C in the jungle so why not why
1:50:40
not just go for Zyra and play aggressive and proactive in the early game and I think that kind of worked out in the KT
1:50:47
o game especially and also uh it shows that how KT is really like being being
1:50:52
proud of their team competition yeah I like that because it was strength to strength raptor is someone on bnk 3x who
1:50:59
proved himself which is one of the reasons why he was coming on back where it's cuz returning to KT known as a very
1:51:04
solid player both teams investing into that one but KT Tak a slight Edge despite how many times that Zyra died
1:51:11
now our second highlight here is one again up by the rift Herald area and
1:51:16
this one is uh more of like an educational class here for diao yeah I mean I think it
1:51:23
good opportunity for bnk game uh look at DIA position here he
1:51:28
cleared the vision out and he zoned out both damage dealers and the moment that
1:51:34
he Ed in was really bad before that I think they kind of space them out really really good but after that kaisa ulti
1:51:42
they kind of fell out yeah I think the control will down playing around the vision with the
1:52:11
y
1:52:28
our an ox Pro tier so uh there's a new objective in the rift right yeah and I
1:52:36
feel like you know they still
1:52:50
leing ideal
1:53:06
head shot
1:53:15
you as you can see
1:53:20
right hello uh we're back uh very quickly sorry about that issue guys was
1:53:25
very funny on hour and uh we'll take the desk from here I know those guys on the space are trying their hardest but uh uh
1:53:32
D just thought that we could do a better job so as you were saying W did and a pro tip uh I think two out of three of
1:53:39
those guys generally do great work a uh you're on fin ice as 're going take a
1:53:45
look I'm joking I love vs uh going to take a look at the draft that we had and again a reminder if you're just watching
1:53:52
for the first some of you're a KT fan you haven't really known what's going on none of these Champions can be played
1:53:58
again now looking at these it's it's actually interestingly enough I don't
1:54:03
even feel like outside of the ash we hit that many Super hyow Y is up there but
1:54:08
desyra is not something that we've seen that much of maai also on that list so we'll see if the bands are going to
1:54:14
change when we get into our next game I'm also happy to report that I checked on the crocodile video and while it was
1:54:21
real don't you dare hold on let me let me just show you the picture that he thought was real uh he was just eating
1:54:28
so I still got I still got punked but it wasn't that's that's not the video I want to be very upfront about this I saw
1:54:35
an extra he thought that was real that was real uh surely uh people don't think
1:54:42
I would fall to thatat right anyway it was a great it was a
1:54:47
great draft uh from KT rollster I think the Zyra fit cuz very well and playing around bdd and cuz is always going to
1:54:54
work very well uh for this team yeah for uh BK in the next game it's hard because
1:55:00
this is one of those games where kind of everything goes poorly every lane was I think via individually was fine yeah he
1:55:06
was the only one that was doing okay as uh uh no Pro tip they're not going to be
1:55:13
able to teach you anything you have to wait till the next space they were really excited about it
1:55:18
as well cuz we have the group chat you know and they were like guys we have such good tips maybe they could have helped bnk pull
1:55:25
was but we'll never know we'll never know yeah so uh gon has a tip don't
1:55:32
believe everything you see on social media um just for all of you guys out there and maybe some casters I know why
1:55:39
I'm getting roasted by jesa actually I do know why it's because we roasted her yesterday uh forting
1:55:45
a that's true that Mak sense you guys can see you know the Korean desk going on behind us that's kind of cool
1:55:52
they they've got a cool setup over there although I do like our noxis features a little bit more on our space the color
1:55:59
well well not the outfits but our actual space you know it's more like no themed
1:56:04
oh no it's it's cool it it feels really awesome also to to sit in on it's great
1:56:11
which maybe we'll get a I haven't done that day uh how about a Val host experience good
1:56:19
enough for me um on Sunday I I think that's a thing um so game
1:56:27
two we are getting ready for group Elder here KT is part of group Elder I know a
1:56:35
lot of you are still out there like what's the lck cup what are we do what's group Elder um I do encourage you yeah
1:56:42
where's valid questions patch on some patches um I would encourage you to go
1:56:48
ahead and uh read a little bit more into it because it's a very cool system and so far group Baron and group Elder
1:56:54
are tied if your group wins you have a better seating situation going into the
1:56:59
playoffs and uh you potentially avoid knock off knockout right from the getg go so uh definitely a cool system we got
1:57:07
this time around but let's get into the draft for game number two you'll see at the top those Champs they cannot be
1:57:13
picked again it won't happen we'll have to restart the draft if they do
1:57:19
it andessa going to remain on the ban list scarner feels like a must red side
1:57:25
ban wouldn't be opposed to BK leaving that one open as o this is something that I think
1:57:32
we've seen the most particularly with yon and corki already out Banning 8
1:57:37
carries picking one early and then continuing to ban just more and more of them as you get deeper into a round of
1:57:43
fearless is quite strong hoping that eventually it leads us to things like Graves you know making
1:57:49
an appearance would always be cool scarner I think to me is really the
1:57:55
no-brainer and I don't think you should be banning scarner on blue side this is
1:58:00
an insane champion at the moment being case call I imagine is just that they
1:58:06
don't want to play towards but it feels like he's so versatile as well not really tied to having to play a specific
1:58:12
team composition just an insanely strong tank and kante this time does make it
1:58:18
through the draft will be big top here but with the angle that KT take and I imagine they're going to prioritize
1:58:23
picking up an ad carry here and pinching that pool further yeah I I think when you're
1:58:29
playing up against a newer ad carry in dible you know what his champ pool looks
1:58:34
like you know what you can take away from him and you can uh have duck Dom essentially play anything I mean this
1:58:40
guy even if you want to go back to the old days he could pick up an aelio I don't think you really need to dig that
1:58:46
deep on this patch in particular but he could do it Caitlyn a consideration now
1:58:52
very strong there's the Caitlyn maybe some Caitlyn Lux action uh
1:58:59
does appear in Arcane so I haven't watched season 2 I don't I think only ORS has maybe we
1:59:06
did as well I am uh what's your excuse I was I was watching I was
1:59:12
watching othero anime you know and actually I started it while uh I watched episode one of season
1:59:19
2 and then I got distracted and I haven't got back to it s that makes a lot of sense um is Arcane really an
1:59:26
anime though it's not really well it's animation it's not an anime yeah it's not an anime yeah yeah but it falls
1:59:32
under the larger the umbrella umbrella I would say jce actually can't believe we
1:59:38
haven't talked about also in Arcane also yes VI has already been banned and this
1:59:44
is quite funny but they might even end up playing Jinx depending on what the bands are going to be here for KT they
1:59:51
already have their 8 carry locked and loaded so don't have to be worried can
1:59:57
further pinch that pool and Caitlin is the type of ad that can really take over a game if she gets going early doesn't
2:00:05
look like it's actually going to be the case although this kind of feels like a soft ban towards the Zia as well but who
2:00:10
wants to play Z and the Caitlyn I hope not I can think of some teams and some ad carries that would do it anyway they
2:00:17
would yeah I also I got to say I think buong is super under prioritized right
2:00:23
now Wukong to me feels like with how strong the team fighting compositions in the game are at the moment he is just
2:00:30
insane also nocturn is something that yesterday was really heavily prioritized in both series was also picked up even
2:00:37
the dnf didn't win that game the knctr still looked amazing so we still clearly have some different meta reads as we get
2:00:43
into our second day of fearless yeah also very important update uh Max Atlas
2:00:49
Anderson has in fact watched Arcane so um you take that back he says and uh he
2:00:57
also watched it okay well that's that's that's great I'm glad that we could rectify that thank you very much we
2:01:02
don't want to spread any misinformation about who watched Arcane yeah but about crocodiles it's okay okay
2:01:08
can we let as as here is also banned here the
2:01:14
Aurora going to get taken off the table as well there is a potential for this Chase to go towards bdd instead of going
2:01:20
towards top side uh but it looks like the read from bnk is that it most likely is just going to
2:01:27
go to perfect to be played into D Cante with the Victor Lock in we will have the
2:01:32
confirmation that it is indeed the case and guess what you know why Victor looks the way he does I don't it's Arcane I mean you know
2:01:43
you kind of tell in in season 1 you could yeah I don't know what's happened in season 2 but you know yeah uh it's
2:01:51
not a big surprise oh diaab that's a throwback uh
2:01:57
that's that's also a lane swap I don't think you want to play zeran what most likely will be Kate and Lux straight up
2:02:04
that does not seem like a good time yeah uh the Zer itself with the
2:02:09
composition does feel pretty nice well yeah yeah Zer and
2:02:15
re again not a Duo that you want to play into Caitlyn oh boy okay bard
2:02:24
see what way is going to lock in here the part would make sense this is a
2:02:31
lot better into the Wukong and ra but does and even kante I'd say but does
2:02:37
obviously suffer from not feeling quite as strong with the Caitlyn specifically uh generally with Caitlyn getting
2:02:44
something that's a bit more Lane dominant feels really good because allows you to Snowball the lane early I got to say I when look looking
2:02:52
at these with the name blades off I take the bnk com as long as you can get the lane swap off not have the Z stuck in
2:02:57
the lane against the Caitlin which obviously will be a really bad time it is a lot of Team fighting Power great
2:03:02
engage uh nice damage spread lot of AOE CC versus composition that I think has
2:03:08
strong Champions but doesn't really feel like it gels together in quite the same way yeah it does feel like a little bit
2:03:16
tier listy right from the side of KT whereas their their composition last time actually felt more like a
2:03:22
composition that all works very well together um so we'll see if they can make it work I I think with the skill
2:03:29
Gap that we saw in game one I wouldn't be surprised like you were saying before you know name Plate's on or name Plate's
2:03:35
off you know maybe you take the bnk comp but um name Plate's on I have to say
2:03:40
that KT might just also bop them so um we'll see how it does go as we're
2:03:46
getting ready oh there's there's a is that that's aaman yep Pimon that's crazy
2:03:54
that's that's a throwback that's really well done artwork yeah that's a cool bdd
2:04:00
fan right there why is bdd aan I don't knowas what's the relation there I don't know enough about Digimon lore he plays
2:04:07
a lot of Digimon games apparently on stream said that's very cool good for you bdd I didn't know that that's very
2:04:15
cool just another reason to like him either way guys we have game number two it is starting right now
2:04:38
here we go game number two on the way another update from Bas gson apparently
2:04:43
his second account in Solo CU bdd is named aan can we verify that cuz he does
2:04:49
kind of look like a crocodile and I don't want to I don't want to get pranked again today uh we have confirmation from Jon
2:04:57
that this is in fact uh real so that's good to know is the lane swap that I
2:05:03
imagine BF uh bnk sorry is going to look for is not spotted yet we do actually
2:05:11
have KT going for the same obviously with Caitlyn it is one of those situations where I think if you're
2:05:16
laning you're happy but if you're just hitting a turret and Zoning a Melee character out of a lot of experience and
2:05:22
waves and you're also going to be feeling good there's a lot of vision though here towards the top side of the map so being a will have a ton of info
2:05:29
as to where everyone is going and what the pathing of CZ is going to
2:05:35
be and just going to be perfect by his Lonesome playing I imagine this is going
2:05:42
to be not the tank Jace uh as he uh nice use of the gate there to dodge from that
2:05:48
crash down trying to get his experience in but uh we've seen both actual tank JS
2:05:54
and just going grasp and health items like Cleaver for example is always going to feel really good both on Jace because
2:06:00
of the W and how quickly you can stack it but also in Cante as a tank match up um but they don't have that much
2:06:08
front line uh with wayy being y one although I guess sinzo is deceptively
2:06:14
tanky as well see what build ends up going for yeah the Sha and the poppy together uh they've got a couple of
2:06:19
circles that could uh create a lot of space you know they're they don't especially cuz support poppy not going
2:06:26
to be ultra tanky and then shinda isn't the tankiest jungler obviously so they're not like
2:06:32
tanks normally uh that you would expect uh but they can create a lot of space
2:06:37
and uh provide a front line for the team at least so we'll see how it does go Kellen
2:06:43
is hanging around in the top River just saying hello to his friend way clear is not having a very fun time as he has to
2:06:50
Lane into C instead of uh dible he is the sacrifice
2:06:55
he is the top laner meanwhile uh we do see that perfect now is solo laning against
2:07:03
dible and might be just fine with that here comes Ken up to the top side yeah duckon taking that turret shot
2:07:10
again a reminder turrets hit way harder now so that's a much bigger mistake than it would have been
2:07:16
previously noxus turrets just hit a little different to see a lot of trading
2:07:21
in mid between bdd and Via but neither of these two Champions should be
2:07:26
expected to do a whole lot of solo killing early on just going to be look at the scale was O clear wasn't that far
2:07:33
off the wall that could have been a lot worse had that hit nice attempt there from way yeah you know maybe he should
2:07:40
have just gone ahead and uh full sent it unlock the hex Flash and uh knock him into the wall
2:07:46
100% maybe put on a bit more pressure in your your pop you've got hex Flash but
2:07:51
just playing a cal you know they don't know exactly where the ra is is this this match up as I said I feel like this is pretty good for perfect he's going
2:07:58
for the kill going to die anyway instead as diao takes him down perfect a little
2:08:05
bit of hesitation in that trade maybe if he committed to it 100% he would have
2:08:11
taken him down in said he is the one who goes down that's huge as well getting a
2:08:17
kill on the one member that you want fet for BN k perect also having to use his
2:08:23
teleport immediately do note that both the barrier and the flesh were used but
2:08:29
yeah I think perfect felt with the extra resistances on his melee form that he
2:08:34
would be good but not going to be the case it's also one of those scenarios where with conqueror probably win that
2:08:41
but with grasp you know in short trades a lot stronger also obviously going to get a ton of value out of that resolve
2:08:47
tree but taking a really big risk there does not end up paying off and bnk looking
2:08:56
better here early on and just going to dash over the Rocks there but Vias stunned in the field he
2:09:03
will commit to the flash but the Victor could chase down going to tank the turret even flashes away but he's so low
2:09:09
as Raptor desperate he wants the kill and he will trade it back as way just kind of saunters off there and does get
2:09:17
away so a trade one for one at the end of the day and another reminder of how
2:09:24
scary the turrets are so we take another look here see lethal Tempo slowly being
2:09:31
he still tanks the Q and he still wins it that's crazy go the cuz nla cheering on his uh his
2:09:43
teammate and going to the mid lane play via I think this flash actually is fine
2:09:49
we're still very early on so there is a decent the cool Downs it forces BBD to both further go in and commit his Flash
2:09:57
and he still end up getting a one for one trade bnk is going to be that's raptor getting a kill as well and again
2:10:04
Wukong realistically if he just gets the farm to six and his teammates are behind you're going to be happy getting an
2:10:10
early kill and possibly getting yourself some early objectives as well bnk looking very different in this game
2:10:16
number two yeah definitely feels uh pretty fun
2:10:21
for them I mean you've got your Cante unlocked up on the top side now perfect going to go up to there KT will be able
2:10:27
to take down this hex tech Drake at least so that's the one kind of consolation priz they get this time no
2:10:34
hex soul in the second game and no infernal Soul
2:10:39
either as uh see the aacon symbol up there on the top right almost
2:10:45
definitely well not almost actually just definitely is going to just be voracious every single time
2:10:52
so don't get your hopes up unless we have some insane kind of game some level one or something that really turns the
2:10:58
tides of the action there is a ward there on Dia and that is AER with level six so duck
2:11:05
really has to play this one carefully especially because he's
2:11:11
alone even if Kellen wasn't there I think dog J playing smartly the all in
2:11:18
realistically not going to be able to win if you are able to Whittle down dible with your Superior order range
2:11:25
should be fine but we can see there as well I think the issue is that yes you have a bigger range but zeri does have a
2:11:31
lot of inap ability not hard to get on top of you way now matching the 2v2 but
2:11:38
again that one kill means a pretty substantial lead and I think the gold is where you want it to be for bnk f the
2:11:45
only one that is a little bit behind because he didn't get the kill well BD did P only got the assist but still
2:11:52
doing solid in terms of experience and it is the type of game where both cuz
2:11:58
and we are going to have a much less fun time as in they go oh boy level six Wukong comes in and bdd doesn't have
2:12:04
Flash he's in a lot of trouble but actually just kind of walks it off as Raptor flashes in does chew through the
2:12:11
Shields and gets down the Victor but cuz might be able to at least punish this
2:12:16
one it's going to dash back over the rock so it doesn't stun as the Clone Bo him a little bit and now we got Kell
2:12:22
coming in as well wey picks up a kill but this is just a disaster for KT bnk
2:12:28
looking for more as wayy will just flash over the wall big wins there for bnk not only do
2:12:38
they take down BD oh okay uh uh bdd he just TP back everyone you might
2:12:45
not see it from his health bar but we also had to train the Lane which
2:12:52
seemingly did go the way of diao he still has his all to oh cuz there I
2:12:57
think he was trying to look for the timing to slow down Raptor but instead
2:13:02
he eat into the old and it just kind of kind of boomed him
2:13:09
unfortunately so I I get to take another look at that again and that is even oh
2:13:14
the yeah Diablo goes in for that one you know he almost one shots duck duck still
2:13:20
has his barrier and he's really not under too much pressure but scary moment
2:13:26
there that was also like he did have ult in like 5 seconds in the Alo took a bit of a risk is very clean setup here
2:13:33
initially Right comes through uh a lot of damage with the knock up and then
2:13:39
that moment right there that could have been otherwise something that I think turns it around if KZ is able to
2:13:44
actually get on top get the knock up and then bdd stays alive gets another rotation up would have been huge but
2:13:50
then here especially when you're fighting the Clone those extra Autos actually end up making a big difference
2:13:55
and then the fact that wey trying to save his K even as to invest his own flash does get hex flash but still would
2:14:02
much rather have that flash available going to be bnk nothing crazy you know these are not
2:14:08
game-winning but they do pain in a very different picture and as we said before
2:14:15
would anything be more KT as uh to to somehow take the L in
2:14:22
this St I say with caution because uh we're we're not close to it happening
2:14:27
yet but there are some worrying signs valz it is uh it's difficult to take the
2:14:32
KT out of KT you can never do it and here's Clea on the TP flank we've also got the Wukong Al Only Hits duck he's
2:14:39
totally fine way also walking it off he finally goes down but now we got the Z
2:14:44
and the sir moment beginning to brew here he's looking for perfect he wants cous as well he says give me all The
2:14:51
Kills I'll take them down bdd just chasing he's had a wild game so far he's
2:14:56
flashing FES that's a triple yeah he's going to get the triple on bdd is just dead I mean maybe he gets Raptor here
2:15:03
who's doing the crom I I've seen didn't lose those let's
2:15:09
be careful there gr get respected D's dead as well there four kills to the
2:15:15
side of bnk and they're getting more grubs so now this is becoming more than
2:15:21
just so KT are playing a funny early game they're just straight up losing BK are calling their Bluff this is so B
2:15:27
watch CLA here there is a blastone there and he just ice gold flashes over the wall
2:15:33
again in as soon as possible I think for me actually the biggest winner is Rapture does so much damage gets so much
2:15:40
celd and then gets out with his life bdd I don't think he really had to go all in
2:15:46
and and Flash aggressively to try and get the and then so if will just plays every single game like this regardless
2:15:53
of whether he's ahead or not at least we'll have fun vales uh as now four and
2:15:58
zero on the Z and the the comp of BF of bnk is going
2:16:06
to continue to be good like this is not a situation what we saw yesterday were like oh it's a n what what can they do
2:16:13
and just on the day where wolf isn't there we have a four Oar 12 he's
2:16:19
watching at home Shirley I'm sure you can certify it uh for us uh officially
2:16:24
but yeah there should be an infernal Drake going over the way of KT so they take that down that's the one thing that KT has is some Drakes and it's a
2:16:32
mountain Soul here which I feel like is going to be useful regardless bdd he's
2:16:37
just playing dying simulator he's playing yesterday like Fiesta um he's going to get knocked into the Rocks as
2:16:43
well and that'll be his fourth death there's now way trying to make it up for him will uh once again get the kill so
2:16:50
that's two kills now for way yeah that's that's kills for Poppy and they trade mid for support Kell doesn't care about
2:16:57
dying but bdd is going to miss out on a lot of Cs one and four at the moment
2:17:04
and these Victors have been seemingly just dying a lot like I don't know what
2:17:10
the combined Victor KDA is but I know that fiser yesterday couldn't have helped uh with did I say Fiesta you did
2:17:18
yeah which it is a n sh mid it just makes so much sense like almost impressed by myself like yeah this FS no
2:17:24
it's fish uh and and the game does also uh it was a bit of a Fiesta cuz here way
2:17:32
just ensuring that they do end up taking down Kellen but the fact that he gets the kill instead of cuz that feels a bit
2:17:38
rough does mean Poppy's going to be tank here but that's not really what you want the Saving Grace for KT is that they are
2:17:45
still looking pretty okay in terms of Feats as they have two dragons but if these mountains start
2:17:51
going over to bnk you're not going to get through them perfect is in fact as we look back to
2:17:59
what we talked about the beginning of the game is going for tank Jays so you have tank jaay zenzo a horribly put
2:18:06
behind Victor and Caitlyn and then you're playing into Cante and Wukong and and Wukong has a
2:18:13
passive that gives him ton of armor so you can't really give up Mountain Drakes but this is going to be defeats secured
2:18:20
here for bnk and if they end up picking up a couple of plated steel caps I'm not
2:18:27
going to be upset Valdes yeah no I think that's just the
2:18:32
right the right call no reason to get upset over it um and yeah I I'm not a big fan of this
2:18:39
tank j i we haven't seen it really in a winning position I feel yet unless that
2:18:45
happened yesterday and I missed it I was watching all the games but I don't I I don't recall that happen
2:18:51
so maybe we'll feel a little bit different about it as we see more games and we see it begin to win and see you
2:18:57
know where the power lies like there must be a reason why we're seeing it played more often than just normal Jace
2:19:05
but yeah from a losing position it just feels like you're not doing anything um
2:19:10
so yeah that that's going to go off but that is kante so I don't know if you can kill him uh way Al is going to go
2:19:15
totally wide and now he is kidnapped by the Cante uh does get away cuz No Escape
2:19:21
for him as he's trying to walk it off actually but clear just gets in there it's a total Mees of a fight and it's
2:19:27
going all the way up bnk they're absolutely shredding KT here the
2:19:32
weirdest fight maybe I've seen today and B K that's just their comfort zone A dia
2:19:38
this guy is a maniac he's crazy what is going on he's oh oh he's
2:19:44
not even going to get the kill oh he does have flash just a couple of seconds off but he would have gotten that
2:19:51
I I don't even recall him playing like this in in Challenger League like we used to cast them all the
2:19:57
time no I I did but I think at some point BK started losing a lot and then he
2:20:02
stopped I remember this being a thing when he very first came on to to Challengers but then I I still don't
2:20:10
know if it's the right call but it's definitely the call he's making as we take another look this is what we're talk he doesn't even have a mountain
2:20:17
Drake yet they don't have damage to kill a Cante here and then Raptor obviously very fed
2:20:23
trying to follow into the choke point we see another example of cus trying to have an impact and then Kellen and Theo
2:20:31
are great on the rotation they're in time all the coold Downs have gone it and trying to kill a Cante that just
2:20:37
shrugs it off yeah I mean at the end of the day if you're losing to this bnk comp you've
2:20:43
got uh a Fed Wukong a Fed zeri a Fed Cante you're not getting away like you
2:20:49
begin to lose and the issue is you know KT if this game goes a good 40 minutes
2:20:55
and we see something like Fisher yesterday uh eventually have his comeback moments then yeah maybe okay
2:21:01
but they're just taking every single possible fight that they can it's collector Caitlyn and Blackfire torch
2:21:09
Victor into a four and zero Cante F that yeah they're just never going to die
2:21:15
that itemization is just asking to lose here for the next
2:21:20
20 25 minutes well I I have a actually I think it's just losing the
2:21:26
game you know I they'll lose before I don't think I don't think we're going to reach a point yeah we also have some
2:21:33
defensive timization outside of of clear VI so which I am not the biggest fan of
2:21:38
going both Merks and Archangels cuz you actually don't do a whole lot of damage but you do have a six and zero Zer so
2:21:44
maybe Vias is just saying I just press e on top of Diablo and then they win the fight anyway so who cares
2:21:52
yeah and this is the start of the stacking of mountains vales if you
2:21:58
fought clear was already tanky things are about to get a whole lot worse and this just feels right I
2:22:04
think after an exceptionally one-sided game number one where KT just completely
2:22:10
obliterated them here we are there it is bnk versus
2:22:17
KT I I think we could have seen this coming um you said it at the top of the day you're like oh today's just another
2:22:23
six gamer because you know this series was the one you know the next one we have DK versus uh T1 that one could
2:22:31
absolutely go through games this one I was like no should be two I you know I think KT's got it uh oh boy you know
2:22:37
I've been casting the LK for a very long time and I still don't get it um duck uh
2:22:42
he's just maybe dead he is going to flash though to get out of this one uh but that's a free Caitlyn flash with uh
2:22:49
Aon coming up here in a minute maybe the lesson is they can change players they
2:22:56
can change trios they can go from from B way back sandbox to live sandbox to now
2:23:02
bnk uh FX but they're just always going to go in and if they're ahead it's going to
2:23:09
look good vales that's that's how it feels because I don't feel like bnk is particularly
2:23:16
playing any different but the Alo is six and zero he's like the same way that he
2:23:21
did last game from ahead from behind yeah well I
2:23:27
feel like uh both Zer and kaisa are Champs that you would kind of want to do it on but especially zeri even more so
2:23:34
than kaisa kaisa is like okay you got to kind of pick and choose your moments we also have really good poke once you had
2:23:40
free items you don't even have to go that crazy true he will as we saw he is
2:23:48
Dia I'm sure he's going to going to gain a lot of fans from this game which I'm happy about you know yeah between him
2:23:54
and lazy feel it's a good time if you love ad carries that Flash Forward yeah I like that that's good I feel like ad
2:24:01
carries they've they've taken they've taken it for too long you know they they've had enough of a beating and
2:24:08
they're like you know what I'm finally going to fight back I I you know ad0 carry in 2025 2024 2023 2022 2021
2:24:17
they've heard enough and uh now they're taking the fight too okay you're not telling me that like Peak Gil Force 8
2:24:23
carries were struggling vales I remember that stuff that was that was that was still getting
2:24:29
memes oh so bnk say we are so far ahead we can
2:24:34
just do out of and they're right this is a this is a different situation to the first game we had actually where KT were
2:24:40
ahead but it was like a little bit more of a it was it was yeah it was a bit more subtle and it was mostly game State
2:24:46
as opposed to just being what like 7K multiple item finishes
2:24:52
ahead still going to look as I think they should but look at Raptor yeah here comes Raptor there is
2:24:59
the WBO combo into the back line nice poy Al actually Wade trying his
2:25:04
hardest and the TP from bdd I do not know about that one actually I do he's
2:25:11
dead and not going to do anything and neither this tank Jace as he will go down B and K they don't get the Aon but
2:25:19
they don't need the he's just flashing into like three people again he doesn't care oh man uh BK going
2:25:28
to get out of and they were already aggressive they're
2:25:33
now also going to have the G available so they can be even more aggressive yeah
2:25:40
pen and Raptor just set up really nicely here flash q no opportunity for
2:25:46
counterplay but what I love most is just how ready everyone on BK is to just follow that up and this is the moment I
2:25:52
was talking about CLA actually gets the Y up and the ab's like oh I'm not close enough just skating over the wall is he
2:25:59
going to get me there flashes into two people me Shield me did he have to
2:26:06
probably not and now he has an infinity edge and we already knew that this game was kind of dunzo but with that Aon buff
2:26:12
being secured all right dible let's see it let's see the next level it doesn't
2:26:19
have Flash anymore send it down mid lane just solo Dash into like five people I
2:26:25
feel like if it was only him and Duck and mid he would absolutely just dive the turret just to have a
2:26:31
chance hey even if you only trade Health that's worth you know set up for a second
2:26:39
dragon ow I bonked on the head yeah this Wukong
2:26:44
is not just well you know old Wukong he actually kind of slaps well it's also is
2:26:50
one of those Champions that if they get ahead early the mid game like it just
2:26:55
feels so oppressive because they're not supposed to supposed to scale nicely into the game and then come mid game you have a really big impact in your team
2:27:02
fights all right here we go we're pressing our buttons and duom doesn't have Flash so he's dead and down he will
2:27:09
go again vasus atakan we are diving as far as we possibly can Raptor he is
2:27:16
Unleashed and we will knock up everybody in that back line they're only going to
2:27:21
get and nobody's dying they're so far ahead that they didn't even need Aon honestly just keep pushing uh why not
2:27:29
Boo Boo come on bnk oh there we go okay they're going free Ni I I retract my
2:27:35
booze no I re wait okay so Diablo just it's
2:27:42
fine all right so they're just going to stick around They Don't Really Care uh they're not going to play safe at all they're actually maybe going to get more
2:27:49
kills here looking for way Kell's like hey I'll I'll I'll do it you can't stop
2:27:55
me he's demoting them I think CLA wins this well I I
2:28:01
actually I think for CLA we're getting we're getting pretty close did you see the damage from the tase he might he
2:28:07
might want to go down like his buff is about to time out just die it's fine no he he's just
2:28:14
going to survive okay oh that was that was tight I don't know how many seconds he had
2:28:19
left left him that buff I mean now it's you know there he was dragging them he's going back into position to kill
2:28:27
them and I think bdd might just get away um but it was funny anyway I think that
2:28:33
CLE he's going to pretend like he still has the buff and he's going to continue to run at them and say okay guys come on
2:28:39
the game's over come on just just FF it's over uh go next we are ready the
2:28:46
casters are ready the teams are ready like KT they're not going to go down without a fight though that's a lot of
2:28:52
damage on to Kellen and those turrets you can't just quite tank them as much here comes diao Unleashed again and
2:28:58
that's 1,000 gold he just dies gigachad wait uh KT going to just get 1,000 gold
2:29:06
on Duck Dom end perfect I think it was uh are they
2:29:13
going to get Soul point off of this uh did they just throw did I just that they might okay
2:29:20
that's not a cter curse I didn't think it was possible no I'm like this game is over the casters know it's over the
2:29:27
teams know it's over what Diablo did just skate over an Nexus while the turrets will still maybe maybe I might
2:29:34
control them to do it well that's a a very powerful mind control Val I feel like that's more a better explanation
2:29:40
than what we saw yeah they could have just they could have done a lot of
2:29:46
things they could have gone for Drake they could have just waited for the wave but they did not n of those uh and and
2:29:52
usually he takes aggro so if anyone else has Agro like that play works out fine
2:29:58
but now they get a triple on dock they got the S this this still shouldn't
2:30:04
matter okay I'm just going to they should be able to get Baron two it's
2:30:09
down but it is that is the start of a very funny gold craft if it happens yeah
2:30:15
we might go full LPL here I mean we've got respawning Nexus turrets as well well uh there ways back we is definitely
2:30:24
dead he's going to find a way to get out of this one he is Poppy and the way out is Flash never
2:30:32
mind he's fine he has unlocked his hex flash he is now ready to use
2:30:37
it it's kind of heartbreaking that ddom got a triple and he still doesn't have a third item whereas diao is sitting on he
2:30:44
also got a th000 gold shutdown yeah no I know and and the Apple's sitting on a lot
2:30:50
so KT I mean they're they're just trying to stop this Baron from going down as that is a big combo but that front line
2:30:56
is very tanky but as you mention kronic they just don't have any damage they still don't have any damage Here Comes
2:31:02
via he is going so incredibly deep for this one with the wall and he is going to trap cuz as that will go bdd we've
2:31:10
got cuz in a bad spot here too and finally tble he is going to find his moments to actually make the right call
2:31:17
and dive as far as he possibly can the game is now over it was in fact
2:31:23
uncurable and we will be moving on to game three in the series between B and K and KT to the surprise of
2:31:30
nobody what a game fell this oh I'm going to I'm going to remember this one
2:31:36
for for many reasons is it for uh Diablo the good parts is it for diao the bad
2:31:42
parts is it KT taking an incredible game number one then having a draft that makes go I'm not so sure about that and
2:31:49
then uh getting completely bopped it might be all of those things but I do
2:31:54
want to highlight if bnk win this and the expected favored T1 wins as well
2:32:00
then all of a sudden grou Baron on the verge of securing a lead in the LSK
2:32:07
cup yeah I mean they would definitely have a lead if those two teams did go ahead they wouldn't be on the verge of
2:32:13
it it would be three to one all right for group Baron most unhinged between lazy field Berserker and Diablo I don't
2:32:19
think it's Berserker I know he was very aggressive but it still felt like there was controls it's got to be aggression I
2:32:26
think it is Dia based on what we've seen especially because now we've kind of seen Diablo in a winning game as well
2:32:33
where he was even further even more Unleashed than we thought was even
2:32:39
possible and scores got a lot to say about this one
2:32:44
unsurprisingly coaching staff over there just uh not very happy with the way this one played out BD still did a lot of
2:32:51
damage cuz he's Victor but he also died a lot and it was not a very pretty game
2:32:56
for him yeah VI with the tank build he's just there to support the friends around
2:33:01
him he doesn't really need to do a whole lot and he was the main character in that one valis that was
2:33:07
diao and Diablo did his job he Dove over and over and over again after he had
2:33:13
that early Zer moment on the grubs and that's going to do it for game two we'll be back after the space in game three
2:34:12
you
2:35:17
J
2:35:42
hello Summoners welcome to the 2025 lck League format explainer the league is
2:35:48
entering an exciting new chapter packed with changes that will take the competition to the next level don't
2:35:55
worry though we'll be here to take you through everything you need to know so the first and biggest change is that the
2:36:01
LSK is moving to a single season format so no longer will we have spring and summer splits but instead we'll have one
2:36:08
continuous season and at the end of the year we will have only a single team crowned season Champion which means that
2:36:15
every single match that is played right from the beginning has a lot more impact and every team will be fighting for that
2:36:22
ultimate title before the regular season kicks off we'll have the lck cup this preseason tournament not only sets the
2:36:29
stage for the year but also serves as the qualifier for the first International Tournament scheduled for March here's how it all plays out the ls
2:36:36
cup begins with what we call the group battle so the 10 ls teams are divided into two groups and the top two teams
2:36:43
from last season will each anchor a group and then they take turns choosing who joins their group group yes the
2:36:50
teams themselves will decide their competition and once the groups are set the teams will play against the other
2:36:56
group in a single round robin format that's awesome when the dust settles the
2:37:02
results determine two key groups the winnner group and the losers group the
2:37:07
top three teams from the winners group Advance straight to the playoffs while everyone else heads to the play-ins the
2:37:14
playin will then determine the final seeds for the semi double elimination playoffs at the end of it all one team
2:37:20
will be crowned lck Cup champion and earn a ticket to the first International Tournament of the Year
2:37:29
extravagance after the lck cup and the first International Tournament the regular season begins the regular season
2:37:35
is divided into two phases the first phase consists of rounds one and two held before the MSI mid-season
2:37:42
tournament during this phase all 10 teams will play a double round robin format over N9 weeks at the end of these
2:37:49
rounds the top six teams advaned what we're calling the road to MSI the road to MSI is a special five round King of
2:37:56
the Hill format teams battle it out to determine the two lck representatives
2:38:02
for MSI it's fast high stakes and a perfect warm-up for the international
2:38:07
stage amazing after MSI the regular season resumes with around three four
2:38:13
and five teams will be split into two groups based on their standing so far we'll have the legend group featuring
2:38:19
The Top teams and the rise group where the remaining teams compete each group
2:38:24
will play a triple Round Rob in best of free format with every single match adding to the tension as we approach the
2:38:30
playoffs super cool once the regular season ends we enter the playoffs but
2:38:35
before the playoffs proper there's one last hurdle the play-ins the fifth place team from the Legend group and the top
2:38:42
three teams from the rise group will compete for the final two playoff spots this stage features five T best of five
2:38:49
match matches so expect some incredible games the playoffs themselves adopt a full double elimination format starting
2:38:55
right from round one that's a big change from previous years where losing early could mean instant elimination so now
2:39:02
every team gets a second chance ensuring that the best truly rise to the top the
2:39:08
top two teams from The Legend group get a buy into round two while everyone else battles from round one at the end of it
2:39:15
all the LC Champion is crowned and with it they secure the top seed for worlds
2:39:21
speaking of Worlds there's another big change for 2025 unfortunately there will no longer be a regional qualifier but
2:39:28
instead your path to Worlds is determined entirely by the lck playoffs so where you finish in the playoffs
2:39:34
determines your spot on the global stage simple clear and more competitive than
2:39:40
ever so that's the new lck format for 2025 from the high stakes lck cup to an
2:39:45
expanded regular season and a revamped playoff system this year promises to deliver more action more strategy and
2:39:52
more Unforgettable moments than ever before see you on the rift
2:40:31
thanks to the guys for that super cool explanation video on the 2025 lck season
2:40:38
we're here one to one as KT cannot close it on out and bnk FX find a way to make
2:40:45
an even more dominant Victory here in this series between these two squads Deon alongside oxen W did and uh jent
2:40:53
that was yet again another very one-sided game yeah I feel like kg kind
2:40:58
of thinking they were playing TFT with the Arcane composition but it kind of didn't really come together not really
2:41:05
uh and also like we saw I mean to me the thing that really makes sense is it had like the Jace and the Caitlyn and
2:41:11
clearly the intent with these picks is to get early lead but the early Lane assignments kind of didn't really work
2:41:17
out for that regard cuz we ended up with this swap situation where you have Caitlyn poppy into Cante re and you just
2:41:24
can't really get that much pressure I also think you know we often see the c p with like something like a Lo to really stomp Lane you didn't get that H and
2:41:31
then we end up with a zeri against the Jace and um yeah I'm not sure this is
2:41:36
supposed to happen but it's it's not ideal and I think it's especially funny that the flash was kind of misplayed the
2:41:43
shock B still hit and dble still won yeah I mean he got hit by every single spells but he still managed to to kill
2:41:49
Jay somehow and then I think this kind of Accel accelerated the game uh to bnk
2:41:56
because I mean KT should have win the laning phase should have win the oi game but they have the JS at Caitlyn but they
2:42:03
somehow lose the O game and then that kind of sbles the game towards bnk side yeah and good to see diao after a couple
2:42:10
of very high-profile mistakes in game number one stay aggressive and win in that 1 V one that could have completely
2:42:16
changed the way the game played out here I fact da just fits this team like the aggressive style that we've had from bnk
2:42:22
FX so much it's just he's locked in with them he's he's all in and I think this play is really good cuz we see the sync
2:42:28
engages Kellen stuns the poppy which allows Raptor to engage on the Caitlin H and that synced engage timing means the
2:42:35
poppy peel isn't there and it's dable who comes in with the cleanup on this Zer the initial engage is good but the
2:42:40
cleanup just means the game is over yeah and also this kind of shows that how a KT's team cup is really bad uh at the
2:42:47
same time is because uh when you see the bnk side it's really easy straight up uh Team comp because you just go in
2:42:54
together and then just press right clicks and then you kill everyone but uh KT side you have Caitlyn and Jay and
2:43:01
bigor but you have Poppy and zenzo which is like looking for uh some messy team
2:43:07
fights you know so I feel like KT team comp didn't work really well together so
2:43:12
that's why bnk drafted really well yeah and shout outs to Kellen and Raptor for making that play happen on the Wukong on
2:43:18
the realing ining it on up and then finally we have our last replay here oh sorry no we've got the gold difference
2:43:24
here between these two squads oh these games super snowbally and generally we expected things to be more snowbally
2:43:30
with like the feat of strength and stuff but these in different directions were just complete Stomps yeah when you think
2:43:36
about the lck whenever you are winning the oi game you were not doing anything that much but this patch you have the
2:43:42
new Rift and new objectives right so you have so many things to do on the rift when you're ahead in the early game so I
2:43:48
think that's why that's uh really snowball nowadays yeah and we have so this is the moment they had the attam
2:43:54
buff the revives they went in they died this is pretty part of the course this is pretty what we expect yeah but I
2:44:00
think the Hallmark cuz every other team they get the buff they're like now it's time to be aggressive I feel like being
2:44:05
K fax they're just aggressive like the buff is kind of like oh we actually revive when we die cool it's an
2:44:11
afterthought cuz they lose the buff and then like they make a play that you
2:44:17
would only expect to see from team that have the buff where I mean Dao you know I love him but a little bit over
2:44:25
aggressive I mean they could end the game here definitely but uh as you mentioned they don't care about the
2:44:31
atakan they don't care if they have buff or not they are just fear X they're just going in that's what their team color is
2:44:38
see Champion kill Champion it's that simple yes that's why I like their play style and also the team comp wise I
2:44:44
think Ru kind of build up they already know their team kala and they know how uh when they're good so I feel like
2:44:51
their team comp is always like really team fight around and also putting Dia on the hyper Ed cares yeah live by the
2:44:58
fearlessness die by the fearlessness as we take a look at the Fearless draft results so far these are the 10
2:45:04
Champions or the 20 Champions that have been played cannot be played anymore what sticks out of you ax here for
2:45:09
something that hasn't been picked Jack maybe a power pick here for game number three as we take a look at KT uh I mean
2:45:15
I can't think of anything specifically off the top of my head I know like the Sani didn't get really a looky we talked about that in game one but I feel like
2:45:21
having that early pressure has been really important for these teams so if something does end up going through like maybe the varus the kist that will
2:45:28
definitely be snapped up it feels like the early pressure as we've seen both games I mean snowball has been a massive
2:45:34
Factor all right well that music means it's time to get ourselves back to the rift for the deciding game here again
2:45:40
group Elder and group Baron all the teams up and down those rosters hoping for a win for their side who will get it
2:45:46
let's find out as we send it back on over to the casters for game number three thank you spacers for that
2:45:53
wonderful breakdown yes we'll have to wait and see if Sani makes it but honestly after the ban in game two and
2:45:59
the fact that now we've had 20 Champions that are also Perma bands um alongside of the new bands that we're going to
2:46:05
have here in game three I think we might be digging deeper than you know some of those very op Champions uh that we
2:46:12
have't seen band so far so very curious uh to see what does make it across the line you know Cante Bann in game one
2:46:19
played in game two so we don't get to see him thankfully we don't get to see tank Jace
2:46:24
anymore maybe next season uh maybe next series hopefully next season maybe next
2:46:30
season or maybe not in that season either but how about in the next series
2:46:35
might happen we'll see going have to wait for a while
2:46:41
longer because BK bring us to a game number three although depending on your
2:46:47
feelings on KT might be feeling like anything that happens just is their fault or you know their effort which
2:46:55
they have even me who generally doesn't believe in curses sometimes KT just
2:47:01
seems like they have a sort of mystical Aura around them as the vehicle going to get taken away but you're the best
2:47:08
Caster cursor out of the the whole tal aren't real vas we talked about this many times but you still are the best at
2:47:15
Caster cursing so I don't know how that works I don't I don't that's that's confirmation bias it's not real it's
2:47:21
fine we don't have to get into this all discussion again cuz it's only jungle V does far vgo knockturn taken off the
2:47:27
table scarner as well continuing the uh Banning of scarner by being kale though
2:47:32
in this case they're on red side so that makes a lot more sense Sani is still open I would imagine that
2:47:41
that one is taken away cuz it is one of the still higher prioritized Champs that
2:47:47
is up and I if we're taking VI away as well I don't think KT should I think KT
2:47:52
should just look to first pick it because cuz is all it or leave it open and cuz picks nly because that is an
2:47:59
amazing matchup and cuz absolutely dunks on people on that champion and Bessa
2:48:04
also available here I I think we might have to ban that instead which means that KT rollster in a really good spot
2:48:10
to potentially first pick Sani it it kind of leaves you in a hard spot maybe you leave them both open and
2:48:16
you say okay well at least we'll get one but I feel like with the two Essa bands in the first couple of games you would
2:48:23
imagine yep it's going to be a kalista band so now we've got both Amba and sejuani available for game
2:48:32
three most likely a trade of those I would prefer the ambassa pick up cuz
2:48:37
again I think KT either cuz ends up playing nly or he ends up playing sichani and I think he's happy either
2:48:43
way but NOP going to be the prioritization on that s for cuz and it
2:48:50
does make sense we've seen this player be exceptional at the pick for a long long time now being K what is going to
2:48:57
be their answer Rapture with the role that he plays on the team I don't really see him playing something like the N we
2:49:05
have the Mala already taken away because was played in game number one so we'll see what the answer is going to be as
2:49:13
ambessa here for CLA or via you go probably our best ambassa performance so
2:49:18
so far and that was from the mid lane going to be an early prioritization for Kellen on the
2:49:24
raan are we are we are we Zing is that where we're we are in game three L that's so
2:49:31
sad well might be asreal Diablo got to play kaisa and Zer and got a lot of fans
2:49:38
by his absolute wackiness I'm sure he can find a way to play Zia aggressively vas I just don't want him to play Zia at
2:49:46
all uh the ja is good it's great alongside of the zani and we
2:49:51
get to see BD's air so this is something that we were talking about at the beginning of the day is that bdd and cuz's champo is very deep B doesn't have
2:49:59
to go that deep getting uh zir for game number three it's not extremely meta but
2:50:04
it's extreme comfort for him and it's hard to be associated with
2:50:10
air in a league where you know Faker and chovi are also playing but bdd somehow
2:50:16
still manages to do so as there is the Zia locked in got to be ad carry BS from
2:50:22
here and out the Ezreal to me seems like a no-brainer and there it is and what is the other ban going to be
2:50:30
because you can either ban away something aggressive the Draven comes to mind or he can ban away like aios I
2:50:37
don't even think Champion is good but just cuz it's Doom you know what they should ban is zigs yes 100% they should
2:50:43
ban Z it's a lot of magic damage but zigs is fantastic into Zia oh yeah and
2:50:49
I it really just comes down to can duckon play it or is Ox going to have another aneurysm um those really the
2:50:56
only two options uh but I I think that's a decent shot I mean there's you're
2:51:02
really going deep into the S carry champ pool now with all these
2:51:07
bands we'll have to see no Varys no kalista no EZ Jinx still available as
2:51:14
well Lucian going to get taken off the board zigs is looking pretty juicy but it does mean as you
2:51:20
were saying that if they end up picking up something like I mean I don't expect anyone in the
2:51:27
El SK play a mundo but imagine playing into uh into a lineup like is on KT if
2:51:35
they do end up going for the zix we'll see what actually ends up being the lock in here jungle ban most likely here it's
2:51:42
going to be the silus instead taken away so not want to give that one to Via vla
2:51:48
I do recall also one of the type of players that do really seems to thrive on melee characters akali however is
2:51:55
still open so if he's not going to be picking that wouldn't be surprised to see that picked up do they want to do
2:52:00
that here though or secure a jungler for Raptor might want to leave it out up until the end and there it is indeed the
2:52:07
aali is going to get picked up here by a via that's a really good call I mean Ki
2:52:13
was a very strong answer into azir for many patches and VI is the exact type type of player so you call it crony that
2:52:20
is a great spot here's the Jinx you know you were talking about this as well you if you do not want to play something
2:52:26
like aak you've already got that air you can just go for the Jinx and and
2:52:31
try to battle it out in terms of hyper carry versus Hyper carry there in the
2:52:38
bottom side and duck Dom definitely can pilot this looking to uh go alongside of
2:52:47
the Lulu you know he was part of that AOS uh AOS Lulu Jinx Lulu kind of meta
2:52:52
that we used to have oh jarvin raon sign me up into Jinx Lulu in
2:53:00
particular when the flash is down that is going to be very tough to play out
2:53:06
the obvious downside of this is that the composition for B andk is going to be very well on how can they play in mid
2:53:13
game because if you don't get either the aali or the Essa in a good position you can Team fight with the comp but I think
2:53:19
that if you are KT you're going to be feeling a lot more comfortable you have engag with the sejuani you have a really strong front to back setup you have a
2:53:26
lot of safety that you can create for your Jinx but the early the mid game skirmishes outside of the Jack Sani
2:53:33
which obviously is insanely threatening I'm looking at Raptor I think he actually has a lot of agency to make
2:53:39
some big moves here in the early game and on the Wukong he was definitely able to do so KT though if they can get
2:53:45
through the early laning phase unscathed not give up too many of objectives kind of slow down the pace that front to back
2:53:51
is going to be disgusting yeah it definitely will be um you know azir Jinx what year is
2:53:57
it I don't know anymore but uh it still does the same thing and uh they've also
2:54:04
got Jacks and you have Lulu so just scale just wait you know feat of strength what are those that's fake
2:54:10
doesn't matter just be ready to fight for vicious Aon or maybe not just maybe give that up and wait until you're ready
2:54:16
a little bit later on and just win team fights later on in the game we saw that happen yesterday and win you can do it
2:54:23
with this comp that's for sure KT cuz going to do to do a lot of
2:54:29
heavy lifting when it comes to getting into that mid to late game this comp doesn't really scream power a little bit laning face power from that Lulu but
2:54:35
outside of that early skirmishes they're going to have to be careful if they can get to the team fights without getting this aali fed without having Raptor
2:54:42
having too much impact they should be good but after game two little worried vales yeah we'll have to wait and see as
2:54:48
we hop on the rift for game number
2:55:04
three and here we go game number three and already bnk invading the jungle a
2:55:11
little bit getting some Vision down checking the tri Bush as well as three just
2:55:18
going to see what the start is going to be for cuz if they can via still raming around
2:55:27
down here on the bottom side of the map will eventually go to Mid looks like standard Lane assignments
2:55:34
was wondering whether maybe bnk wanted to look for a swap Lulu can
2:55:42
be kind of obnoxious if you're not able to find an early window and to really
2:55:47
fren her and obviously with the zy raon duo I'm going to have as much power as with some
2:55:53
of the other setups that we've seen raan if it was raan kalista for example you be feeling very differently but Z has
2:55:59
been not very popular I think for a reason I haven't really seen the champion have a lot of success as we
2:56:05
take a look at the mid set up here yeah there we go yeah that's why uh I be
2:56:12
feeling a little bit scared if you are the Alo and kir both heals used and it doesn't look like Rapture wants to go
2:56:18
for any crazy level two Shenanigans and which you can do of course driving as far as level two
2:56:23
gankers goes is one of the best that we still have as a champion in the game but not going to be the
2:56:30
case yeah I I think that Raptor might be one of those guys that would consider it
2:56:35
oh yeah most of our junglers would just be like n I'm not I'm not doing that but yeah not going to go for it just going
2:56:41
to be playing it standard so Thea uh it was picked face up right they didn't
2:56:46
know what they were playing into in the bottom Lane but with the Recon pickup we were very much expecting it and so it
2:56:54
gets picked and that just allows KT to form this very ex not even just very
2:56:59
extremely solid uh matchup in the bottom Lane also match up for the rest of the
2:57:04
game as well I I feel like Jinx can kind of just do what Z does but a bit better
2:57:10
uh if she's given enough time that is and uh certainly in this Lane you're going to be given a lot of
2:57:16
time and that goes back to Rapture needing to have a big impact can be through GS can be through objective
2:57:22
setup but do think that they are going to be relying on him to either fix some of these Lane States via obviously just
2:57:28
once to gets to level six very desperately at that point you can start actually contesting the wave and
2:57:33
threatening bdd if you manage to land a shrien flip not going to be the case
2:57:39
just yet as gain not going to have his W available but again Dives are a lot
2:57:45
harder if this was the old turrets maybe cuz would have looked of something off the back of that trade but now I don't
2:57:51
think you really can also picked up his Scuttle and should be looking to base
2:57:57
here as we see Raptor has already done yeah you see he is the SK Bloom and he
2:58:03
doesn't care about giving way his position as we got a big trade up here on the top side and Bessa can of course
2:58:10
do that whenever she wants um you know he gives away his position and he doesn't care about the bnk bottom Lane
2:58:16
knowing that he's there because both sides know that he's not diving like it's just not it's not going to happen
2:58:23
um maybe if it was a bit more of a stacked wave and more aggressive bottom Lane something like that but even then
2:58:29
nowadays it's not really happening as we have seen I think it was also cuz his Ward that actually ends up being nice
2:58:36
for doam here so what happened there Kal is backing looked like Dia was going to join the back which of course was our re
2:58:42
you can do wasn't actually what ended up happening diao ended up canceling because dockham kept pushing so so I
2:58:48
again I think it was cuz might have been way but I'm pretty sure cuz dropped the ward as he was leaving that Tri brush
2:58:54
end up keeping alive and again for via the goal is to just not fall behind if he catches this full wave he's actually
2:59:01
on perfect parody so not going to be feeling too bad about anything and get to level six get a base in and from that
2:59:08
point on he can start making some impact on the map as that's very painful for the Apple
2:59:15
not going to be getting any of those doam hasn't backed yet has been able to build a small CS lead
2:59:21
here uh via might just die here flash comes forward but he's going to live bdd
2:59:26
not able to quite calculate that one perfectly and he could have just taken
2:59:32
the Flash and said okay that's enough but instead he wanted the kill H at least you know with via totally gone
2:59:39
from the mid lane he is going to TP back but this is a free dragon here for CZ to pick up early on in the game that's a
2:59:45
pretty big win for Via though BD also takes a turret shot as going to have to chug through his refillable and Via now
2:59:51
is going to ium ding six very shortly as his wave comes through this contest is
2:59:57
obviously not really going to be a thing most likely raptor is just going to use the PRI that clear as on top to
3:00:04
trade for the grubs and he had faded ashes as well I can understand that he
3:00:11
thought that he was going to have enough damage with the final Auto but not going to be the case Raptor now going to try
3:00:17
and trade the UPS no First Blood yet because of via surviving there yeah via surviving a lot of lanes
3:00:24
that aren't really getting too aggressive on each other outside of that one trade bit of trading in top side but
3:00:31
it's it's very much an even Lane State at this point in time and yeah just the grubs going to be
3:00:37
going over to bnk they will take all three of
3:00:42
those one to one when it comes to objectives
3:00:48
clarify that still it does still say 0 to zero in the top uh The Kills but it is also one to one in the series so
3:00:55
you're you're correct about that chronic that wasn't what I meant F but you're also correct about it well that's that's
3:01:02
nice I guess thanks yeah so far group Baron and group Elder one to one yeah
3:01:08
it's still an even score mhm yeah I I'm trying to think of more stuff
3:01:16
but I don't yeah no it's that that might I was thinking I think that was it exhausted it uh flash for Flash in mid
3:01:23
okay yeah that's that yeah okay I'll accept that teleport for teleport in top they're basically on the same
3:01:30
timer not quite the same timer in mid though no no it was desyn I I looked at that actually that wasn't one for one no
3:01:37
no no that was like one and then one yeah bit different count so as we are
3:01:45
seeing right now KT going to be feeling great about how this game has looked so far level six now starting to become
3:01:52
available Raptor W is and 0 carries flash is always going to be one of the most important Summoners in any single
3:02:00
game that's going to be Amplified by a million when you are a ad car without a
3:02:05
dashing playing it jarvin because the range from which he can get on top of you and lock you down is crazy and there
3:02:12
are so many Frets on bnk that are available Raptor going for a little bit of an invade here and this is the type
3:02:19
of situation where I would expect bnk to just look for any mid game Skirmish that
3:02:26
they can find where KT doesn't have a full setup because KT actually gets the setup in the traditional you know docks
3:02:32
in the back they have engage on someone they get the early reset for Jinx Lulu's
3:02:37
next to him I don't think you're really going to be able to do a whole lot you need to try and look for fights and skirmishes in Via looking for bdd there
3:02:45
this might be exactly the type of fight we're talking about it's a very weird one the ID carry is not really part of
3:02:50
this at all duck wasn't able to clear out the ward but also he zoned diao by
3:02:56
putting down some Chompers and yeah he saw him backing there so via just being a little bit
3:03:04
cheeky that was cute got the E then canceled BD's base and should now be able to maybe deny a little bit of Cs in
3:03:10
mid hey Kon what do you think the chances are of a runis Aon in this game uh well that's very easy zero cuz we no
3:03:18
action wait you summoned the action you're so good at the Caster cursing duck though is going to survive and cuz
3:03:26
comes in and says hello and that's about it but bnk will win the trade and now they've got via
3:03:32
coming down here maybe looking for an exit kill that really doesn't do a whole lot
3:03:38
they're zoning them off of the entire wave and the turret CZ really like that
3:03:44
was a really good timeing if he's not there Raptor at the very is getting a flash just with his old alone also happy
3:03:51
to report that the able did in fact go for his first old was an aggressive one expect to see more of that from him uh
3:03:57
you love to see it is now the lane swap comes through here cuz KT wants to deny
3:04:02
both six grubs cuz again we talked so much about the Feats six grubs is still crazy when you have any type of split
3:04:10
pushing pressure because it still allows you to chew for turrets in a matter of seconds so trying to deny that makes
3:04:15
sense but bnk have man matched the swap KT instead going to send doam and way to
3:04:22
Mid to take cryo there and now via changing his mind double TP almost available for the solo laners on either
3:04:29
side almost there for bnk already there for perfect and bdd we might have a 5v5 on our hands here
3:04:37
vales yeah I mean it definitely could happen I I feel like if you're bnk you are almost begging for it you know
3:04:43
you're like please fight over this objective K's level five though I think he really needs to hit six if they want
3:04:50
to go aggressive here there you go got of mid just standing in mid getting it
3:04:55
and I think you know one grub will go the way of KT here but Raptor gets on in there's that engage on a bdd but he just
3:05:01
flashes it and now we've got cousin A R Spot he's going to have to flash away in goes big CL just to die immediately way
3:05:09
too over aggressive say okay that's fine as they're looking to play front to back
3:05:15
here Kell getting low but in goes clear and he's Essa he's in there with all of
3:05:20
them as the jarvin traps everybody in this one oh the polymorph is huge on the clear actually will prevent bdd from
3:05:27
going down pretty dicey situation perfect thinking about a bit more and at
3:05:33
the end of the day you can see that diao you know he's at least able to tip away at perfect but we got a TP on the top
3:05:40
side via looking for a bit more everybody has already backed away bit of a mess across either side I'd say there
3:05:47
starts with via and the rest of the gang trying to go in on bdd so this knock up
3:05:53
from raptor is great Kellen investing I don't think was really the call and then
3:05:59
via's decision to follow up there great response from BD immediately he feels safe cuz he has the Shrout but then this
3:06:05
TP initially I think goes unnoticed clear ends up being there way earlier
3:06:11
then perfect is which means that that combo right there ends up I think winning the fight and then if clear just
3:06:18
decides to maybe play it a little bit slower there and gets the kill uh or rather
3:06:24
gets away with the rest of his team could have been a lot better now though uh grub only a single one was taken so
3:06:30
that objective is still on the board for KT teleports are used now across the board and I think most likely B and K
3:06:37
are just going to get the other two grubs and then try to also play to not give over the dragon and neither team
3:06:43
will get further along but because First Blood was found on Via KT still ahe throughout that whole
3:06:49
exchange yep always got to remember the feat strength and uh we got chronicler
3:06:54
right in front of me pointing at Duck Dom's flash as well so that's gone um we don't have Diablo flash but he's Z so
3:07:01
he's got at least a feather storm to survive a bit longer especially when you're going up against jarvin you really need that flash as you mentioned
3:07:07
earlier on KT trying to burst down the dragon you see that clear is here but he does not have Smite so I think you just
3:07:14
Smite it and try to get away that's really the question as y comes over the
3:07:20
wall clear continuing in on this one but KT just don't really want too much of
3:07:26
this at all they say okay we got the objective we get out cool ult but we've had enough for after
3:07:33
though should be able to stop some backs and be increasingly annoying Kellen here as well meanwhile it made Diablo's uh
3:07:41
I'm see on the going in two we'll see uh how that ends up going uh looks like he
3:07:47
is fine definitely uh showing some of his and that was a big mistake there about bnk because they were they got the
3:07:55
one grub so they've denied the objective but I think they thought that they could get the one grub then rotate fast enough
3:08:00
underestimated the damage from KT KT still got the dragon so second dragon now picked up it's a cloud Rift by the
3:08:07
way so Atlas going to be feeling great about that one and the good thing for
3:08:12
bnk is that diao is looking uh quite fed the bad news is that neither nor CLE
3:08:18
really seems to have been able to Cle was so close to getting that kill via was not quite as close could have been
3:08:25
big for how they play out the S side Lanes it's going to be a bit harder now although clear might be able to get
3:08:30
first tur blood here which means that the race is still on for those Feats
3:08:36
Valas yeah chopping away at this one thank you jarvin standard for giving us attack speed
3:08:42
yeah Jin's kit is uh it's very simple but it's it's also
3:08:49
got like a lot of little things in it as well I love jarin man it's like and it's also one of the very early created
3:08:55
character you know generally we meme like okay it's a new character it's got like a full novel you have to read to
3:09:01
understand it but J you he's got a little a lot of little things in his kit yeah I really like him as far as both
3:09:07
he's still and we are in a third game of fearless but it feels like as soon as eMobile 8 carries get a little bit too
3:09:14
popular he's always on the verge of making a comeback we still be high PRI pick in Worlds 2023 so even in the recent era of League
3:09:23
KT I still think that they're feeling great as long as they can get to a position where dockum gets a second item
3:09:28
bdd gets a second item and perfect doesn't really look like anyone is going to match him in the side at any point in
3:09:36
this game they going to be feeling good but they need to be careful because this is the type of comp where if bdd or dock
3:09:43
Miss positions once and they actually do get on the backline you can also lose the game no matter how good your
3:09:50
position is so definitely going to be a very tense game from here and out valis
3:09:55
and it's also by far the closest one that we've gone so far between these two yeah between these
3:10:01
two uh I mean I feel like at the end of the day if you're KT or just kind of sitting back you're scaling it's not like the
3:10:08
old you know air reaon as real Tom kench where don't don't remind me I remember
3:10:16
bdd on geni yeah you're just sitting there and you could scale or you could
3:10:22
just beat them over the head in the lane anyway uh with all of your very powerful
3:10:28
Champions um man Tom can support W devour was a was an ARA yeah cuz is here
3:10:36
and Diablo doesn't really do damage yet he just has a ER and a Zeal so he kind
3:10:42
of hanging out setting up Herold here is bnk
3:10:48
looks like they got a good chunk of damage on already via is in a flank position level two on the ultimate this
3:10:54
could be good for being K but KT aren't afraid duck has to flash away from the
3:10:59
ambessa as now we has to flash over to his ad8 carry just trying to fight front
3:11:05
to back but it's it's painful as the El comes in on a Kellen nobody does anything to Kellen after that old hits
3:11:11
him so very messy fighting reengage comes in and now we got the followup
3:11:16
here the aggressive Evol but immediately diao will be punished for that perfect takes him out as it is a two for two for
3:11:23
so far via trying to get back in trying to get out now actually is cuz looking for the Chase and he will have the
3:11:29
freeze that's a double kill for bdd and it will be KT barely getting across the line and Diablo does go for another
3:11:37
aggressive H but unfortunately for him that's also what ends up being his
3:11:42
demise it's perfect there with the Timely rival that ends up solidifying
3:11:50
this fight as a win for p and I think that when they saw their own health bars they knew must have known that this was
3:11:55
a risk so initially things look good diac can't actually get onto the backline nice hold from Wade there to cancel the e meaning that cuz stays
3:12:02
alive but they get Dock's Flash and that ends up being the herald of great
3:12:07
disaster as his mana's low the teleport comes in and still bnk say no we can
3:12:13
make this happen but look at how little damage they actually is on dock arm and
3:12:19
the fact that the Apple doesn't find the flash perfect just blitzes
3:12:24
him if either of those things don't happen maybe this is a win but bnk with those hellers must have known that they
3:12:30
were taking a risk and instead a huge win for KT as they get the herald and
3:12:35
win the fight yeah uh we were reminded by Gyan that in his interview Dia um he
3:12:41
said you know high risk High reward is my Play style y uh very much high risk
3:12:46
not much reward uh that time around but you know he's had a lot of big rewards
3:12:51
so far in the series so credit where credit is due but this time around that aggressive alt and no flash just means
3:12:58
you know it's really going to change the way that that that that fight plays out especially when you're being can you want to take these fights as much as you
3:13:06
possibly can I was about to say I I would imagine that KT is going to contest it they did invest a Teleport
3:13:12
though we'll see this is a moment where bnk can either try and really get a foo
3:13:19
hold in this game as uh we going aggressive on Doom here okay uh Kellen he pressed his Z
3:13:27
button for some reason so did clear well they got Drake I'm sure they
3:13:32
have their own reasons I just don't know what they are but we're not meant to know anything though us we're just watching the game yeah so duck was like
3:13:40
really far under the turret there and they really wanted to make sure he was punished for sticking around and trying
3:13:45
to kill the turret in instead they used two alts and hit nothing and looked very silly I don't know if this is true but
3:13:52
in my head even though Diablo is you know he's 17 he's quite young looks pretty uh pretty young as well in the
3:13:58
com he's like we can kill him we can kill him we can kill him go go go this is not based on facts just based on how
3:14:04
that play defitely happens I could see it look at the vision control here towards the B side of the map as well by
3:14:09
the way from KT didn't end up getting the dragon but I think did make that whole secret of play feel kind of weird
3:14:16
cuz I think FX BK were trying to look for a possible catching them of guard and then
3:14:23
uh they were very much on guard didn't really work out as via this aali needs to have an impact in this game even if
3:14:30
it's just a single kill onto dock on because otherwise this Pi doesn't do anything right has one job which is
3:14:36
threaten or at the very least Zone the backline and instead perfect obviously
3:14:41
in the 1 V one I don't think the aali expect to do a lot but even in the fights feel like VI's just been going in
3:14:47
and going down yeah I mean you got to wait for some items to come online I guess but
3:14:54
especially with a very iffy early game and the fact that uh azir has had a a
3:15:01
much more fun time it just feels like you're not really that that a colie pick
3:15:06
isn't really doing what it's meant to do we'll see if he can get some assassinations a little bit later on I
3:15:11
feel like the Jinx and especially the Lulu was just really fantastic into what we already saw
3:15:17
on the side of bnk and by that time it was like well bnk had to commit to it right and they go for
3:15:24
the j4 as their R5 pick right so I the
3:15:30
has so much value it does yeah even when you trying to jump on top of the back line right Lulu can uh just especially
3:15:37
now you press Redemption press heal press out even if you do catch Doom it's going to be tough and KT even though the
3:15:44
gold looks even I think our quite favored from this point on the game isn't won by any means and a catch
3:15:51
like this might be perfect undoing just going to try to flash it but can he
3:15:56
Flash the aalii he can't he doesn't have it anymore he's not getting any help from his team no TPS coming in this is a
3:16:03
two-on-one perfect just trying to hop around a bunch but you're not getting away from these two so just trying to
3:16:10
waste as much time as possible oh Raptor here's the flank not in range the
3:16:17
was close and what could have been if they actually get the flashh from dck them
3:16:23
there maybe a setup for Aon ends up just being a kill it's nice but not really going to be the turn around although
3:16:29
that is Shadow flame now done for Via so that is a big spike that was found and I don't think either team should do Aon
3:16:35
here I think we should just let it sit there and wait until we win the team fight because neither team seems like
3:16:41
they're far enough ahead to do this without incurring a pretty huge risk of
3:16:46
speed DD that's is that that's the first time right Rift maker is
3:16:53
there I've seen a lot of battle Rumble I I feel like you know the days
3:16:59
of tank air I feel like maybe one of those games yeah yeah oh yeah grasp tank air yeah probably would have seen it in
3:17:05
some some of those builds so been a while yeah pretty
3:17:12
interesting leandre's and oh he's doing a lot of damage to Ken
3:17:17
so I I don't think he's going to be feeling too bad we do have some setup being attempted here by bnk could also
3:17:25
be that their call is to just try and force a fight get Doom's Flash and then look for a re-engage but getting his
3:17:32
flash easier set than done and we're we're really seeing again like
3:17:38
Zia we're going to have to actually see diao be able to pop off in a team fight before we are convinced because now it
3:17:45
feels like getting effective ranges hard doom and BD both are going to just be able to poke you out perfect he's going
3:17:53
to be found here but this time feels a little safer has a bit more fog to work
3:17:59
with yeah he definitely does um you know the one thing I'll say is that this Z
3:18:04
different from the others this one is of course engage Zia true um different from you know the the scaling kind of waiting
3:18:11
a little bit passive Z that we see here in the lck generally diao is a different kind of Beast
3:18:17
I mean even movement ter like I can W up there are so many times where he's like
3:18:23
I'm going to engage uh yeah oh that's a good chunk uh
3:18:28
ster is doneo here for Raptor and he also has Sun so couple of AOS will get him into fighting shape vla will get
3:18:36
spotted by the wave here is this the opportunity we're waiting for Clear is there as well I mean there's just massive flanks from both sides the
3:18:42
Redemption but the AL comes in Duck do and the engage from diaa as well but
3:18:47
duck is alive they don't take him out and now the JX oh the combo does come in
3:18:53
but it's a little bit too little too late from the side of raptor and now clear is getting run down we've got via
3:18:59
as well kind of hidden in the jungle and KT just thinking okay do we just
3:19:05
continue to chase the ambessa or do we just take via down kind of a funky spot
3:19:11
but this should be some objectives here for the set of KT they will take down
3:19:16
this Cloud Drake at least and bnk thought that that was the opportunity they've been looking for but
3:19:22
unfortunately for the KT were ready they saw it coming and let's take another
3:19:28
look here so they are able to get on top of duck pretty early on the catch there absolutely beautiful but diao goes for
3:19:37
the aggressive flash but doam is still able to flash out bdd finds the knock back and then perect is right on top of
3:19:43
him and the rest of the team clear via these Champions aren't tanky enough to
3:19:50
just stand there and take the hit it's the Saving Grace is the fact that Raptor does actually get the kill on dock to
3:19:56
not make it a complete disaster but still look at the gold swing that is now there for KT I do want to remind you
3:20:03
though as long as that flash for duck is down bnk still have a fighting shot I think one more lost fight and the game
3:20:09
is over right out of Baron or ticon gets given up the map falls apart and KT all
3:20:15
they need to do is just make sure and at this point even if doop dies like do you even lose the fight bdd is 5 and zero
3:20:22
Perfect's fed I don't know I I don't yeah I don't think so I I think
3:20:29
they're just way too fed at this point in time like should there's just so many carries so many so much scaling we're 26
3:20:35
minutes into the game cuz is just going to catch Raptor as the damage comes in Duck going to take him that vas totally
3:20:41
alone he's just going to be cleaned up it's free it's just free food for k T
3:20:48
and I mean what are you going to do against bdd as well his positioning has been 10 out of 10 perfect in this game
3:20:56
it's one of the things you got to know about air it's not always about the flash he plays he's just right on top of Duck Down the entire time cuz sets up
3:21:03
the first kill he's ready for Via on the flank it was kind of a a sad flank from via but either way it's just perfect for
3:21:10
KT no perfect the top laner as Aon is going to take on KT yeah let me this one
3:21:17
time sorry you got me the the although that fight I think was lost the moment
3:21:22
that Raptor got caught we had an instant polymor so what via was looking there
3:21:27
was get over the wall and then get into his shroud and he just wasn't able to so here thek raptor is the tankiest member
3:21:35
on the team so someone has to stand in front unfortunately uh they can just engage onto him and he just dies doesn't
3:21:41
actually get look at that yeah beautiful that polymorph takes
3:21:46
away the one angle that they had because maybe if like vicla one Taps him and then the rest of the team I don't know I
3:21:53
think it was a stretch the moment that we saw those early fights in that mid lane play not working out but now feels
3:21:59
like KT should just be cruising towards the expected victory in a bit more strenuous matter than maybe was expected
3:22:06
but they are KT so are you really ever surprised no no no you're not I mean I I
3:22:13
really thought that KT would be able to to beat themselves by two zeroing bnk
3:22:20
today that was my official prediction but yeah they lost game too somehow and
3:22:27
now we're back to the regular scheduled programming it is KT beating them over the head with their gigantic wallets and
3:22:34
just looking to push the bottom Lane they got the Aon they got the baron and that is a deadly combo because you've
3:22:40
got all this pushing power which just makes diving that much easier right so that's exactly what they're going to
3:22:46
look to do they're looking for Raptor they do get onto bdd but immediately the Lulu the Lulu Al comes in and bdd finds
3:22:53
a bit of an ALT kind of wonky actually looking pretty good for bnk perfect is
3:22:58
so tanky and so fed at this point in time not the greatest fight here for KT
3:23:03
though duck is going to get excited he's got a couple of kills the penta angle is
3:23:09
alive and well but everybody just going to spread out and avoid him to deny it and he still got the aacon buff
3:23:16
yeah they got fresh teleports coming in They're Not Afraid bdd has rejoined the fry and KT about to take the two zeroes
3:23:25
I know the Nexus has fallen yet but as long as do Dom is standing delay pent doesn't matter yeah no
3:23:32
ah the soldier just Bonks a coli over the head that's the end of that one another double kill for bdd and that'll
3:23:39
be two games one here in the best of three for KT rollster they take it down
3:23:45
they get a victory for group Elder as well and yeah game
3:23:51
two kind of weird but it's okay you go back to the drawing board you you redo your
3:23:57
drafts you know it's Fearless it's new it's bnk they're very aggressive you got CL out shout out to them they made a
3:24:04
very fun series as well bnk I think as the KT in their own right and they will
3:24:10
be the winners tonight the more things change the more they stay the same uh KT somehow is still Their Own Worst Enemy
3:24:15
bnk will go in uh be it successfully or unsuccessfully and the winner of today
3:24:23
going to be both at least for this first series both uh group Elder and KT
3:24:29
perfect I think also having a lovely performance on two Champions that we saw
3:24:34
him perform on very well last year as well both the Renekton and the J
3:24:40
actually doing a lot of heavy lifting is I mean for bnk I think they can still be relatively healthy getting the win there
3:24:47
having that great game number two still for me was probably above what I expected from them let dock down back in
3:24:54
the lck shooting some arrows yeah he uh
3:24:59
he did play The Ash in game one I love we man he's such a good vibe as
3:25:06
well he he's great I I do love we and uh so that says you know every time I come
3:25:13
to wall park they lose basically 0% when rate when I am watching in the studio so
3:25:19
they have broken that which is what she was asking for they have broken that lost
3:25:24
streak and uh yeah not too surprising I I feel like for KT this should be
3:25:30
finnally enough the easiest matchup I think for them out of the teams that they will have to face from group Baron
3:25:37
so we'll see how the rest of this group stage looks for them take a look at some of the fights
3:25:43
that we had definitely the closest game a lot more back and forth there were a couple of key moments diao here I didn't
3:25:50
even notice the first time but actually ended up I think flashing into the Jack Counter Strike moments like that I think
3:25:57
engage as much as I I love that he's going that aggressive another example
3:26:03
here definitely is going to his flash this time okay but I think even if he flash is there I don't think in this
3:26:09
fight I don't really think could change the out cuz again perfect positioning there just wonderful wonder if when they
3:26:16
made that coal uh the teleport was just about to be channeled look at BD's positioning here yeah he is on top of
3:26:21
duck do and he says no and as a
3:26:27
result they don't even get dock Dom even if they did it wouldn't have mattered cuz Rapture does get in the end the BBD
3:26:33
is just churning out damage I got to say though for me way the stand out today
3:26:38
both in the Brom game as well as this even the puppy game I think he was one of the few players that was able to kind
3:26:44
of keep it together but part particularly the combination of being everywhere on the map on the Brom and
3:26:50
then uh looking like you have impacts on the Lulu I think is not an easy Fe I
3:26:56
feel like kind of NE today absolutely um we've seen so many Lulu just kind of sit there and uh be useful but not
3:27:04
obviously as we are of course listening to the coms just very basic stuff you know cousin so glad
3:27:12
cousin BD are reunited yeah yelling together
3:27:20
get him get him get
3:27:26
him great job everyone and yeah just Good Vibes as you
3:27:33
mentioned you know the the bands back together with a couple of those guys and uh feeling very good this gold graph as
3:27:40
you mentioned it was very back and forth we had some close moments early on and then eventually um in one Fell Swoop KT
3:27:47
won a team fight got the baron got Aon and then they just pushed bot and
3:27:52
end of the game it was over because they got both Buffs and we we had a we had a bit of a feeling because with the draft
3:27:59
that KT had as long as they didn't really give up any big leader early on they should be favored but you're really
3:28:05
never quite sure with that team as to whether they're actually going to clean up but they cleaned up very nicely think
3:28:11
play towards that Wing cons especially now that we know the result anded up all working out yeah well let's take a look
3:28:17
at the pom it is going to be bdd not too surprising I like your way
3:28:22
call out I I think that's totally fine but bdd you know excellent game on the Y his air was a little bit more obvious
3:28:28
for me he did also have that Victor game yeah that actually for me was exciting
3:28:35
Factor but the air game was incredible seeing him play air again I think is always uh is always a pleasure and yeah
3:28:42
bdon still hits the same way even in 2025 it really does uh and guys we do
3:28:48
have the interview ready now let's jump down to the stage thank you very much guys this is
3:28:55
year for the P interview translation of 2025 LC CS match number three joined by
3:29:00
bdd on the side of KT roler
3:29:07
congratulations you just won your first match of LC cup and became the player of the match how was playing against BX and
3:29:15
how do you feel it was overall a pretty good one um I think I will have to try even harder for
3:29:21
the next match and with the addition of C lots of fans were excited for the BD
3:29:27
CU reunion so what kind of mid jungle Synergy can we expect from
3:29:32
K I feel like even if it's been a long time since I have played with cuz our
3:29:38
Synergy has been pretty good so I think you can definitely expect a lot from us and you had a clean game three with
3:29:46
your air pick and we had expected nothing less so how would your rate a
3:29:54
lately there are lots of good options in terms of Champions so I think we started seeing
3:30:01
less of a se but I think air is always consistently good and I want to ask about
3:30:09
Victor he's a hot topic for being referred as the Trap pick and you played him in game two so what do you think
3:30:18
you know it actually does did came come off very differently as compared to how
3:30:23
it went in practice so I did struggle a little bit with vior and your next opponent is Hunter
3:30:31
life Esports please show your resolution I believe Han life orts is a
3:30:38
really good team so I'll have to put in even more effort to prepare for the next match
3:30:46
would you like to say anything to uh group Elder to D plusia in the next
3:30:56
match and that's the end of their interview from bdd and back to the space thank
3:31:07
you thank you very much dear aaya as it is group Elder with KT taking themselves
3:31:13
the victory obviously DRX Victorious as well well so 2 to one over group Baron it's a lot of pressure for the two teams
3:31:20
playing later in D+ Kia and T1 T1 obviously on team Baron needs to find
3:31:25
themselves a win Deon here alongside wiid and ox and guys KT did it they got
3:31:32
over the line we're a little worried after the lob sided loss but they bounced back pretty strongly here in game number three yeah it was more Cal
3:31:39
and collected compared to game one and game two and I think that was kind of what KT was looking for but bnk uh
3:31:48
eventually just followed the KT's game plan even though they really need to play aggressive in the all the game
3:31:53
because KT had really good late game team uh Team comp they have Jinx and azir which means you don't need to fight
3:32:00
all the game and then uh KT slows down the game and then that kind of felt
3:32:05
really bad for bnk yeah and they also had the player of the match in bdd who played incredibly here ax yeah I mean I
3:32:14
feel like him picking up the AIA is is something we know him so well for but it kind of served uh such a valuable
3:32:20
purpose in this game because you have the Jinx who obviously in a lot of these uh plays we saw the enemy team saw bnk
3:32:26
FX trying to dive and then you had the azir as like the backup the second carry who was doing a ton of damage and have
3:32:32
that peel yeah let's take a look at some of the votes here that we had for our player of the match and the comments who
3:32:38
did you guys vote for in this one let's see oh yeah both of you guys almost
3:32:43
right side of History here in yeah it was really kind kind of confused to pick up P because it's different compared to
3:32:49
PG because you have to combine all the game plays uh G throughout the whole
3:32:54
games so I feel like bdd kind of showed up stable gamepl uh he didn't really
3:33:00
shake uh maybe we don't talk about the game two but he won a game three like he was really great in general I think yeah
3:33:06
I think the top vote is good as well I was kind of going between top and mid on this one the game one man active performance really solid and the jack
3:33:13
game the ear scame misses are good but I think it was kind of just to pop off his ear from BD swung it um for me in the
3:33:19
end yeah what did you say cold gameplay from cool guy B yeah that's what did I
3:33:26
that's what did comment what what does this mean what did yeah I mean like bdd is such a cool guy you know whenever you see him you you you can't like Escape
3:33:34
smiling you know like he's always cool guy and he's really cold in game though
3:33:39
like he's just stable and not making huge mistakes so that's why I said it
3:33:44
Fox verbally tell what was yours uh well I don't have to there you go Zer and Y
3:33:50
you bread and butter you know um I feel like he these are two Champions already known for the a for a long time last
3:33:56
year's J name was huge you pick those champions from you know he's going to pop off all right let's see what the
3:34:02
Korean commentators had to say about it bdd please said Helios again just always
3:34:08
consistent and has everyone on the back and uh I got you bro that was a good one
3:34:14
there all right uh I think we we have one more yep uh a strong midlaner is like a strong backbone and that is what
3:34:21
bdd is resigning to KT uh at the end of last season and uh an important part of
3:34:27
that Squad a symphony for eyes and ears pdt's first movement Cloud Templar needs
3:34:32
to write a book hold up this writing is fire you know man that's my boy Rob TV
3:34:38
right there hold up Cloud Templar knows how to drop these lines right here again just like bdd was uh dropping the
3:34:44
opponents in that last match let's take a look at the draft you were saying earlier it was so good but it I thought
3:34:51
it would be difficult to play if you're duck D with the Jinx you you're you just don't have anywhere to go when you have
3:34:57
the jar and you got the raan I mean I like uh zyan combo uh especially in the
3:35:02
fist draft it's all about the build up the Synergy right so zaran gives you easy Synergy uh in your team comp but I
3:35:10
don't feel like you really need to pick that up in the early phase of the draft and then that makes uh uh bnk draft
3:35:16
really hard because they need to ban out 2 80 carries but still manage to lose
3:35:21
the laning phase really hard so I think that was the huge difference between KT and bnk that's the thing with this match
3:35:27
up like Lulu can do so much to interrupt like ranage like you can even use the wild growth to stop like his Dash and
3:35:33
you have a lot of defensive tools the lane you going to have pressure and when it comes to fights the only good Target
3:35:38
you have is the Jinx for being KX you're only winning the fight if you take out the Jinx but you know you're diving into
3:35:43
Counter Strike you're diving into a z you diving in a wild growth the burden of execution is just so much higher and
3:35:50
KT just basically have to not run it down and they're fine yeah I mean also uh in the last voice come they said Lulu
3:35:58
was the pick that they were really good on uh the last team cup so it was really
3:36:03
great pick by KT and this is an example of how not to do it cuz I leave the Jinx isolated you can see very split way
3:36:10
moving to assist this jungler which cost the flash from the Jinx and suddenly this really changes Dynamic of how a
3:36:15
fight is going to go uh because you'll see in a couple of seconds Javin can basically just do this and there's just
3:36:21
no counterplay it doesn't help that like the uh Sani in is so far away but if you
3:36:27
have no flash you're not getting out of the cataclysm but despite that KT still kind of turn this around and this is the
3:36:33
power of having that AER as a second carry yeah and also the perfect Flash in was kind of Defending play as well I
3:36:40
think it was really a Savor from KT as well even though they didn't play out really well they still had the pick to
3:36:47
bounce back yeah you could see what diao was thinking it's all right this is our time I need to dish out the damage but
3:36:52
he uses his main defensive ability by dropping the Al and then perfect right
3:36:57
on time getting this done let's see another fight that we had here our second highlight in the mid lane this is
3:37:02
when the game broke open for KT and you know they have a flank angle they even managed to connect this great Al from
3:37:07
the ambassa but the peel from bdd is massive the wild growth comes in after
3:37:12
and in the end we do actually see the Jinx going down down but the damage was already done the health bars are too low
3:37:18
for H bnk fax and the air is just a menace yeah there is too much of HP bar
3:37:24
for the uh KT because also air build up for the tank build uh in some cases
3:37:31
right uh and also you have Lulu uh so everything was really good for the KT
3:37:36
side and also some kind of details just building up the tower uh on the mid lane for the azir passive was kind of small
3:37:42
details from the BTD as well yeah just a couple more things before we put a end on this series as we take a look at
3:37:49
group Elder going up 2 to one over group Baron what did you make of BN K FX here
3:37:55
wasn't so highly regarded coming into it based off of the changes as the guy said on POG State got themselves a win but
3:38:02
the losses looked pretty tough yeah I mean I think with the expectation we
3:38:07
kind of had for them going into this getting a game you know putting up a fight it's a positive cuz I think people
3:38:13
were looking pretty negative at this roster over overall but there's still a lot of work to be done if they want to
3:38:18
get towards the top of that group or have that group win uh and ultimately you know if you win if your group wins
3:38:24
but you're at the bottom of the group you're still going to have to compete for a spot to go further so a lot of work I think is needed all right well in
3:38:31
this next series we got the Battle of D+ and T1 it's the bottle of ketchup shout
3:38:38
outs to the Tomato Jersey for T1 or a bunch of models that's right jiu right here who will win we'll find out after
3:38:45

3:51:55
this this is the coil before the

3:52:09
like the ivory serpent I don't back down when it comes to family
3:52:16
you pick a fight with them you pick a fight with me Hometown hero coming
3:52:24
through mom's fought for me since I was born it's my turn
3:52:43

3:54:22
crowns they can hide slow when I'm coming in with
3:54:28
fire I never lose a fire
3:56:41
my hello and welcome back to to the 2025 lck cup we are here in day number two
3:56:48
and in series number two where we have T1 up against D plus Kia this match
3:56:54
should go the distance we're thinking actually um DK very strong they have a
3:56:59
strong rookie coming up in Shu as well very interesting roster up against T1 with their own interesting roster with
3:57:05
Doran added to the Top Lane so far we have gone nine out of nine games I would
3:57:11
hate for this series to be where that ends because let's be honest between these two teams
3:57:16
we have the drama of the world's qualifier you know way back when T1
3:57:23
actually ended up losing to DK DK's first win to a team that was ranked higher than them in like I don't know
3:57:28
how many years but it was a lot and then we all know how the story ended DK had a
3:57:33
pretty abhorent world again getting knocked out in the group stage and T1
3:57:38
won the whole thing and are now here with a new lineup as well as uh tomato
3:57:45
memes which I do really appreciate I think because of the color of the jacket uh yeah which I already saw a lot of fan
3:57:51
signs of that and for DK they have also revamped their roster in a much
3:57:58
more all encompassing way because Barrel's back and we have gotten Shi
3:58:06
called up but first this is uh unfortunately for Doran mostly because
3:58:11
of Za's left the most talked about move of the offseason the world champion roster that have been together since the
3:58:16
start of 2022 and arguably even for 2021
3:58:22
with the 10- men Shenanigans is no more Doran has come in Z has gone to Han life
3:58:27
that match between those two teams at some whenever that's going to happen it's going to go real hard yeah first we
3:58:34
have the League of Legends then we have the fist fights as well let's let's just add some extra you know woo bonus games
3:58:40
to it I I'd love to see it uh so the big here is that okay lucid and showmaker
3:58:46
they stick together aiming still with the team Barrel has rejoined with D+ and
3:58:54
shiu I'll let you talk about this guy yeah uh shiu in the short time he was in
3:58:59
Challengers and coming in after fenos who again was insane already making a
3:59:05
huge name for himself he's big and we have a lot to say but he also did an interview so let's listen to that
3:59:13
now for
4:00:04
great to hear from sh he wants to play up against Z the guy who has learned he has learned a lot from unfortunately
4:00:10
that won't happen tonight but uh should happen
4:00:16
eventually uh as they are on opposite uh opposite groups but here are the two teams going ahead to
4:00:23
tonight and shiu looking nervous Lucid now in his second year showmaker still
4:00:29
on DK will be there for theer finally joined Again by barl the man that has
4:00:34
been there when he won worldon on the other side T1 it is four out of the five
4:00:40
two time World Champions owner and Lucid sharing bit of a smile there where K
4:00:46
barel obviously also have a history and we didn't even mention the fact that bangi and pumu are
4:00:53
now is just ducking on the rest of his team are on DK they are now part of the
4:00:59
coaching staff and we'll have to see even adding an even bigger layer as T1
4:01:05
their domestic performance in 20124 started off strong and ended
4:01:10
pretty lackl tpet man what an end to the year that they have and I did this for Diablo as well I'm going to do it for
4:01:16
shio as well here are some movies that are older than shio is Batman Begins which you know I'm personally a
4:01:24
big fan didn't see that one don't know War of the Worlds Madagascar I saw War of the Worlds okay
4:01:31
Madagascar uh and Sin City all older than shu is I I maybe too many comic
4:01:38
book movies for you there that lineup Thor playing domestic a player that I
4:01:45
think all of us have sung the Praises of many a time in the last couple of years for good reason he has been at worst top
4:01:52
three for as long as I can remember uh it's been a it's been a long time and
4:02:00
she a loud Applause as well for his real debut is we can see some nerves as there
4:02:05
should be yeah I I do feel like he is one of the players unfortunately that shows it a bit more than some of the
4:02:11
others that are also just as nervous if not more nervous than he is right now it's just the way it is your first time
4:02:18
in law Park he played actually in um the season opening event uh looked pretty
4:02:24
good there but and now now's the real deal you know you sit down you're facing up against T1 kind of the the the most
4:02:32
famous Squad here at the lck it's it's a lot to handle for a very young player
4:02:38
it's it's it's probably the most famous Squad in the world uh thanks to that man
4:02:43
and the fact that they've been together for such a long time now and last year DK had basically two modes it was
4:02:49
showmaker and Lucid go crazy in the 2v2 OR aiming please carry us please aiming
4:02:56
please please don't in uh yeah please don't just carry us this time forward just cash just just cash in uh in a good
4:03:03
way which he did cuz he won the Ori uh what the gold King Bank award very
4:03:09
prestigious award and now reuni or not reunited Barrel back with
4:03:16
DK we'll have to see as I'm getting some great stats here from I I don't know if
4:03:21
it's Jon or yo but in the 2024 CL it's Kion even uh both spring and sum shio
4:03:29
made 79 solo kills 79 yeah and again I want to
4:03:35
reiterate he had such a insane performance that after uh 2023 when both
4:03:41
Lucid was called up p b left uh Bible was called right basically the entire DK roster was revamped and the expectation
4:03:48
was that they were going to be quite mediocre and then they ended up still being insane and I think a large part of
4:03:53
it was that man right there and we'll see here in his first match against T1
4:03:59
and he plays aggressive I don't I wouldn't say Dia aggressive I think that is uh that's that's a league of its own
4:04:05
but still I just don't even know how 79 is possible I remember that Rascal he
4:04:11
got like the top solo killer in lck and that was like it was like 25 or like 22
4:04:17
solo kills is obviously that celsa c is a bit cleaner and we're talking about a
4:04:23
lot cleaner but 79 that's so much anyway let's talk about the draft here a lot of
4:04:29
stuff we've been seeing so far you know scarner on red side makes a lot more sense uh but yeah Karis taken away
4:04:37
sichani getting a look what is this final ban going to be you think about stuff like C
4:04:44
Cante another strong top laner and what will it be for
4:04:53
DK right now seeing uh some fun and okay well we actually are looking it in uh
4:05:01
this is something that we saw a lot of in the last season and thinking about it
4:05:06
I think the thing about nly that makes sense in the current mattera was that most games we've seen is very snowballing but in practice hasn't
4:05:14
really felt like it's panned out and that's because playing the champion requires both your team and you to be in
4:05:21
Peak Performance you can't make any mistakes can't overstep owner seemingly
4:05:26
looking to want to match the farming potential do got to say
4:05:33
N I think Zyra one of the few junglers that does actually outpace her big advant of nly of course that she can do
4:05:38
a lot of damage from range so it doesn't have to be as scared of own or R you want to jump in eventually but don't
4:05:45
have to the ashh lock in though is a complete no-brainer here and I think something T is going to be very happy
4:05:50
with there is the flex potential but most likely is just going to go to Guma not going to be anything too crazy can
4:05:56
go for for a Brum lock in Sani is of course already banned and Zyra I think theoretically
4:06:03
flexed around but that's not what we're expecting maybe DK just dropped the same thing that like we just dropped only
4:06:10
comfort right what's next it's pretty interesting I feel like game one of a Fearless system you kind of want to go a
4:06:17
bit tier listy and try to make like a very strong composition and then as you get deeper you kind of pick the Comfort
4:06:24
but they're kind of flipping it on its head yon or Brum I would get the Brum
4:06:30
specifically cuz oh no it's going to be Leona instead so I think a Brum pick up here would go really hard for
4:06:37
T1 already you are kind of looking to kide back it is carry on br
4:06:44
which uh he does have a tendency to try and do stuff which on Braum you really shouldn't Barrel on his Leona as well we
4:06:50
are really kind of getting a bunch of highlight picks here see what the lock
4:06:56
in is going to be even though it's going to be the Y instead for you're so right though the
4:07:01
Braum goes so hard but I think it's it's yon right Y is also very
4:07:09
strong and uh you know fer is playing it a bunch in summer I'm sure Doran can
4:07:14
play it um I would have really liked to see the Braum personally it's good against all
4:07:20
three Champions on the other side it's great with Ash you've got a great landing phase but uh instead we'll see y
4:07:26
we'll see how this one goes does also take away what showmaker most likely would want to play which is
4:07:33
playing an ad0 mid with the nly so Faker going to play instead Faker Jon is
4:07:39
pretty up and down but also last time we saw Faker in ELC performance wasn't
4:07:44
great ended up obviously really leveling up over the course of Worlds and right now there is the BR
4:07:51
band should come as a no-brainer are they going to ban like Corky here is
4:07:56
what I'm looking towards with the N you don't really need another source of AP and if you want to try and avoid double
4:08:02
AP mid jungle then that would make sense going to be the Jacks instead taken away
4:08:07
so some respect being paid to shiu here immediately and Jack also good with
4:08:13
nearly anything that can provide reliable cc is going to be good it's going to be like reekon trying to think what else they
4:08:19
could go maybe T1 even picks away the Renekton here cuz we already sold the Renekton Zara and I do think that's a
4:08:25
combo that's always going to feel pretty solid that makes sense yeah puppy would
4:08:31
go quite quite hard into Leon as well yeah it's just you know a couple of
4:08:37
bands that really makes sense it's exactly what we were looking at for Cara thing about K as well as his champ pool
4:08:43
is pretty ridiculous so he doesn't have to play that kind of thing he could even play the Zyra you know you were talking
4:08:49
about that before the Zyra could be pretty good in terms of winning the lane but instead probably going to see that
4:08:54
in the jungle you see the rattic glas here hovered and it's going to be swapped to
4:09:00
re okay interesting car's re's fine but with K it does always feel like when he is on
4:09:07
Range supports just feels like he's he's really built different when it comes to engage supports still solid depending on
4:09:14
what form he's in but doesn't always hit the highight of someone like the light that is known for that specific style
4:09:20
and Bessa still open so I think she going to be perfectly happy to pick that up although it could also go to
4:09:26
showmaker and this would yeah that is just a straight up poke comp here
4:09:31
assuming the Jace is going to go mid and it's going to go damage here with Ezreal
4:09:36
NY and the Jace and I kind of like it and in that light the rail does feel a lot better right because if you just
4:09:43
have the Zyra uh you can run into some issues obviously you have the ash Arrow but with the gragas as well not only a
4:09:49
Doran classic but also adding even more dive I'm kind of loving both these comp
4:09:55
Val as we have on one side a comp lot of upfront damage lot of burst and a lot of engage for T1 and then D+ especially if
4:10:02
you can kind of get that Jay nly combo rolling the early objectives should be
4:10:07
really hard for T1 to contest uh got a last second swap I think this makes more sense yeah and I
4:10:15
this also most likely means that's not tank Chase which with this draft I I I
4:10:21
really hope so no he's just going grasp tank J he's going to go grasp but hopefully he does build damage please no
4:10:28
it's uh it's so Tom and bangi yeah doing a
4:10:34
little bow to each other yeah this a it's it's always an
4:10:39
interesting match up when you get DK against T1 um we had that pred at the beginning of the week I I think it was
4:10:45
only Atlas went for DK not just for us but uh even in I think it's totally fair I gave a
4:10:53
lot of thought to it actually I almost win for DK myself because DK is the team that always seems to get upsets over T1
4:11:00
they they always have a really fun back and forth series um fre me I I think you know sh's really got to step it up he
4:11:07
can't play nervous even if he is nervous right if he can fulfill his role and do
4:11:12
his job and actually you know get some solo kills on Doran then you're cooking otherwise I think
4:11:17
T's solidness might just be enough to get them across the line and boy do they
4:11:23
have a solid comp with the gragas in the front for Doran but guys let's do it let's jump on of the rift for game
4:11:28
number one
4:11:45
here we go game number one and already DK are getting into it here they have
4:11:51
tons of poke it is a poke comp as you mentioned before um with NY and Jace and desal oh
4:11:59
he's going phase rush you know what that means vales we are safe for this game yes well I mean no
4:12:07
it's Fearless we're safe for the day oh yeah it's true wo hey we're safe barel
4:12:13
tank Jace semi nightmar on oh god oh this is so barel so Barrel to just
4:12:21
die he's just going to die this is he might get away actually
4:12:27
but aiming is going to have to flash and he's being followed here so even if he doesn't die aiming is going to pay for
4:12:33
his sins which also happens with Barrel um so yeah going a bit too deep and now
4:12:39
you've got aiming with no flash in the bot Lane showmaker getting pretty aggressive here in the mid lane against
4:12:47
Faker but yeah that's a that's a great start for T1 guess what guys you know level one first blood is the same as any
4:12:53
other first Blood that's already a feat of strength for T1 as well on the board W op is the take away from that
4:13:00
one nicely done there by T1 read the play from thek have all
4:13:07
members ready and Ash her level one even with the bra being banned is just so
4:13:12
crazy the slow super obnoxious to BL as we saw aiming unfortunately on the receiving end of that the kill also went
4:13:18
to Gooma and now K and Guma already going to be feeling a lot
4:13:25
better and Lucid was also severely slowed down cuz clearly the idea was there to at least take a camp away not
4:13:32
going to be the case and owner is just merrily clearing through the upside is that looks like uh Doran did have to TP
4:13:40
back to Lane Shu did not and she has used the time very well Doran already
4:13:45
taken a big and again he doesn't have TP so even if they don't die just him being
4:13:51
on the back foot should allow a little bit of breathing room here for DK we'll see the fact that aiming
4:13:58
doesn't have flash available early on azreal is probably the best 8 carry to have that happen he still does have his
4:14:03
Clans that's something at least as it's very straightforward Barrel just gets
4:14:09
spotted on a ward they are clearly not expecting five people to be here and they're down a member because Shi
4:14:15
already was gone they thought that they were going in uh unspotted not going to be the case there are two sums used uh
4:14:22
cuz both Guma and ker flash there but with the baing that Luc took and he was forced to take because of the way that
4:14:29
the early early Ling face played out we'll have to see whether he can actually get anything done and whether
4:14:35
he can punish setup is there with Barrel but he does actually need to make his way over he's now done with his first
4:14:42
full clearing car already out on the map is aiming I mean he is Arcane shifting into
4:14:48
gooa who's got his Q available but it doesn't seem to matter the W lands and aiming just Autos him to death a
4:14:55
straight up solo kill goes to aiming crucially Guma hadn't backed yet because
4:15:01
of when the play happened hadn't actually spent his money and as a result
4:15:08
aiming sees the window D what feels like a full minion wave as well well Luc just
4:15:14
barely doesn't get the steal there was TR that's actually a big deal um I think
4:15:21
that Wast a good amount of time now owner is going to be on his next uh base going to be able to do a full clear already we see if he's able to use that
4:15:28
but man yeah I think he just hits a w order there at the beginning and he just
4:15:34
straight up goes in unfed by the C also has conquerer crucially ends up popping
4:15:41
there at the end and go all ready for that one and he didn't a flash crucially so couldn't use a flash
4:15:47
to dodge like a Mystic shot or anything and now the gold still in favor of T1 they still got defeat but aiming getting
4:15:55
kills on azreal is uh is one of the two pillars of good DK wins yeah it
4:16:01
definitely is I I am very curious to see if that remains you know those pillars how strong they are can they stand
4:16:07
through the years can they stand the test of time always is fun to watch
4:16:13
it's fun to watch showmaker on Jace too uh he is really giving it to Faker here in mid Faker not backing down from The
4:16:21
Challenge obviously pretty good at trading but the Jace they're actually going for a dive in 2025 in my
4:16:29
LK and gu just cleanly flashes away and survives
4:16:36
beautifully eats the the gang without too much issues loci it doesn't hit that
4:16:42
spare he trying to look for something on owner but didn't really want to risk it one more spare hitting though and they
4:16:48
might actually use that and they have mid pry they could play it Barrel Goa no flash Gooma in a lot of trouble here
4:16:53
he's trying to kite it out but there's three members of DK chasing him down and shiu will be given the kill pretty huge
4:17:01
for DK here that's a lot of faith there was a so AP nly on the team that
4:17:06
champion love to snowball but no they give the last hit to the young man in
4:17:11
the Top Lane
4:17:16
Baker it's fine time to go back now he has Flash oh
4:17:22
okay yeah well ice cold as you would expect
4:17:28
but uh he's not having a fun time in mid showmaker actually is doing a great job of winning this Lane this is what I want
4:17:35
out of my DK versus T1 B best this is like I is this the game where it
4:17:41
happens run it R can we wait what's the name again runis runis n there's no way
4:17:48
it's not happen there's not unless unless unless what if we get a 5v5 for
4:17:55
Dragon yeah and aon's going to spawn on the bottom side of the
4:18:00
map would be cool yeah let to see as we take another
4:18:06
look here so Guma with without Flash
4:18:11
especially just you can't walk up like that just yeah I don't know uh maybe he
4:18:18
feels like he can't walk up because sh was going to clip him with the ult anyway and feels like maybe there's a
4:18:25
turn potential there with his two teammates but feels like two unforced errors there back to back for the bot
4:18:33
Lane of T1 and that is with an early kill being given as well meanwhile
4:18:39
towards the top side of the map Doran has just been doing his job which is just take a beating let aiming farm farm
4:18:46
up himself and remain a threat the biggest thing for me though is specifically the
4:18:52
uh the midlane matchup the way that showmaker has been able to have very consistent pryo
4:18:58
throughout most of this early game has been really allowing DK to to pretty
4:19:03
well in terms of map pressure as barel yeah he's going to get in on top
4:19:09
of fer only level four that is going to force the flash here here out of Faker
4:19:14
showmaker just going to hold on to his so now potential to set something up in the
4:19:20
future and now you know you were saying before you know fer could flash away from a shock blast if it was heading his
4:19:27
way but now he yeah yeah make it a bit harder imagine that yeah DK wants to
4:19:33
look towards a dragon from here on out still two minutes away on the second spawn of grubs and first B did go to T1
4:19:39
but the turret pressure definitely going to feel better here I think for
4:19:45
DK yeah definitely should it does feel like all the their lanes are going quite well and Lucid has already had an impact
4:19:54
in this one setting up the play on the bottom side with this pressure letting the spear on the faker forcing him to
4:20:00
back in mid you know Barrel follows up it really feels like they are playing to
4:20:05
make sure that they win as much as possible in this early game funnily enough I feel like barl going as deep as
4:20:10
he did in the jungle was also part of that just didn't aard just really wanted to make they could get some deeps could get the early
4:20:17
game going in their favor because it is really important on the current patch it
4:20:23
it's DK also loves to play this way right even going back to 2020 when they won worlds which was a completely
4:20:30
different lineup although showmaker and Barrel Barrel now back have obviously stuck around but it's important to know
4:20:37
that this is also what they were great at in the past and then they would get a huge lead
4:20:43
and then at one objective or another things would turn to ruin and think that
4:20:50
is that is something as we as we see in this game that's that's the real question for me DK winning an early game
4:20:56
that kind of does feel like power for the course with what we've seen from this team last year especially domestically their worlds obviously was
4:21:01
uh was very lackluster but domestically I think that's where they excelled it was actually closing out games that they
4:21:08
had some issues with we'll see if the reintroduction of barrel is going to help with that or make it worse because
4:21:15
honestly could be beld yeah it's definitely not going to be just the same when you at a player like barrel uh into
4:21:22
the lineup so yeah it's a good point and it does I
4:21:27
feel mean that DK is a bit buffed on on current patch and you know future games
4:21:32
can look very different where they don't just randomly give up first Blood
4:21:38
um they already have that first objective but yeah besides you know a
4:21:43
couple of skirmishes here and there we've been waiting for a bit more action no no runis Aon in this one that's for
4:21:50
sure just three kills as it is decided at 14 minutes which one we will
4:21:58
get Barrel still level five here definitely wants to hit six and might
4:22:03
have a fight on our hands for the second spawn of grubs we are seeing though with Lucid having his uh Leandra is already
4:22:12
done and owner not having his the Poke from the Zar not quite as friending as showmaker it doesn't matter who he's
4:22:18
playing against just pummeling them as she oh here we go going to get that Al on a faker Faker there's nowhere for him
4:22:24
to go as he flashes in front of the alt oh the spear just barely going to go wide looking for the DI you got to be
4:22:32
careful Here Comes theal Al Faker gets away but not UNSC that might just be all
4:22:38
the grubs for the side of DK here as well all six of them unless owner can
4:22:43
say something about it but not looking likely at this point in time I'm glad to report that shi does
4:22:50
not seem like he's playing scared as you uh posited that question earlier vales
4:22:55
for T1 giving up these grubs not going to be the end but it does mean that the pushing power of DK going to be really
4:23:02
obnoxious to play into first turret I think we have three to four plates in bot Lane 5 to four in mid and then 5 to
4:23:09
three in favor of DK towards the top half of the map is Luci o see car there that was a little dicey
4:23:16
but there wasn't anyone around to follow up so K not going to go for anything the one itm spikes done not the
4:23:23
case is Guma might have to use sus here yeah this is a rough Flash Forward from showaker ahead of time gives him the
4:23:30
thumbs up he is sending a message on this Jace tonight he was dominating the
4:23:37
lane now he gets a kill on Guma who's one and three on this asash everything's turning up DK so
4:23:44
far owner going to use all this showing towards the top side of the map as an opportunity as in they go I mean you're
4:23:52
alting in onto Leona she was able to dodge away from that Baker in a lot of
4:23:57
trouble they'll just wait for his soul to turn back there's the stun and Shu picks up his second kill of the night
4:24:05
Luc here car is dead yeah g is dead I mean there's just no way to get away from this one you see he is being
4:24:11
caroused in between the turret and the wall and it really just comes down to who's going to get the kill and it looks
4:24:17
like it will be Lucid who does pick it up bunch of damage goes in but that will be first turret as well given over to D
4:24:24
plus Kia and that is six grups going over first tur blood being taken and now
4:24:30
DK are looking good for those Feats but the solo lanes are getting more and more
4:24:36
fed and loose pick up The Kill as big as well he's the sole AP source itemizing for Mr for T1 not something that you're
4:24:43
necessarily going to want to do anytime soon they do have decent tanks for it Doran most notably as we take a look
4:24:51
here showmaker yeah I mean that melee range that Arrow not really going to do too
4:24:58
much says no flash and you know they always call for it like right before they engage that
4:25:04
they're like I'm going to go for this that's one thing but this Faker doesn't have V
4:25:13
so going in that aggressively here onto Barrel who still has eclipse and After Shock available he just doesn't take any
4:25:19
damage and it's ambessa you're you're never alting because she has 7 million dashes so yeah the Rival of aiming seals
4:25:27
what we already know which is that that Skirmish also going to go the way of DK and now T1 on a pretty substantial
4:25:34
deficit here only one unscathed so far are Doran and owner and then one
4:25:41
objective away for DK but contesting any objective 41 is going to be considerably
4:25:47
harder from here on out because they have great engage yes but actually walking into the jungle to try and get
4:25:54
any vision is going to be tough and playing this poom from behind not something that generally you're going to
4:26:00
be very happy about yeah look see not overextending he's like hey you don't see a lot of T1 I'm just going to take a
4:26:06
good tradeing back away it's good to see this guy is uh he's typed up for a
4:26:13
reason because he he's great at getting solo kills he's very aggressive but he picks and chooses his fights very well I
4:26:19
feel so uh going to do the same there to Faker and now it looks like he is
4:26:25
grouping up to go towards the bottom side of the map we don't have the dragon spawning just yet and with Rift Herald
4:26:32
coming up soon looks like he just wants to go down there with his CP and be ready to set up for that with the seam and pick up the Feats of Strength if
4:26:39
they do get that objective should be the case here and baring that one kill that
4:26:44
they got on aiming because of barrel going in aggressively things have not been looking good for T is uh yeah that
4:26:52
cost did not do the job no no I was I was waiting for to see
4:26:58
if sh is going to follow but I don't think DK wants to do is they want to play towards that final objective that's
4:27:03
another cool down gone aing does now or is getting very
4:27:09
close R to his second item Kuma just now hitting that blade but the turrets are
4:27:15
just again it's six grubs there's a Jace and an Ezreal like these turrets are
4:27:21
going to get shredded like paper and feels like a formality before DK also picks up
4:27:28
Harold I don't even know if that was going to hit him but owner is still dead like he's not getting away from this
4:27:34
Champion the arrow is going to land and they do have a lot of the team over here but the damage is so little so sparse
4:27:40
and shu is just flashing and dashing his way to safety he is just running circles
4:27:47
around T1 right now bar doesn't even die they can't do anything to this
4:27:52
kid meanwhile lucid's just soloing the ri Herald so that's Feats of
4:27:59
Strength and Faker I think he had an inkling about
4:28:05
that but it just it doesn't it doesn't really matter right because you're just losing every lane as team one you try to
4:28:11
make the one player like okay this is it this is our chance and it just goes horrifically wrong yeah and now that
4:28:17
we've seen how the game is played out a lot of the Champions that T1 have
4:28:23
I think are great but particularly for owner and Faker who are obviously
4:28:29
insanely important for how the team functions owner on Zyra even if it is a power pick just doesn't feel like it
4:28:35
does what the team needs owner to do you need him on something well they B the vi because they're playing as but well yeah
4:28:42
something where you can play a lot more proactive as good as Zyra is the biggest
4:28:47
proactive play You're generally going to be able to make is when you outpa someone our first objective force them
4:28:52
to come into you aing hit all three of them yeah by the way no I was pretty dirty so we have
4:29:00
in the past and I'm I'm still going to mention this because it might still happen seen DK throw some games that
4:29:05
felt like that shouldn't have been thrown but from this position every game that we see with the herald coming down
4:29:11
now they should be able to get at least two charg here possibly even the second
4:29:16
turret I don't think there's a lot that T1 can do they're going to be after rely on DK making a huge
4:29:23
mistake yeah I mean you're hoping that you know maybe someone like aiming Arcane shifts in or perhaps you makes a
4:29:30
mistake because he's a rookie uh this is going to be pretty interesting he's going to just he's
4:29:37
getting question marked Pink by his own team or he did himself I'm not sure I mean he runs it towards mid maybe he
4:29:44
gets a charge there well no okay I don't I do know
4:29:51
that that was not intentional um I feel like that's a that's a safe conclusion to droll
4:29:57
so anyway su's having a great game so far and he did look nervous in his interview
4:30:03
and on stage but he's not playing nervous it's one of the big points as we both mentioned it's great to see him be
4:30:10
able to transition very well very early on in his first game it's just the first
4:30:17
game but I think we saw this particularly with kingan who particularly when he's in for and I
4:30:23
think in the LC actually was obviously him and moham were kind of the downfall at Worlds not playing up to their own
4:30:30
standard but kingan outside of that one atrox game in 2022 just wasn't
4:30:36
necessarily the guy that was going to go and put on the carry performance but that's how they won worlds in 2020
4:30:42
uh with nugi and I even if we look at the winners of
4:30:48
Worlds of the last two years which were T1 having a top laner that can go absolutely sicko mode on your opponent
4:30:56
definitely a big win that's set T1 yeah I I'm looking at an Aon uh DK
4:31:04
just running in you know they they're getting close to 10K lead I've seen them throw these F death but outside of that
4:31:10
I think this first game feels like a bit of a bust yeah I mean at this point it's really rough cuz if you're playing a
4:31:17
poke comp and you're behind you know the enemy team has levels on you they start to stack some Mountain dragons you're
4:31:23
really just not going to do much um but from ahead uh yes into a bunch of
4:31:28
squishies that aren't gragas and I guess re who has some
4:31:34
health um you're really just going to be chunking them there's really no way for T1 to ever get close to this
4:31:39
objective uh especially with barrels positioning here there is one nice control ward in this brush but you know
4:31:45
Barrel he's going to challenge that he's got his team behind him as well at least this time still the blue W Used there
4:31:52
Doran trying to get some gold into the good people of T1 is there we
4:31:58
go going to start the objective now but I got to imagine they're looking to turn and we can see them already there not
4:32:04
really going for this yeah you can see for T1 they're like well somebody's got
4:32:09
to do something we have to stop this other wise we're probably just going to lose anyway TP is coming in from Doran
4:32:16
he's got to be The Bodyguard he is level 14 and decently tanky oh they're committing this could be the moment
4:32:21
here's the barrel they got to take out a Leona of all Champs but instead the focus comes down on to aot they take it
4:32:29
and now they've got the respawns coming in and yes you he's going to go in his
4:32:34
respawn everybody on the side of T1 is just flashing away and it was actually Barrel that
4:32:40
respawned the rest of most of them were just sending it you know they got the buff and they were just they were Head
4:32:46
Over Heels going in I'm pretty sure that Shu TP before Aon was down he's like I
4:32:52
it's fine they'll get it I'll I'll area is putting his jacket on yeah no this game is done come on they got the buff
4:32:58
it's all right guys anyway uh go next it's just game one but game one is a
4:33:05
blowout VES yeah sh does he I'm like whenever the buff is up we still have a minute 50 left you're like ah just do it
4:33:12
it's fine yeah I you're not killing this guy anyway um DK they're just going to
4:33:20
send it right down mid they're not a team that's going to rotate towards spot they don't even have a bot wave so not really an option here they want to dive
4:33:27
these turrets at possible Cara looking for the engage he just dies instead Guma is going to cleanse away from this one
4:33:33
as Barrel he does not have the respawn and he's going to go in instead and look
4:33:38
to set up a kill and he's going to live until he dies 2 seconds later he didn't
4:33:45
have the ball he already died Barrel no it's okay see very nice Al very nice
4:33:51
angle there onto owner and DK they've had enough of this game they're putting on their jackets as well figuratively
4:33:58
they won out of this one they want to end T1 here in 23 minutes they don't
4:34:04
have a wave oh they do actually there was like one little minion in there and that might just do it guys Faker left
4:34:11
alone they'd love Yep they're going to take him down the damage is way too much and DK going to stomp T1 in 23 minutes
4:34:20
in game number
4:34:25
one that's the debut game Bel this
4:34:32
woo sh coming up hug here getting the Faith from his team and is Essa uh
4:34:40
basically a Bruiser Cante sure but we've seen some players get a lot more mileage
4:34:46
out of it than others and DK Coming Out Swinging here I can only hope that T1
4:34:52
fights back because again we want to maximize those games I want to go all
4:34:58
the way and the other thing that I really want to highlight here as much as I loved lucid's nly play
4:35:05
showmaker has had very un performance over the last couple of years but that
4:35:11
right there that was vintage that was 100% on and we haven't seen I feel like we haven't seen
4:35:17
that at least not throughout throughout a whole game for a good amount of time yeah I think that's fair and he he
4:35:25
came in here to send a message I feel like DK always do against T1 and see
4:35:31
most damage in the game uh like I said I'll say it again this guy you know
4:35:36
don't be fooled by his his mannerisms you know he looks a little bit nervous no this guy will just stomp you you and
4:35:43
I know a lot of people will come into this and maybe say oh I don't know Doran wasn't able to match to you I don't even think it was about that I think as a
4:35:48
team DK were just much better in this first game and T1 are going to have to go back to the drawing board we're going
4:35:55
to take a break guys and have the space we'll be right back
4:36:27
w
4:37:11
the
4:37:39
nice
4:38:10
nice
4:38:40

4:39:40
for foree

for for
4:42:31
foree
4:42:40
fore for
4:43:36
well team Baron Baron Baron need to turn it around right now through T1 because d plus Kia came to play other than the
4:43:43
first blood and the quick kill that happened aiming but after that it was all D plus Kia and the first game of the
4:43:49
series here D+ and T1 D+ up one Z Deon alongside with did and ox and that yet
4:43:57
again I feel like I'm repeating myself one more time was a very very one-sided game here yeah I mean I was excited to
4:44:04
see D Plus's first game I'm still waiting to see T's first game oh my God it just like started the
4:44:12
the invade obviously went well for them and then it started a little bit rough and then it just went downhill from there and it just felt like they they
4:44:18
really didn't show up but D+ you know there was some thoughts how would the aiming barel bot Lane uh look how would
4:44:23
SE will look at the Top Lane they looked good if this continues if this is consistent level win for a treat yeah I
4:44:29
mean so many random silly mistakes are happening uh all over the time but I
4:44:34
mean it was way too crucial we cannot say it's a small mistakes when it happens three times in a row from Guma
4:44:41
Yushi especially and know I I feel like Gooma is normally one of the more consistent members on T1 and I mean he
4:44:48
was consistently bad in this game um but normally he's he's kind of the rock sometimes when things have then when
4:44:54
there's been struggles for the teams uh and he just really was getting caught out consistent this one this is when we
4:45:00
saw a 2v2 come out uh from Faker and carrier but the ambassa see pal it so
4:45:05
well but also just doing so much damage in these fights while also being such a tank Champion I mean neither of these
4:45:12
Champions Leona andessa are easy to take down yeah I mean some of the viewers are talking about maybe T's draft is not
4:45:18
ideal but when you think about the t's draft they have Ash and Zyra and they really need to rely on their uh early
4:45:25
game uh ear laning phase right uh they need to have the pressure in the early game and then you can sble from that
4:45:32
with the Zyra but they couldn't really do that with this kind of comp because they died so much in the early game yeah
4:45:39
that is one thing that I'll say this game was going to feel quite volatile especially with d plus having this poke
4:45:44
comp with having picks like nly if T1 got ahead they have the tools to engage the setup to really push the pace but
4:45:50
once you fall behind I particularly think the Zyra really struggles into these longrange poke Champions because
4:45:56
ideally you want people to come into you you have the counter engage but if it's like an Ezreal NY and a Jace they'll
4:46:01
just fire skill shots at you for miles away and you'll get poked out and she feels so slow and immobile and Ash is
4:46:07
kind of similar as well you're never really having to come into their effective range until you're finishing them off especially if they get going on
4:46:14
the other side because if you look at all the engage tools that T1 had grouped up D+ have to fight on their terms but
4:46:21
instead they just fell behind and we just constantly getting poked off uh poked and picked off as we take a look
4:46:27
at one of our next highlights here at over at oton and yeah just more the same here yeah I mean I feel like at this
4:46:33
point the the game was very heavily in favor of of D plus it was just I'm cleaning up but they didn't really give
4:46:38
any Windows any opportunities gression com in and kind of stop T1 for to contest and then as arakan secur they
4:46:44
get the revive so it just worked out perfectly yeah and also it was really unsynchronized by T1 as well your Bol
4:46:50
Lane is on the river side and your top side is just just miles away from the
4:46:55
main main qut so it was really weird fight that T1 takes but also uh it was really hard game from the ear game so
4:47:02
yeah and one of the final things we wanted to highlight here is very much at the end of the game you had uh barrel
4:47:09
and the rest of D+ really putting T1 to the screws showing how in sync they were
4:47:14
compared to the world champs yeah this is barrial that we know from the world champion right he always flashes in even
4:47:21
though he has one HP he never goes back he always goes in and this kind of plays
4:47:27
were DK needed you know DK was having great mid lane a great ad carry but they have no tool to go in but burial is
4:47:34
filling up that really well yeah and you know it's not always the best decision but Barrel will always be ready to go in
4:47:40
and here is absolutely was the correct one and I think another big talking point people were looking to see how is
4:47:45
Doren going to look with T1 I mean you can't really put this game on him at all
4:47:50
he can you really like it he he just did his thing in the top this is like the typical Top Lane experience where you
4:47:55
look at the rest of your team and the game is cooked your 5,000 gold behind the enemy team's got a ton of kills and towers and you're like well it was nice
4:48:02
farming against you buddy one half of the biggest move of the off seon we'll see if they're able
4:48:08
to bounce back here in game number two D+ Kia and T1 casters take it
4:48:14
away thank you spacers as yes I love those games where you're just sitting
4:48:19
there you're just farming and then all of a sudden your team has fed a bunch of kills and you're like well I guess we'll
4:48:25
just queue up again and pretend that game didn't happen that was the experience for Doran I'm just hoping we
4:48:31
get kind of a real game it's very nice to see that DK it seems like all of the
4:48:36
new pickups are really working out for them you know zuu played excellently Barrel had some great moments as the
4:48:42
space was pointing out but you got to expect more from T1 you know they're still a strong team I just didn't really
4:48:49
see it at all in that game one and I want to see if they have something better prepared for game two yeah not
4:48:55
going to overreact to just an individual game but if DK actually get up end up
4:49:01
getting a second game that dominant that's uh well even then it's it's DK week one I've fallen for this trap many
4:49:08
times before and I will try not to this time around the for T1 though there are a
4:49:14
bunch of really easily fixable mistakes right felt like they were playing not really respecting the pace that DK play
4:49:21
with DK were very happy to just all in many an opportunity so hopefully T1 will be able to adjust particularly with that
4:49:29
ambessa and JS doing some heavy pummeling in Solo lens and also securing champions for your players where you
4:49:36
have a lot of confidence I think both the fake Rion and the owner Zyra is good as those picks are didn't really feel
4:49:42
like they hit the mark As we are going to continue Banning out some of lucid's
4:49:47
Champions as well as the poppy which is of course a flex between jungle and
4:49:53
support could arguably even play a top as there is the final mandatory ban coming through with the scarner and that
4:50:01
means that the Cante is in fact open here we'll see what sh is going to bring
4:50:07
against that mostly been a lot of answering is well it's not going to be
4:50:12
that that is not allowed see you come on it's Fearless uh Rumble still available
4:50:17
I was thinking also Jack saidani you know if you wanted to just bring out the Synergy right from the first couple of picks on red side but instead yeah just
4:50:25
going to go for the rumble uh obviously still a very top pick and there's that Wukong that we're loving to see nowadays
4:50:32
I I do really like this one two Pi synergize extremely well both as soon as
4:50:38
they're online at level six we going to be able to to do some insane amount of damage in the fights Rumble obviously
4:50:45
can also bully in the lane before that but we have to see what the lane assignments are going to be like Lane swaps are still definitely around now
4:50:53
what is going to be the setup here vars for Guma would make a ton of sense it's been a highly prioritized
4:51:00
pick I'd imagine it have to be LEL vars though because trying to play onit varis into Wukong does not seem like you're
4:51:06
going to be having a great time the Rada though is a really really big pick up here I think that ker looks a lot better
4:51:13
when he's playing range supports and I think that the Rada into Wukong also is going to provide a ton of value barl
4:51:21
adding even more CC on top would make sense showmaker talked about he's just
4:51:28
yeah he's going to looky Corky guys I don't don't don't get your hopes up but what about Katarina chronicler yeah okay
4:51:33
well we knew that was a prank but she was in the nox cinematic she was yeah
4:51:39
and showmaker will uh some fun with it but not actually going to lock it in the corki is also still a flex that is very
4:51:45
important though because aiming is I think one of the few it carriers that's actually played this multiple times even when corki was really just the mid laner
4:51:53
now we're going to I imagine pinch the jungle P nocturn Sani I think would make
4:51:59
sense here as far as the BS go in terms of power picks but we have to
4:52:07
see yeah Barrel talking a lot not a big surprise
4:52:12
um he's got a lot to say I I feel like he always adds a lot to the team uh
4:52:17
outside of his play he is known as one of the Masters of League of Legends Sani
4:52:22
the ban not too difficult there at least is that must be a support at least
4:52:29
yeah because the Wukong is not like the Aurora band makes sense cuz we mentioned Cori can still go to another Lane so
4:52:35
could they could go Aurora mid but at least that is a solo special that we seen come up a little bit no longer
4:52:41
limited to just leean playing that I'm going to come through
4:52:47
here and the ran instead going to be a lot less interesting as that possible
4:52:53
counter pick could have been but does make sense with the combination of that Wukong and the rumble as well able to
4:53:01
set up for those big team fight ultimates yeah absolutely and of course they want to save the final pick for you
4:53:07
know they could Flex a Corky if they really don't like what they see in the mid lane uh against Faker although corki
4:53:13
is pretty much safe against anything um Victor definitely does make sense on this
4:53:19
patch and that will be the choice here for Faker thinking about kha'zix vgo
4:53:25
would be much more down owner's Lane yeah I think the issue with vgo is
4:53:30
that looking you don't really have a vgo composition with the rest of the team like you really want something to play
4:53:35
off of LeBlanc cindra you know these very aggressive setup Champions I don't think any of those make too much sense
4:53:42
it's going to be the zenza to come through instead Zino I think kind of binds this composition together
4:53:49
showmaker having a bit of a giggle oh is it I feel like he's giggling too much
4:53:55
for it to be way into the victory Syra zarth that would make sense I
4:54:04
mean beat him with the long range there you go and now so this pick I feel like yeah
4:54:11
okay you pick it against the Victor in mid okay but with the rest of the comp though yeah okay but I agree I don't
4:54:18
actually think this works into the comp at all but how do they how do they get on top of him like how do they reach
4:54:30
showmaker Cante flank I guess that's that's about it I don't
4:54:37
think they really have great ways to get on top of this this what I assume will
4:54:42
be a big threat if showmaker can maintain a level of play it does kind of fall apart when you look at the rest of the comp because again that's very die
4:54:49
focused very aggressive going to play forward maybe he's just the turret as they're all going in you know he's just
4:54:56
standing in the back what to see there's a lot of discussion between him and barl
4:55:01
I almost feel like Barrel made the pick you know what I mean Barrel's like no no no this is absolutely goated here you
4:55:06
have to pick it like you have a choice way or zerth and he's like Zar bar like smashes the lock in button
4:55:14
the actual discussion was say he's saying you play raon mid and then I play H support come on showmaker get it
4:55:20
together man I don't want to play raan yeah raan mid
4:55:26
win uh AP rant never it's never happening looks pretty normal on the T1
4:55:31
side this side though that yeah that's a zerth in game two of a Fearless trap not
4:55:36
even game three leave it to DK to go for the crazy picks I do think the T1 come this time lot more arounded game two
4:55:43
begins right
4:56:01
now all righty here we go we'll we see First Blood happen at the level one
4:56:08
again probably unlikely although Barrel is going pretty deep into the jungle
4:56:13
they are not on the blue side of the Jungle T1 they went for their own invade got a couple of deep
4:56:19
Wards one in the lane as well they want to see what this Lane swap is going to look like if it will happen and it does
4:56:25
look like it will happen as CK are sending their bot Lane to the Top
4:56:31
Lane see how long sh waits to walk over cuz we have seen that specific w a bunch
4:56:37
of times before we see even T1 actually ping the same location there uh saw a vision ping there there is no vision but
4:56:45
they do not know that still playing accordingly and it makes sense I feel like with Champions
4:56:51
like Victor it always feels like a cold war race for who can have the most range
4:56:57
and outside of way zerif is basically the poster boy of having an infinite
4:57:03
effective range really hard to get on top of him if he positions well for the T1 composition it really is a as a oh
4:57:10
that's not great um but Lucid is also just straight up trying to look for a
4:57:17
level two play here he is quite oh nice gets the bait out there um and the
4:57:24
problem with being Zeno at level two is that you don't actually have access to your best skill in a jeel you don't have
4:57:30
q and then also Wukong has both extra armor and his smash which uh yeah
4:57:35
basically means that you're not winning that one V one and owner does have to
4:57:42
pie out I don't think it's that bad though for owner because he doesn't really waste that much time Lucid actually spends a lot of time walking
4:57:48
back and forth so have to see what the repercussions of this are in the long run but if owner crosses over and then
4:57:55
gets matched and Barrel also rotates things could get a little ugly there is
4:58:00
of course a man Advantage for T1 because they have K and Goa towards the Bots side here but even if Lucid can just
4:58:06
steal a camp like owner unvision they are aware that this is happening are they going to collapse on him they
4:58:11
don't know the Barrel's here just yet owner is not in the brush Barrel's also level one oh they
4:58:17
know and he's just going to kind of run and look at him and he's like yeah I'm
4:58:23
level one raan is he oh he's going to try okay good good scrier there yeah I think
4:58:30
Lucid might still try to steal it and owner's going to pull it out he's
4:58:36
a he's a he's a level down On's level three
4:58:42
so I don't know about this one DK yeah this you're not really getting a whole
4:58:47
lot done and showmaker also backed so yeah okay lot of waiting around just for
4:58:54
T1 to get a very nice Advantage here the reason Lucid isn't level three is
4:58:59
because of that one Raptor he missed so you look as the experience bar it's uh it's very close not actually going to
4:59:06
hit it will hit it now but I don't think you have a lot of kill threed on Doran this early on so probably just going to
4:59:11
continue his full clear ends up being a bit of a even though no actual kills have been found
4:59:18
the ultro early game but definitely favoring T1 here early on as we can
4:59:23
see because with all those Shenanigans happening
4:59:28
um DK mostly just Wast a lot of time not really getting anything
4:59:35
going yeah so definitely going to feel prettyy decent here for T1 but still no First
4:59:41
Blood you know we're we're still very much in the uh origin stage of this game
4:59:48
you know not a whole lot has happened outside of the little jungle Shenanigans Lucy going to get right back into
4:59:54
farming he's going to be down a camp that's just going to happen just based on the way that this is all played out
5:00:00
the lane swap still kind of happened as n comes in K is getting burnt here but
5:00:06
that's a big wave you got to be careful I love Jonah Strong's getting hyped as well but the zoomans pursue he's like is
5:00:13
he going to go for it I think that would have been a little bit too much as we had the very common of course uh Cante
5:00:19
versus Corky Top Lane happening throughout all of this they're actually
5:00:25
fighting right now aiming does he have Valkyrie probably not doesn't um if the Q hits I think he
5:00:34
would have been forced to flash but not going to happen and ocean Drake goes
5:00:39
over to T1 yeah aing was trying to back there so I imagine they were looking for a rotation knowing that the dragon was already
5:00:45
going to be gone but then Doran got the cancel which was what led to that whole sequence and aiming taking a good
5:00:53
beating showmaker not actually being able to
5:00:59
really keep up with Faker and that is I think one of the issues with zerif I feel like he really feels like he
5:01:06
doesn't provide that much early game obviously once you get six he gets a little better cuz you get to impact the map but very reliant on
5:01:13
getting at least a first item maybe once the inevitable sherean show comes out
5:01:20
then he can have early game laning presence but I don't think we're there yet he uh he's not that popular at the
5:01:27
moment so he doesn't get quite the same Buffs um you know maybe if show maker
5:01:33
pops off he gets played a bit more and can push it in that direction this Lane
5:01:38
stayed here framing quite nice as it is pushing into him he's deny denying a lot
5:01:43
of Cs from uh Doran in this case his Lane opponents corki versus Cante um but
5:01:51
yeah all the grubs going to go over to T1 this time objectives really looking a lot better for T1 able to get both a
5:01:57
dragon as well as the first free grubs not a single one found there and Lucid
5:02:03
still playing from behind doesn't have six yet he's not as far behind an experience as he was before so I imagine
5:02:10
him and owner will hit it at around the same time although I think owner with the blue buff being taken might Ding and
5:02:17
loose it just krug's not going to do it he going to have to at least also clear his Raptors might be a window here for T1 if they want to go
5:02:27
aggressive he's making his way up top and do see the ultimate is ready for him Lucid paing away I don't really think
5:02:35
you can dive them though yeah like it's Rumble diving in 202 five as well well
5:02:41
that and and it's it's Rumble if he can just ult the wave and it seems like darl like yeah no
5:02:48
I maybe just covering for a possible gank could also be the angle here it's
5:02:53
not a whole lot happening you know there's not a lot of uh camps right now is okay we're going to have a bit of
5:02:58
damage coming in on Su that's uh more than half his health taken down Lucid is here owner spotted and Sh just holding
5:03:06
on to his Al just in case might use it here but we do have showmaker waking his way up show making his way up nice I
5:03:14
should say um just ready to Al if need be look at the vision control here from T1 and in last game felt like K and
5:03:22
owner were never really on the same page didn't see them link up very different this time around like they've been a lot
5:03:30
more in sync is it's such a barrel thing he just walks in a direct straight line straight into two people in the bush
5:03:36
just happens so often yeah why wouldn't he he doesn't have to be right there's no feros no way he dies everything has
5:03:43
been calculated ahead of time yes he knows he is a
5:03:49
realizer he he's always aware he just sometimes chooses to ignore his better
5:03:55
judgment is is what Atlas would say yeah well he does it percentage based you know he's like the probability chance of
5:04:01
this happening is so low that it it's not going to happen but then it happened that time so he looks really silly and
5:04:06
that happens like once every second game yeah so I guess he's not very good at math then well he's like you know it's a
5:04:12
6040 so it favors me so I'm I'm going to try to take the angle but unfortunately it was the 40% this time all right
5:04:19
unlucky is Barrel that's all he is I did win two World Championships I
5:04:25
don't I don't know unlucky well yeah just during the regular season oh yeah yeah it's different Lucid now has hit
5:04:33
level seven going to get a crabby here as well I'm going be too bad about that one and
5:04:38
I do think we're going to have a actual brawl breakout in about 50 seconds for
5:04:44
either these grubs or the dragon because DK are being put in a very uncomfortable position by T1 because they can't they
5:04:51
can trade and then hope you get first blood but you really don't want to give over the Feats just like that I mean
5:04:57
level six for KH all right he hit the 40% there nice
5:05:03
yeah uh is that every play that now fails a 40er it just wasn't yeah it
5:05:08
wasn't meant to be uh because T1 look at the draw you know can just go for Ida
5:05:13
right they can just and with the top side Vision they have I think you just give up the dragon just play towards the grubs I don't think there's a way for DK
5:05:19
to reliably contest because but DK did play insanely aggro loost like they even
5:05:25
know where Lucid is they have a warden his red bu they are so aware of everything
5:05:31
that's happening even b side look at all these Wards DK doesn't get to play the game and it looks like the Feats or at
5:05:39
least this one one fet as it's just going to get given over they're not going to bother yeah you know
5:05:46
it's it's nice to deny the grubs as well I I don't think they really had a chance to deny it here the flash engage ranata
5:05:54
um shocker does not work out um but I was going to say maybe he got the
5:06:00
flash out of someone but he didn't even kind of it's for Contin cor yeah so yeah
5:06:06
was nice try carer good good effort good effort that was a rumble maybe this shed some light on why the Braum wasn't
5:06:12
picked uh they had had enough of engage Braum yeah so now T1 first feet already
5:06:19
in the pocket going to try their best to secure something else and hoping that as
5:06:25
I say that Barrel doesn't just give up for his blood but we've watched this player for a while so you got to be bit
5:06:30
uh bit careful and this time around no no weird deaths by T1 no disrespect to
5:06:37
the opponent that alone is not going to be enough cuz we get to talk a little bit about the team fights now that the early games played out so
5:06:44
evenly sh going for a trade here Doran
5:06:49
lining that Q3 and she says well you want to you want to drop the gloves let's
5:06:55
go but yeah it's just Top Lane so not much going to matter I'm very curious to
5:07:02
see what's going to happen with the zerth as the game comes along because it is Victor versus zerth they're just
5:07:09
farming now for 12 minutes yeah it's it's the the Zer is
5:07:16
the one thing where I'm I'm not I want to see I want to see the vision but
5:07:21
besides the fact that obviously like you outrange him you provide a lot of uh backup fire as the rest of your team
5:07:27
goes in I guess that makes sense it also means that if you go in and you hit even a
5:07:34
little bit of your damage then showmaker is always going to be able to make sure that there's no people getting out
5:07:39
unscathed and into both the Victor but especially into Rada I think that things
5:07:48
like the Zera are always going to feel amazing because it means that you have a way of playing the game that doesn't
5:07:54
revolve around you diving into the n and they still going to be somewhat forc to again with the rest of the Champions
5:07:59
that they have but I think that particular like both Wukong and raan are quite good at going in baiting out and
5:08:06
then weaving in and out of the fight again uh that's a lot of damage yeah Lucid though is here they're turning
5:08:12
this one around it was a fatal along First Blood given over to lucid and they
5:08:17
want a bit more Barrel get pretty low owner he says this is my kill but Barrel's going to get away meanwhile we
5:08:24
got the bail out here losd looks like he will get the kill and deny the bail can he actually survive too that would be
5:08:31
insane they all survive after that
5:08:36
unbelievable never will 60% that BL all the time vales as not only do they get
5:08:43
the first blood but they get two kills on the Wukong yeah that's Trinity for stun he
5:08:54
is yeah this is getting pretty crazy uh for this huk Kong and as you mentioned
5:09:00
the first blood as well you know you got Mountain Soul on the cards here you get a Fed
5:09:05
jungler you get a chance now they did a lot of damage to that top turret oh did
5:09:11
you if that Harpoon hits yeah the the blue train kit nicely
5:09:16
done there by Faker not trusting and look at the again the amount of vision that's available for T1 hope we get a
5:09:23
replay of that because that that is act this is it's such a good thing they are just
5:09:31
not it's the one pocket where they don't have any Vision at all and the moment gets on top of Victor it's just done
5:09:38
like he didn't even to use his flash right and then here able to get the
5:09:43
flash then the uh the rata W was already
5:09:49
ticking for bailout so he doesn't have to do anything just needs to get
5:09:54
out and DK fans the DK fans are always
5:10:00
always the most passionate um there's been a lot of ups and downs yeah yeah
5:10:06
hey BR was down so yeah yeah yeah uh they're for an upswing if they
5:10:13
get first herb here though uh the first B doesn't really matter it looks like that is going to be the case I mean
5:10:20
they're going to dive dor in here but he is Cante does it matter the damage yes
5:10:25
it is stacking but first turret blood goes to T1 so they get the feat of strength on their
5:10:31
side depends on what happens to Dragon here because I think T1 takes that the boots are strong but if DK then also
5:10:38
answer with give a turet of themselves and get dragon because Doran is there Doran is going to be fine right he's
5:10:43
going to come back up in about 10 seconds has his teleport available so I
5:10:48
I'd say that's still a T1 favorite trade just because of the fact that it opens up
5:10:54
boots and unlike last game I also don't feel like they had
5:11:01
to uh kind of weather the storm against the Poke well kind of play that half
5:11:07
poke half we a lot of spars but the Sol Lane is getting fed it was not just that
5:11:12
this time around they have a lot of Team fighting Power I don't know though DK
5:11:18
they're coming in trying to snipe out Guma here it's not really doing much that equalizer was pretty bad fromc it's
5:11:26
just missing everyone did not did not Inspire much joy and oh change coming in
5:11:32
but will be cleansed off ni little m's bit of damage coming in as he's pulled
5:11:39
towards the guys he's burning got to be careful with that one as now owner in a lot of trouble has to go back in looking
5:11:46
for the reset and he will be taken out but she will go down himself so one for
5:11:52
one but here T1 I mean you get the mountain Drake a bit of of range with the Zer
5:11:59
here they're trying to Siege onto this mid turret and get a bit more as actually maybe even an engage here but
5:12:05
instead it's jante and the engage doesn't happen says
5:12:10
better luck next time yeah that mckill actually I think ends up coming pretty clutch there from Barrel got that first
5:12:17
then that he could cleanse Shu and then K could have definitely used his
5:12:23
Rado earlier I think that could have actually saved owner because they just needed a bit more time to actually get the reset and it is with
5:12:31
zenzo if you can get into a longer fight with your heal on your uh your passive as well as thundered Sky you can really
5:12:38
survive a lot so instead is going to be I think a DK favorite tra if to take another look uh the olds pretty bad here
5:12:45
from DK neither of them really does anything oh he actually hit ker with one tick yeah it's exactly uh and then T1
5:12:55
you got the dragon like they use a bunch of their cool downs and I think they should take it and leave it at that but
5:13:01
that's not the case oh Faker in a bit of trouble he does have ker nearby though as the Wukong doing a decent amount of
5:13:07
damage with the fness he got early on but Faker is going to live and now the rest of T1 comes over the top Barrel
5:13:13
will be taken out in essentially a 4v1 the rest of DK just backed away from
5:13:19
that play so that the reinforcements were there and they wanted none of it and this time T1 That's a classic as
5:13:26
well Faker in a position where it looks like it might be too good to be true
5:13:31
ends up being just that sh definitely still respecting Doran even with dandre
5:13:38
Doran went Spirit vage first so between just that as well as the sustain he gets
5:13:43
particularly when he h got to be uh got to be respectful and Barrel going down 40%
5:13:50
happens to the best of us UNL take another look at started off
5:13:56
with showmaker getting taken wi low help me trade with
5:14:04
this said Baker get
5:14:11
ging there immediate backup from his team showmaker not able to quite get the
5:14:17
damage and by the time Lucid was on top of him he was the only one doing damage there wasn't really any further follow
5:14:22
up couple of orders from aiming for example could have changed it but I think DK made the rle to just let Barrel
5:14:28
go do note we haven't mentioned this really as much T1 might be down a little
5:14:33
bit in Gold but not only do they have the Feats but they are sitting on Mountain Soul point where which
5:14:40
invalidates I think basically everything that DK wants to do I think DK's comp is very reliant on getting that big up
5:14:45
front burst of damage and then play from there and you can argue like play a little bit around the zerif Poke neither
5:14:51
of those things will work uh once Mountain comes through so T1 as long as they play it slow set up for that
5:14:58
objective I think they're looking really good to bring us to a game number three th might be in some trouble here but
5:15:03
even if he ends up going down I don't think it means too much oh sh trying to beat him into this fight d and oh this
5:15:10
time it's a nice equalizer he is burning the whole way through but it's Cante Here Comes
5:15:15
lucid and he kind of messes up the angle Doris just going to maybe run this one
5:15:21
off aiming no not again he's going to flash forward and he's going to bait
5:15:26
Lucid into it Lucid is so dead as eventually he does be taken out as T1
5:15:33
they get a big win in that pick and now they'll look for OT and that's Ador
5:15:39
special right there I thought he was dead clearly DK thought he was dead as
5:15:45
well and the overchase ends up costing them the early as now T1 not only did
5:15:53
they get those K BR sh doesn't have out theodon feels like it might be a done
5:15:59
deal Doran still alive we'll see if showmaker and his buddies can turn the tide but with the Zone control I don't
5:16:06
think that's happening hey I he's going to just have to try to get in there and go for the
5:16:11
seal they are looking to take out Kuma but he's just not that weak and now he's got the buff the rest of T1 thinking
5:16:18
about going in they're just going to back away from this one actually a TP from Baker will be denied so kind of odd
5:16:26
positioning there but he's going to back away and T1 get away with the buff and
5:16:31
we'll look for another push really big win for T1 and yeah DK I was about to say you
5:16:36
got to high tailor to towards that Dragon you cannot give away the mountain Soul Shu doesn't have his TP available
5:16:45
but neither does anyone on T1 have TP the problem now is that even if you win the fight that in of itself not going to
5:16:50
be enough as we take another look at how Doran got to survive cuz it felt like a done deal first gets the reposition and
5:16:57
gets over the wall and then this is kind of insane and just a couple of hit Rockets would have been the end of it
5:17:03
Lucid just as you point out misses up the W he also could have Ed
5:17:09
and then insult to injury gum's old hit aiming uh doesn't immediately get out of
5:17:15
it then the flash W connect and now they might lose soul for that and that would
5:17:21
bring us to I think almost guaranteed game number three vales yeah I'll have to wait and see how
5:17:27
this one does play out it's still at least an even gold state so maybe there's a fight that DK can take Lucid
5:17:33
though spotted on the flank and get the dragon the problem is that you don't actually kill anyone but
5:17:40
there's no TPS I think T1 should just send it I mean you you've got the buff
5:17:46
right you've got the res locid spotted he's aled away he's not able to get in range they don't even commit to this one
5:17:52
DK as y just going to Mel's to slow off and DK back out of that so Mountain Soul
5:17:58
over to T1 no Baron and I mean at least for DK
5:18:03
maybe you can kind of just wait out the timing as faker's just kind of wandering into the jungle is like I will use this
5:18:10
I'm using it guys pleas please take me down I love how DK is just like no uh-uh
5:18:17
not doing it which please get well they still get stuff for taking him down as
5:18:22
long as they don't trade kills I think you still should yeah 100 gold yeah yeah
5:18:29
that's still 100 gold if you don't sure yeah no exactly
5:18:35
yeah instead they'll just wait until it's gone which it should be relatively soon uh
5:18:43
same for the end of the game right that's what you're I don't even believe that this game is is over no because yes
5:18:50
T1 got outon but a lot of times we'll see teams just like win early to mid and then get Aon and just kind of win the
5:18:57
game off of that yeah yeah but I don't care about the Aon I care about the mountain Soul yeah they have Mountain
5:19:02
soul and the zerth is like he's there with a rumble on his team well I did go
5:19:09
blood Letter so that should help yeah but like what's next it's still double
5:19:15
AP into cantti as Spirit vage yeah maybe you a lot of times you can see the
5:19:21
thought process in DK's team fighting it's like we're going to blow up a squishy generally Guma uh sometimes
5:19:28
Faker but well Faker also went for like the abild he's gone for he's beefy cuz
5:19:34
he has he hasn't upgraded them yet but he has the Merk TRS which will have a shield then he Arch angels and Cosmic
5:19:40
drive so he's not and he also has gone resolve tree I forgot the exact runes that he's gotten but got to imagine that
5:19:47
he is going to be off to take down bone plating not a lot in Ling phase that
5:19:53
makes sense so that's one I don't know about the other going to be tough suffice it to
5:19:59
say showmaker going for shadow flame I imagine just void stuff next everyone on DK should prioritize trying to get as
5:20:06
much shred as possible because those resistance are going to be beefed up and
5:20:12
as you're saying game isn't over over but I'm feeling good about a game number
5:20:17
three if you know I wouldn't mind it at all yeah no even this this was a this is more of a thinking game the previous one
5:20:26
was Mayhem this one well I I say thinking mans but then we had that secret of play from DK just now so maybe
5:20:32
not May thinking maname okay who is the thinking man T1
5:20:38
in this case oh that makes sense yeah yeah okay DK not doing a lot of thinking a lot of instinctual
5:20:45
reaction reacting that's the word uh Barrel spots them and then just runs
5:20:54
away you don't need the Z you can just play corki with foron uh T1 going for T1
5:21:01
Baron just going to start it up on vision and say okay come at us and what
5:21:06
are you going to do about it K is getting chunked by this cor key but now with the TP coming in they want to turn
5:21:12
around and run away aiming in a rough spot Lucid goes for the AL but they take T1 off the baron per is still pretty low
5:21:21
but Lucid did use this ultimate ability so did Barrel so still five alss here
5:21:27
for T1 and to be honest I mean they might just start it up again they have total control of this area of the map so
5:21:34
really the onus is on DK to try to check it but they can also keep Trading health bars quote unquote because they
5:21:40
have the shield so you can see as long as you use that going to be really hard to win another TP this time it's
5:21:47
Faker I mean the flanking Victor not as crazy but owner's getting in there he's
5:21:52
really making this happen as now the flanking Victor trying to burst down showmaker and that he will with the help
5:21:59
of gooa they get a couple of kills and Goomba will survive as well and so I guess that flanking Victor was pretty
5:22:05
good after all and lucid
5:22:10
can he even kill Doran he has old oh no Sor old just timed out yeah I I guess he he's got corki
5:22:18
okay that's a nice little pick doran's going to get picked for free yeah if is Cleaver good enough corki is his passive
5:22:24
able to get through him uh that was definitely one of the most proactive
5:22:31
Victor plays I've ever seen do appreciate that tping in flashing over
5:22:37
getting the uh the mega stor and they'll get Baron but who cares they further solidify the gold lead take a
5:22:43
bunch of crucial cool Downs no flash for showmaker sh or for
5:22:49
aiming as a take another look at the replay here and it's owner that actually
5:22:55
this time around able to get the setup that he needs right carry up for already flash then even after showmaker flashes
5:23:02
own still connect Theo gets the knock up and then Doran tanks while Faker blitzes
5:23:07
through it's kind of insane Goa had like two people on him and he was getting peel yes and he had the bail out but he was
5:23:14
still able to kind of have the wherewithal to get the snipe on the
5:23:19
showmaker to finish him off yeah like it was very clear that the comms were clear in fact and everybody was like okay kill
5:23:26
showmaker he's out of position he has no flash so nicely done by Goan Faker there
5:23:31
T1 clearly tighten it up after game number one the only way they lose is if they oh my
5:23:37
God nice equalizer but that's a shinal so not really amounting to Too Much see
5:23:43
now in a really rough spot just totally caught up Barrel as well just joints him he says I won't let you go down a load
5:23:50
Lucid just spinning in the backline as meanwhile Doran is just diving he is gante he's like okay turret changes
5:23:57
whatever and he's going to go down to it actually owner as well in a bit of trouble here ult coming down and
5:24:03
actually he's totally fine the rest of the team T1 does come in and clean his up there's the
5:24:10
ace and T1 feeling pretty good about their situation here looking for Elder as I
5:24:17
was about to say the only way you lose this game if your T1 is lose Elder and they they don't lose it they don't flip
5:24:22
it the amount of burst that comes through there on Barrel absolutely disgusting ends up being enough and then
5:24:29
carry out finds both a great ult to Zone away the damage dealers while also
5:24:34
getting the handshake to put sh in a position but asure saying Barrel so graciously decides well might as well
5:24:42
look for the turnaround the turnaround does not happen uh toaster ofen not hot
5:24:47
enough she unfortunately in this game not nearly as big as it was in the last one and then Doran goes down but who
5:24:53
cares it doesn't matter Elder is going to be picked up I guess they waited as long as possible for the respawn or I
5:25:00
I'm not sure if it was the respawn or if they just want have the buff for as long as possible to guarantee Baron and uh Elder up time but
5:25:10
I don't think we're uh we're going to be seeing anything else as Lucid this is a challenger special he still got it where
5:25:17
you going buddy a year into the lck yeah he tried to go for the HM steel but he's dead well I might not be dead but uh now
5:25:25
he's dead right yeah probably okay least W
5:25:31
but like Dodge well he's getting collapse on he's he's dead no they oh
5:25:36
yeah he's didn't it didn't tell us it's fine doesn't
5:25:43
matter well that should be Exodia here in just a moments for T1 they'll have
5:25:48
Elder and baron as Doran we now have have two separate timelines Bel this because uh
5:25:57
where this is either about to be the funniest story for DK fans about how I did the classic DK thing of stomping
5:26:02
game one doing a weird pick game two and then losing the series yeah or they finally turn that around and for T1 if
5:26:10
they do end up winning it's the classic uh lose game one win the next two yeah or like win game one and then P around
5:26:16
in game two and then win game three yeah like they do both teams do this all the time yeah I I feel like we come into
5:26:23
every new year and we're like new team new players new us no it's exactly the
5:26:28
same oh nothing ever changes there a TP comes in and all
5:26:34
that's left standing is the Nexus and I don't think it's going to be for very long V this yeah at this point Exodia
5:26:43
acquired you've got so much poke with varis and Victor and Curry's just going
5:26:48
to send an Al in knowing that uh they're going to have to stop them on these turrets but they're not going to stop
5:26:54
anything except themselves as Doran uh will go down so they got him
5:26:59
and that's about it that's a gigantic storm and uh e is actually going to be
5:27:06
sniped there as down with go the Nexus it is a Quadra for Guma and there you go
5:27:13
T1 will take down game two six game again vales we are going 12
5:27:20
for 12 not going home early on any of these days as I imagine both the other teams
5:27:28
in group Elder and group Aron are looking at this with fear and ttention
5:27:33
in their hearts because both game number one and game number two I think felt
5:27:39
particularly game number one was up e the blow but even game number two I felt like once DK got kind of stifled in
5:27:44
their early Shenanigans and we saw the the the Zera not really do a whole lot there was the
5:27:50
one moment where they got the kill on owner and fake but outside of that didn't really feel like DK was able to
5:27:56
make much of a mark in this one it's uh it's all going according to
5:28:04
what we may have expected looking at the matchup coming into this one let's take a look at the postgame Faker with the
5:28:09
most damage the zerth quote unquote counter pick save
5:28:15
for R5 for showmaker did not do a whole lot except Flash and die uh maybe next
5:28:23
time we have fold around with the zerth yeah Lucid also not able to have the
5:28:28
impact kind of snowballed from that early one Raptor and then wasted a lot of time never really was able to get
5:28:35
anything besides the one oh that wasn't enough turn to get and and Hey Doran baited them in again yeah very
5:28:42
nice well guys we are going to take a break and have the space we'll be right back for game three
5:29:08
he
5:30:06

number two of the lck as the world Champs tie it back on up here against D+
5:35:19
one:1 T1 battling back degon here in the space alongside wiid and ox and
5:35:25
gentlemen it was looking dire at the beginning with some big plays from Barrel but they battle back D T1 and
5:35:33
they convincingly closed this one out yeah I think a big story if it was kind of the objective control that T1 really
5:35:39
maintains so even though they ended up losing out in the first blood still had uh the Feats of Strength unlock and also
5:35:45
getting the mountain so really just solidify their lock in the game and also Doran saves the day for the T1 once
5:35:51
again and I mean for the first game maybe it was really harsh on him like you really cannot blame him on him and
5:35:58
this kind of game like he proves him and I think it was kind of a hero moment for
5:36:04
the T1 honestly I think it took a lot of the pressure off of him with game number one it's like look my my teammates are
5:36:09
the one that are making the plays here where everyone already got the ins out of the way so you know fresh slate let's
5:36:15
take a look at some of the highlights here as in the mid lane early on in this game it's a big big play by the D+
5:36:22
jungler and from Barrel as well I think this is the DK uh kind of fight that
5:36:28
they were looking for Wukong and rakan just jumps in and zeras is shooting all over again and I think that was again
5:36:35
synchronized really well synchronized play by a jungle and support especially baril once again living with one HP and
5:36:43
save the day again I mean Luci it just the decision making the flash over to W straight after uh just played about as
5:36:50
well as you could expect to uh and really find the EDG in that skish yeah that type of play can be deflating
5:36:55
especially how close those health bars were to being it's a tilter it is absolutely a tilter but you know what
5:37:01
else is a tilter when you chase after someone that you feel you had dead to rights and then you end up dying your
5:37:08
and at at the very onset of this play we're like oh here comes the door in play and I feel like he plays this perfectly like gets the flash over the
5:37:14
wall the long flash Dodges away from the big one here and then Jukes Lucid just a
5:37:20
little bit here thinking he's going to go the other way and it also gets a damage reduction here to block the burst
5:37:26
from aiming anything played differently and he would have gone down and although aiming gets out again this is actually
5:37:31
the game-winning Play Because Lucid dies and they go straight to attan after this for sure man and also your Eddie Cary
5:37:38
lost all the Summoner spells and that kind of accelerate the game for T1 I mean before that I think DK played
5:37:44
really well around the pressure and the the map rotation but after that T1 kind of snowballed the game really well oh
5:37:50
yeah the T1 fans here in law Park have been waiting for the DOR and play when they showed him on the screen at the
5:37:56
very beginning after the walkouts all the fans were cheering and after that play it really turned around the
5:38:02
momentum for T1 as we take a look at this draft you guys had some issues with how this one played out here for plus
5:38:07
yeah I mentioned that I like ukong and rakan and zerat it does make sense with Rumble as well because you just jump in
5:38:14
uh you doesn't you don't care about your teammate's position you just jump in and they can just shoot their ability from
5:38:19
miles away but uh I think corki is kind of uh out from their team comp because
5:38:25
you want a strong Lane but you have rakan as your support which is weakest laning phase and also in the team fight
5:38:32
your role is kind of off uh from the other Champions yeah it felt like one thing to me is that the composition of
5:38:38
D+ is is quite bursty but lacks a bit of DPS that immediate impact but you're playing this like a zzza who can block a
5:38:44
lot of damage as can Cante the Rada can really just cause an issue when you trying to connect on that so if they're
5:38:50
not immediately taking out targets like the Victor and the varis they're going to have difficulty and then it was a mountaina and T1 had all the Drake
5:38:56
stacked up and I think they just as soon as they lost that kill pressure the comp just looked so lifeless well did I I I
5:39:04
want to ask you here with D+ and the way that they've played and the success that they had who do you draft around here as
5:39:11
we can see some of the Fearless Champs that have been taken away so far uh I feel like uh they're still really good
5:39:17
with the jungle support playing together so uh I want more uh Rock and steady
5:39:24
support rather than rakan because rakan is kind of feeling weak right now you're just so weak in the lane and also after
5:39:31
the landing phase uh rakan got a lot of change changes uh you cannot really
5:39:36
insta engage on enemy Champions so I feel like barel need more some kind of flashy
5:39:42
Champions like Leona but Leona is gun so maybe Nautilus can help them to proceed
5:39:48
the game phase I think like having a strong engaged Duo like the Wukong raan makes sense but I think I would love to
5:39:54
see them pair aiming with a pick that that just uh sort of helps out with that
5:39:59
cuz we've seen him really pop off and things like the zeri like the Kaiser these big carry Champions where you're
5:40:04
cleaning up the fight and I think corki just it doesn't really fit how I think of aiming as a player and I think if you
5:40:10
play around him we saw it all last year what a team can do when they play around aiming T1 and D+ doing battle here and I
5:40:17
think it's a good time to remind everyone back at home if you want to show your fandom right now you have the
5:40:22
opportunity to subscribe to the lck channel and fly those flags they're
5:40:28
animated get the T1 red up get the black of D plus Kia who will take it let's
5:40:33
find out as we send it back on over to our casters and I ask you real quick crony uh how do you feel young rookie
5:40:40
Shu has been doing so far while he was awate in game one game
5:40:47
two not not not necessarily quite as great but hey that's okay as long as he
5:40:54
pulls it back for game number three I would like to see him have a great performance on the champion that isn't Cante and ambessa cuz I feel like those
5:41:01
will always just kind of take away from your shine if you do well on them because of what they do and they stand
5:41:08
for and how many fans feel about them as game number three and
5:41:13
casters yeah just just just a lot of and showmaker personally I I haven't seen
5:41:19
his a bestn yet but the Cante one is is a classic yeah it's hard to outo the
5:41:24
gante one how deep do the champion pools go well we do know you know on the side
5:41:30
of T1 you think about fak rink area for me specifically those are the two players that I think can really dig deep
5:41:36
and pull out some cool picks and still be quite good at them on the side of D+
5:41:41
I think showmaker absolutely could do it I'm a little bit worried for lcid you know how deep does it go he looked
5:41:47
fantastic on the Wukong but now that's gone shiu you know he one of the newer
5:41:53
guys up here he's played a decent amount of fearless though in Challenger league so he's got that behind him that's the
5:42:00
one thing sh as you're pointing out Challengers already had Fearless throughout the entirety of last year
5:42:07
probably going to stick with the maai and vians at least anything else remains
5:42:13
to be seen scarner also has to basically still be taken out of Sani yeah Sani I
5:42:20
think we saw did see Sani make it through to what second rotation uh last time around I wouldn't be too surprised
5:42:27
if that's the case ad G is already getting pinched here and aiming does play a certain yo uh which we did see T1
5:42:35
pick up Z at some point throughout summer but I do remember that it took them like weeks to kind of be okay with
5:42:41
it and it still didn't really feel like the type of style that they'd like to play showmaker as you point out with his
5:42:47
champion pool should also always be able to play an 0 mid this is the man that
5:42:52
played what like mid Renekton uh a pretty considerable amount back 2021 as Aurora also going to taken
5:42:59
away scarner still up Vai also still up so maybe they'll trade I don't think you
5:43:06
should give over to scarner but then they do get the vi forona who also is exceptional at the champion cuz now it's
5:43:13
only going to be one of the two that can be taken away here and I would have to say that scarner needs to be removed cuz
5:43:19
that champion is just kind of insane right now yeah feels like DK has set
5:43:25
themselves up pretty well because you have to ban the scarner you don't really
5:43:31
want to take V and give them scarner right so you kind of left between a rock
5:43:36
and a hard place you have to give them bu and that is exactly what happens here so bu first pick for Lucid that you're
5:43:43
already in a great spot regardless of what the the rest of the draft looks like and let's see what T1 have prepared
5:43:51
in response uh the nocturn available this
5:43:56
time we saw it B second rotation and also in the first
5:44:01
series of today in game three just to try to deny like a Orie knockturn comp
5:44:07
which we did see yesterday could be a consideration but with poppy locked
5:44:13
in looks like maybe not o that's That's a classic poppy could obviously still be flexed to
5:44:20
free rolls but most likely with the air as well we've seen that combo withon you're able to slam people into the
5:44:26
poppy wall poppy is also a very threatening early game Champion so you
5:44:32
got to respect I do think that Poppy jungle did take a bit of a hit because of how much harder it is to die one of
5:44:37
the biggest strengths that the champion has is that you can walk up to any Lane particularly early on or used to be able
5:44:44
to at least and just make sure that you stun lock them into the turret fire up
5:44:49
the burst that is a classic it's something that we I don't think we've seen Ari yet I mean we haven't we're on
5:44:57
day two but we are already 11 gam deep yeah so it is uh something that makes a
5:45:04
lot of sense I was kind of expecting to go for five LeBlanc though cuz showmaker still gets LeBlanc bands like it's
5:45:10
nothing that is a pick that I am very wary to trust aiming on because aiming
5:45:18
as ORS already highlighted as well can pull out some absolutely insane carry performances but on Champions with
5:45:25
no escapes has been known to get caught every now and then she's got the
5:45:31
Chompers not yeah um yeah even aiming didn't look very confident in aiming to
5:45:39
play through JS after that lock in um they're going to ban just a bunch more ad carries but like what you ban what
5:45:46
like Caitlyn Draven yeah and also if you're picking just Jinx like uh part of the reason why
5:45:55
you want to play Jinx is with something some kind of enchanter that can really play well alongside of it but now to you
5:46:00
wouldn't get an opportunity to potentially take away the Lulu I hope they do yeah I I think a Lulu band would
5:46:06
feel cuz already you know the one that's going to engage on thek is going to be Lucid with
5:46:11
thei so being able to deny him the cuz the Lulu is so nuts here it's really
5:46:17
good to counteract big plays from either the azir or the Jacks it allows you to
5:46:22
even use it aggressively on Lucid when he goes in with his ultimate or most obviously he can just use it to keep
5:46:28
aiming safe as the Zia going to get takeen away instead so maybe Zia Caitlyn Zia and
5:46:36
then Guma might lock Draven but he can swap so you don't necessarily have to be in that lane not 100% sure but we will see
5:46:44
I mean Goa is a great Z I just don't think especially with ran not being able to be played that it deserves a ban here
5:46:52
no also Z has just been n like playing Z into J get it into VI but into Jinx I
5:46:58
don't think you going to be too set as there is the Lulu B do want to know that one of the best answers into the Jacks which is gragas has already been played
5:47:05
so he no longer available during pilot that himself in game number one so sha
5:47:10
won't be able to go towards that as a possible counter here so what he's going to pick there's not actually that much
5:47:16
left yeah not a lot of meta stuff nar's Gone gragas Gone Cante gone Rumble gone
5:47:23
and besta Sani there's the S ban
5:47:29
finally yeah they're they're not 100% sure where this poppy is going to go and you want to deny the Sani Jax insanely
5:47:35
strong to 2v2 towards the top side of the map yeah Jin I can't believe we haven't
5:47:41
talked about it yet but both Jin or zigs would make sense I like the Gin more when you already have the azir looks
5:47:48
like that is going to be the lock in here it's a T1 classic we've seen them pull this out many a
5:47:54
Time see if it's going to work out here as well yeah I think it offers you a
5:48:00
little bit more flexibility as well because you can pair a decent amount of stuff with the Jin and you can see
5:48:07
exactly what this bottom Lane is going to look like for DK as Sion the choice for shiu and it's
5:48:14
Braum for Barrel I like Braum I don't like this team comp
5:48:21
though I got to say yeah I mean cuz you have you have a you have
5:48:27
part dive part peel back that sign provides a little bit of
5:48:33
space as Bard makes a ton of sense I feel Bard's
5:48:39
really good into the Jinx specifically because she doesn't have a easy way to get out of the ultimate outside of the
5:48:46
flash I think T1 is going to be feeling amazing like these are basically full Comfort across the
5:48:52
board the composition has a good spread of damage team fighting solid and for DK
5:48:59
it does yet again feel like is it showmaker or Lucid early 2v2 or bust and
5:49:06
I guess aiming can carry but aiming on Jinx I have to see it before I believe it Valas even with the Brom to back them
5:49:12
up even with the front line she will want a tank as well I think T1 is going
5:49:17
to be feeling pretty good with this one yeah I mean you're playing Jinx into
5:49:23
Jax as well I mean there's just not a lot of good options into Jax Bard you already mentioned like aiming has got to
5:49:29
be picture perfect you're also in danger if you don't have flash of getting like a zir aled and stuff there's there's so
5:49:36
many different tools that T1 have on their comp I think they've done a better job here in game three of this Fearless
5:49:44
drafting system so yeah I mean you you've got
5:49:49
decent combos you know you you can kind of protect the carry a little bit and you've got a little bit of proactivity
5:49:55
and you've got a little bit of this but uh they haven't made the best they haven't cooked up the best you know
5:50:02
combo dish I think so very curious to see how it's going to go I think the
5:50:08
poppy is well going to get huge value yeah poppy into Ari and VI yeah that's the dream
5:50:14
scenario VES well we'll see if it plays out after this draft as we hop on the rift for
5:50:20
game number three
5:50:37
all right off we go and well one thing you've got you've got this Braum and
5:50:43
he's very good at level one so they're just going to run into the enemy
5:50:48
jungle and this time probably not going to get first
5:50:53
blooded like we saw in game one L swap to come through does make
5:51:00
sense chinard able to apply a ton of pressure in the 2v2
5:51:06
and Jinx just wants to get to at the very least an item if you really do anything I obviously it'd also much
5:51:12
rather be Aion and here you see as well both top laners are also aware that this
5:51:18
is the standard W placement cuz if Shu gets Dove which again a lot harder than it used to be isan he going to be able
5:51:24
to get the wave we've seen actually T1 CL and uh I think it was hble life as
5:51:30
well pulling out a lot of cion Lane swap strats where you use the Canon and just eventually send him to a death just that
5:51:37
you can maximize the amount of farm
5:51:43
now T1 the one thing I do think they have to be careful about which they do have a tendency to do sometimes is not
5:51:49
to over index too much on early plays cuz that's exactly what DK is going to be looking for as it looks like we will
5:51:56
just have some vertical jungling going on which I would argue benefits DK again
5:52:02
just because of how hard it is to reliably shut down a Scion
5:52:07
let's see honer still going to try but again these noxin turrets a little bit different than they used to it's going
5:52:13
to be a huge stacked wave about to come up actually she also went for shield
5:52:19
level one so not going for the C just trying to get as much experience as
5:52:26
possible yeah I mean he's he's getting a lot of experience he's going to hit level two and let's see if they've got
5:52:34
it can poppy do it in 2020 5 that is a nice stun to stop the que on the wave a
5:52:40
bit of damage comes in owner though not quite able to tank it up but there it is The Flash and the fourth shot from gooa
5:52:47
will get the kill on the hu who as you mentioned before just going to farm up the
5:52:52
wave meanwhile Doran just getting zoned out of his way not going to be taken down but T1 do get first blood and that
5:52:58
first speed of strength Jin killing a tank I never thought I'd see the DL but
5:53:04
does happen sh ends up going going down Doran is oh going to make it back to the
5:53:10
wave yeah got to be feeling really good about that one because there isn't really a dive opportunity here dive
5:53:16
number two good look for another one and I mean he doesn't have Flash
5:53:23
this time right but bit of damage comes in they're not 100% committing just yet
5:53:28
but the q's going to hit two but now that's the que down owner going to eat a turret shot and Canan doesn't really
5:53:34
have a lot of damage to trade back they're just kind ofy they're just kind of playing with the scon underneath this
5:53:40
turret the que is pretty good but it's not good enough Anda picks up a second
5:53:47
kill two kills there for the Jin we saw showmaker in attempted roam but it's not
5:53:52
going to lead to anything and even more they rotated over the butt Lane meaning
5:53:58
that this entire wave in top is going to be lost as well and DK everything
5:54:04
looking a bit disastrous early on t one you need to be a lot more careful as
5:54:10
we can see with the setup here to ensure that you actually take him down starts off with the B stun which sets up for
5:54:15
owner no opportunity for Shi and then that final Auto the chin crit comes
5:54:22
through and then I think here sh is trying to position in a way to both Dodge the damage from the Q on the
5:54:27
ground but also not getting stunned by Bard but unfortunately that Q uses there
5:54:33
it's kind of tough the problem is you can't really go for a full charge Q on until they have aggro because po can
5:54:38
cancel it so easily uh but you want to try and get it done anyway nice flash there from owner GMA just takes the one
5:54:44
shot are going to be at risk now early game looking really good here for T1
5:54:51
although thanks to that rotation it looks like uh took Doran a while to
5:54:56
actually arrive and he is basically even in experience but the plates are in
5:55:02
favor of DK which is why the gold still looks relatively even but the feet go going to T1 still going to be feeling
5:55:08
good about that one yeah I mean they get that first one the first blood and we'll
5:55:13
see if DK maybe can with some of this chip damage on the turrets uh find a way to pick up a first turret feet or if
5:55:22
it's uh just going to be that extra gold on Guma that gets the difference for T1
5:55:28
in some of those early team fights we might see around the grubs and so forth as now we've got top
5:55:34
laners fighting against each other and uh see I I hope he's not feeling too
5:55:40
bad about getting bullied under the turret I the new guy you must have known
5:55:45
what would have happened as long as he locked in s that is kind of resigning to the Fate yeah imagine uh this was 2024
5:55:53
and he was playing against peanut peanut would be there again I think he would have already been
5:55:59
there like four times yeah like peanut always does that to the rookies he's like y got to got to show them the way
5:56:06
it it goes here in the lck the other cost of this is that owner is severely underleveled he's about half a level
5:56:12
down on Lucid so there could be an opportunity to make a play here for DK don't know about lucid just yet but
5:56:20
yeah I think they should just dip just deny the initial grub make sure that they don't get free so they don't get
5:56:27
defeat I'm just going to leave it at that which I think is definitely the right call even with fakeer being available there trying to play into an
5:56:33
Ari at level six it's not really a risk there that you have to take yeah so two on they get that they
5:56:41
get away Doran seems to be doing quite well in this Lane he's been able to trade down to good amount he's got
5:56:49
demolish and he's going to elect not to use it maybe just worried about the wave
5:56:55
being cleared very fast and didn't want to overstay as welcome against the Scion was about to hit level six you
5:57:02
never know what that guy can do speaking of which Lucid up on the top side of the
5:57:08
map here oh found his way in but the problem is the wave is pushing into yeah I think
5:57:14
the back here is a good good call waves pushing into Guma and Kia Guma still has
5:57:19
a sums as well if he doesn't have sums you can maybe go for like a flash Q into Al but not going to be the case here not
5:57:26
really a window now sitting on a very early Bounty could not be further apart from
5:57:33
how his game number one started yeah it's a it's a very different feel
5:57:39
but it is Guma on Jin you know I mentioned kind of Faker and carry as the guys with the the Deep Champion pools
5:57:46
especially because these are just best of Threes now you know we we don't have to dig too deep we don't have to go too
5:57:52
crazy but certainly this is something that Kuma has played many a time and is very comfortable on as we do have the
5:57:58
rout here onto Barrel he is totally caught it might be a third for Gooma instead they'll just give that one to
5:58:04
Faker you know Goa miss the third shot so Pi is like yeah now I deserve it I'll take it down but more importantly than
5:58:11
the pick on a barrel it just means a free dragon here for T1 and they're really stacking up some
5:58:17
of these early wins for their team right now also takes oh that's good actually
5:58:25
oner doesn't have Smite so if that Splash damage could have actually realistically taken it not going to be
5:58:30
the case this also means that again an opportunity to fight is being denied
5:58:35
here for DK think DK wants to try and Skirmish around the particularly Braum Ari and by and they're not already going
5:58:42
to get an opportunity to K realistically in a mid to late game scenario is also just going to get beat up by either of
5:58:48
the side lanes that he's playing into I really wonder I think the problem
5:58:54
with the or is that you feel a lot more susceptible to those Dives but the dive works out anyway and I think or does
5:58:59
provide a lot more reliable values looking for a steal but she going to get spotted here and we'll have to get give
5:59:07
up baker has flash available and luid decides the better of it you I think you
5:59:14
can see the difference between how T1 was playing in game number uh one and game number two and three
5:59:21
it's so much more restraint uh really doesn't feel like it's the same team
5:59:28
playing yeah I mean it can happen you know first game of the season can kind of just go
5:59:34
Ary as car a Down down there at the bottom of the level XP not sure exactly
5:59:41
why we're highlighting that but he does have his alt available so there is that
5:59:47
Barrel just slightly ahead of him in terms of XP so setting up really good
5:59:52
vision coverage here with that invade now they have lucid full top side warded not allowing him as we go back take
5:59:59
another look here so barl is trying to set up for a play towards this Dragon but severely underestimates how many
6:00:05
members of T1 already and particularly these type of really aggressive plays around objectives with the Gen ultimate
6:00:11
we've seen T1 do a million times something that is basically their bread and butter as a result going to be both
6:00:18
that uh First Blood and the first objective First Blood of course secured a lot earlier but the first dragon also
6:00:25
going their way and also denying it to DK and DK they still have the Jinx which
6:00:31
is basically an insurance policy but it does feel like if mid jungle don't get
6:00:37
rolling all your eggs are in the Jinx basket and there's a lot of ways for T1 to shut that down between the Bal
6:00:43
between Faker going for a big swoop owner getting on the back line Doran flanks on the jack so this Skirmish
6:00:49
going to be a big one for DK and I think T1 might also opt to just let it go I
6:00:55
mean Baker still in Top Lane he could TP if they really wanted to take it like
6:01:00
immediately but it does look like they're just going to give this one away DK will pick up five
6:01:06
grubs so at least at least they've got that but they're not the team that has a
6:01:12
Jax in a side lane you know they're they're not the team that has a very powerful Sid laning champ you know AR's
6:01:19
more of like a combo duo with the vi so you got all these grubs but hey not
6:01:26
despite the two kills aiming still up in Gold just sticked over Val the gold King
6:01:33
yeah it was crowned last year I don't know if it's enough but it's
6:01:39
something Baker and Gooma both in an incredible spot imagine Guma should be
6:01:44
getting his collector pretty soon shiu meanwhile has
6:01:50
obviously fallen behind due to the early game shenanigans that T1 was able to
6:01:56
pull off Lan's now done for showmaker as well and we saw
6:02:02
even there in the previous play when they were contesting for the uh grubs she actually walked towards basically
6:02:08
the entrance of the Dragon pit and was just like standing there was like I need to wasn't a contest so no need for him
6:02:15
to rotate over yeah and the vision being secured carry
6:02:22
out with the Deep Ward and let me tell you that extra Health it's annoying
6:02:28
actually much more than you would initially think yeah but he missed the brush well yeah I mean that Ward doesn't
6:02:33
do a lot it was just taken as an opportunity uhoh okay well we're going extremely
6:02:40
deep for this one it still works though it's still RI the question is can they trade back on this is The Flash Al from
6:02:47
owner it's not going to do a whole lot but keeping loose it around Barrel in a rough spot but he's fromom and now per
6:02:54
is going to go down and all of a sudden DK begin to win this fight Doran gets
6:03:00
aled by Shu who comes down a left field essentially and now they're going to get
6:03:06
the first turret how the hell did that work they went to nardia and back and
6:03:14
this play still worked out just kill Baker and force T1 to over
6:03:21
fight I guess I I got to see this replay because owner like flashed the wall he
6:03:27
really wanted to keep them around he flashed the wall he Ed them to try to keep them in place but already Lucid had
6:03:33
flashed away and it was only braw and they're like don't want to kill prom and then they just expend everything to go
6:03:40
way too deep and DK immediately take advantage of it okay so let's let's take another look here
6:03:46
so it's a full Shuffle and then also Flash and yes they kill Faker The Flash
6:03:53
is Big cuz it means Lucid doesn't get slammed into the turret then he also is able to get away but then I want you to
6:03:58
pay attention to this Lucid doesn't actually get threatened by the bar and then Barrel gets the cancel on the Jin
6:04:03
out so Jin is out of the fight carry has way too deep owner wasn't able to join your biggest UT damage Choice which is
6:04:09
Faker died at the beginning of the play and all of a sudden DK P the round they
6:04:16
really do barrel is ecstatic after that one it could not have gone better oh I I
6:04:21
I guess you could have AC them but yeah it was essentially just T1 they do this
6:04:26
thing where it's like okay well you know we're going to trade in some way we really need to trade this one back speak
6:04:32
of trading that's going to be a steal so not a great trade for owner as he will
6:04:38
lose his red buff losing yeah he got away from that uh poal and then K used his alt on him and
6:04:45
then went over the wall and just died so Bard just had zero impact it's like well
6:04:50
that's not what we wanted to use the bar for not not to try to punish the vine that went a bit too deep it's it's to
6:04:56
try to kill the Jinx most likely and to provide a good Lane with the Jin so very
6:05:03
kind of all over the place team fight for T1 and DK were immediately there to pick up the
6:05:09
scraps so now this game has gotten a lot more interesting because you know it kind of felt like T1 they were slowly
6:05:16
but surely winning the early game it looked a little bit like game two you know they're getting all the objectives
6:05:22
uh nice timing there actually but see flash in the wall this guy is insane and you know
6:05:29
with with showmaker coming up nice charm bit of damage in the malignus ticking but okay engage Braum Barrel getting in
6:05:38
the rest of the team joining in DK going crazy what are they doing I don't know
6:05:44
not a lot giving a free turret to Doran question mark um yeah she is indeed uh
6:05:51
kind of crazy that was a that was a sequence of plays but it was all for the greater good if they get a kill there as
6:05:57
well plus the turret I think they're going to be feeling a lot better cuz now they did invest a good amount showmakers
6:06:03
uh TP as well as use Flash but you get the one for one trade
6:06:09
so still not the end of the world and that could have gone a lot better then again I I kind of saw at the beginning
6:06:15
of that play and it really does feel like DK at worst at least are aligned that
6:06:21
going extremely ham is the plan and when you think about we talked about this Jinx in that Classic front to back
6:06:27
composition can also look at it as a reset comp right where as soon as aiming gets an assist the duo BL show and Shu
6:06:36
creates so much space that as long as he gets anything going with the movement speed maybe it can be a bigger impact in
6:06:42
fights than we initially fought because T1 is just going to be the one playing on the back foot and in these few fights has been
6:06:50
the case now Feats are dead even We Are One objective away for either team it's
6:06:56
going to be the dragon in about a minute and I think that that might be where the game ends up not necessarily decided
6:07:02
with how it's been going thus far but uh uh CH Ste on the Chompers there's the
6:07:08
charm Lucid just totally wide on that one and he might get punished for it everybody's flashing away now aiming
6:07:15
nearly getting sniped there with third bullet but he will just barely get away
6:07:21
so now he doesn't have cleanse or Flash against Bard azir and all the threats on the side of
6:07:28
T that that might have ending the side of the game because it looks like they were trying to get the force of at least
6:07:34
the sums out of Guma and instead aiming now doesn't have sums for the upcoming fight again the game in about a minute
6:07:40
either team is going to get Feats it's not really about the Feats but either DK starts stacking dragons or T1 gets Soul
6:07:46
point this early on in the game and aiming not having his sums available especially cuz it looks like he's most
6:07:51
likely going to hit his two item power spike is a really big deal and Guma didn't have to expand anything right the
6:07:57
only thing T1 used there was was old cool Downs which they will all have available back when the fight starts
6:08:03
that's a charm that's a rip car and yeah owner right there to try to punish it Barrel in a bit of trouble but he is
6:08:11
Brom and now Lo it oh if the Q hits I mean you got Rockets flying you press an
6:08:17
R button but Guma still has his flash yeah that's both aiming and showmaker
6:08:24
old now used oh good charm but yeah T1 is taking
6:08:31
control of this pit and this does feel like DK they can choose not to fight here it's not so it's just sole point
6:08:37
but you're still going to be feeling horrible but look at the vision that's being set up here by T1 feel like you can just never approach her if you're DK
6:08:44
entire jungle is lit up still might be able to gain entrance
6:08:51
through the river but they're going to have to get a crazy catch to make this work the zoom in there on both the zap and the charm not going to
6:08:58
connect what about lucid that's a poppy if you pick the right target maybe yeah
6:09:04
and you got to hope that is not ready is is are we just going to have Shield run in is that is that what this is going to
6:09:11
devolve into I could see it Go engage you SS are available owner doesn't have
6:09:16
his ultimate crucially so keeping Lucid out of the pit might be hard dor on the flank does get
6:09:21
spotted all right let's see how it goes Lucid looking for the flash can he get
6:09:27
it yes he will Lucid picks it up denies the dragon now they're turning on a door
6:09:33
in and The Counter Strike can only do so much he gets extremely low and the rocket gets the reset in go aiming he is
6:09:40
chasing them down he's got a front line very nice old here from Baker but it's not enough it will just block the door
6:09:46
aaria it's not long for the world either it is a massacre T1 are just running
6:09:53
away they lose the dragon they lose the Feats of Strength and DK they find the
6:09:58
all the angles everything goes wrong there vales if you get the dragon you give up The
6:10:04
Kills I think you say worth getting soulle Point mountain that's going to feel amazing Against The Upfront burst
6:10:11
of this comp are they going to get oton as well oh my uh they have two TPS
6:10:17
faker's up in five but I don't think he's going to be in time they're going to get that as well yeah and just like that you you were
6:10:24
talking about the the dragon being the game decider it kind of is it kind of is oh
6:10:31
want want to look at this so it's the burst Lucid gets it and then air an initial re-engage with the ble but
6:10:37
that's bramman canion no one can join and then Lucid turns on to Doran and as
6:10:43
soon as aiming gets that old the splash damage he gets excited there's no way that the fight is winable even with fer
6:10:49
nice attempt there on the shuffle Pumas uh unfortunately this is level two so he can't kill the Sion so he's just
6:10:57
standing there sadly let's go let's go go let's go
6:11:06
KH let's go is the message he said that like five times and now they've got the
6:11:11
buff it's got to be a quick turnarounds here with the buff you're going to be looking to dive and you know as you
6:11:17
framed it before ooh that's a denial on the back of owner I think he was aiming for Faker but minute and a
6:11:25
half said before you know just get some resets get a dive
6:11:30
going there's really not much that T1 can do to stop
6:11:37
this uh you know maybe use the ble to buy some time I'm not sure because DK
6:11:42
are just begging T1 to step up to give any angle at all and Barrel's just going
6:11:48
to hold up the door Lucid will get away and not expend his arakan buff I ideally
6:11:55
you just want to get an R off and then if you die it's you know GIS might go for it here I don't know if he gets his
6:12:02
R off though as yeah he's roed and and well yeah okay there's the revive in go
6:12:09
very nice engage actually but the followup is non-existent bit of damage on auma though they got Gooma and that
6:12:14
is the most important part as everybody else just going to maybe go down owner
6:12:20
nearly burning not going to happen so they got Guma now the issue with this is
6:12:26
you know it was good but there's no objective really after getting Guma so
6:12:31
yeah they don't really get anything out of it but there wasn't going to be an objective within the time so yeah let's
6:12:36
try and get some value uh definitely not the best look I feel like teams right
6:12:42
now are really going Mega am and you want to trade like at least two kills
6:12:48
ideally to really feel like this is worth it uh cuz the sums are already down you're not getting a turret you're
6:12:54
not getting any other objective but then again you're going to lose the buff anyway but I'd argue there are scenarios
6:13:00
where it might be better to lose the buff cuz you're still giving over gold like I know it's not nearly as much much
6:13:06
but in this case cuz you got the Guma I'm pretty sure was sitting on a shutdown as well in this case it's
6:13:12
definitely still a worthwhile trade as yeah showmaker has been having a series
6:13:18
eles potential player of the match angle if uh DK eventually win this spawn yeah
6:13:25
it's not over until the Nexus Falls T1 haven't lost an in yet they are still sitting at two dragons so they're
6:13:32
they're going to have a lot of time I think Goa needs to get to a third it though Faker is sitting at a really
6:13:38
strong one two but I don't know if that alone is going to be enough to hold off on The Siege
6:13:46
here if DK do actually start stacking these mountains think can get kind of ugly though I think she was going to be
6:13:54
uh going to be a problem he already has 4K Health out there he he has one
6:14:02
item yeah and they have a Jin they have a Jin they do I know I know that there's also
6:14:09
air there's also Jax but if air and Jax are hitting Canon I don't I I don't think that's where you
6:14:15
want to be in in life yeah at least it does feel like Faker builds and will do
6:14:21
damage oh he's going void as well it looks like next so leandre's void should be he's going to be the guy that's
6:14:26
chewing through it uh looking for Goa here he is going to be caught for now flashes the Poo just gets away from it
6:14:33
entirely loci it you can always rely on this guy and down will go the t180 carry Lucid I just said
6:14:42
we can rely on you please don't just immediately die okay he's just dead and uh showmaker probably did as well there
6:14:49
you go T1 a couple of big picks and baron is about to spawn and so is that
6:14:54
mountain Drake up and available yeah that's soulle point to T1 remember how I said he was
6:15:03
reliable oh d okay never change uh T1 smell a moment of weakness and go in
6:15:11
just to pick on Gooma was great uh but DK can't help but over Chase in this
6:15:17
case Lucid going way to him and this initial play is so nicely done right get
6:15:22
the Y take down Guma flash away showmaker at the ready and this gets you
6:15:28
a second Drake at the nice Soul point and you don't need to do more you don't need to go for owner but then Lucid just
6:15:35
use into the waiting arms of Doran uh really nicely done there as well by the
6:15:40
way from car to ensure that barrel and showmaker can't provide any assistance
6:15:46
and that is now Mountain Soul Point meaning that this game that we we
6:15:51
thought was now finally really swinging between the dragon and then the adakan as
6:15:56
well handum still going BAS
6:16:05
I mean it's really anybody's game from here I I do think that the baron is going to be an
6:16:12
interesting point of contention you know how strong can Doran get as well to really Force his way in those side Lanes
6:16:20
like I'm not sure he can do much against the canion he's never really going to get a kill and ch's never going to
6:16:26
attack him when it comes to hyper carries aiming is doing actually pretty well I don't think that T1 have done a
6:16:32
great job of locking down aiming there was one ble to hit him and now um he's
6:16:38
got to deal with a very fed Sion and he's going to have to blast from yeah
6:16:44
Flash and cleanse from the sign he like just how did he wasn't even
6:16:51
in bot Lane he was running through the T1 jungle looking for the flank the entire that's the only reason drifting
6:16:58
that's the only reason he was in that position at all that's just who does that this guy is a Madman okay TB is
6:17:05
forced this is the moment T1 looking for a collapse oh B going to miss and I think
6:17:13
for DK all you got to do is is find Guma the issue though is if you get Guma like
6:17:18
yeah you got to sums and everything but as you mentioned before it's really Faker and Doran who are kind of the hyper carries in this Cal so you can't
6:17:26
expend everything to get Guma see all the Poke actually being pretty meaningful as that Lu is going in I I I
6:17:35
don't know what she was bringing out in this map but I have not seen this Lucid since spring vales Lucid was talking to
6:17:40
diao before this game he's like how do I how do I do what you did how can I be
6:17:45
that aggressive with the sums still going to be down or the sums are still going to
6:17:51
be down but T1 have bought themselves so much time by picking up that Dragon again the big mistake from Lucid meaning
6:17:57
that there is not going to be an opportunity for DK to set up themselves for soul point this game might go to
6:18:03
distance Baron is still up and I got to be careful saying that because I've said
6:18:09
that before and then there's like a five for zero and the game is over but the game is going to stand with for T1 it's
6:18:16
very straightforward we're getting to the point in the game where the the damage from lucid and showmaker
6:18:22
shouldn't be enough unless someone is really out of position so it's going to come down to K we kill Amy that man is
6:18:27
about to hit his iie about to hit four items has been unchecked this entire game and I think the issue is as you're
6:18:33
saying I'm sure T1 wor like they are not getting any space to get on aiming
6:18:39
because lucid and showmaker and even the Scion are diving so deep onto the enemy backline
6:18:46
yeah and if you trade and aiming as a sumps and your carry ends up going down that fight is going to end up going
6:18:53
the way that you want it to what a game Val this what a series
6:19:00
yeah I'm just really glad that we're getting some very high level action here in game three
6:19:05
at least between two very strong teams I was a little bit worried after game one to be honest that was uh that was weird
6:19:14
T1 lost very unceremoniously DK have been challenged
6:19:20
though since then and we weren't too satisfied with their draft either we we
6:19:25
began to see some angles of how they were able to make it work you know I was saying before that
6:19:31
Gooma doesn't matter too much but if aiming there and he gets a said onuma at least then maybe he can duel with Faker
6:19:38
they're just going to go for their own T1 Baron this is a DK Baron but now
6:19:44
there is Vision no flank this time you imagine the DK is going to be looking for the
6:19:50
turn see how it goes Doran going very far forward into the Braum as oh they
6:19:56
get the lock down there on ad Doran and the front line owners is burst 100 to zero that's Go's doing some nice work
6:20:02
but there is the Al from fer gets it but look at aiming he's totally untouched
6:20:07
the entire time aiming gets the resets goba is alone and he is dead and there
6:20:14
you go TK take a huge fight they're going to they might look for the end it's only Doran alive there is a wave I
6:20:21
don't think that they can but we'll see yeah it looks like they are still contemplating as well CH ended up going
6:20:29
down in that extended fight as well they at the very least we be able to get the inap we'll see if they actually Cho
6:20:34
choing to push on can also and I think should back off get that Dragon looks like that's going to be the case here
6:20:40
instead get the inhib but what a Fight Win there from
6:20:47
DK as we take a look at this one sh able to dodge away the Bold again not really
6:20:53
hitting and then Dorne gets tagged the bra mode is there and it looks like a disaster when he uses his o or his
6:21:00
stopwatch but it doesn't matter there's still enough damage Lucid flashes over the
6:21:05
and aiming crucially does as well aiming stays alive throughout all of it and if the Jinx doesn't die you can't win the
6:21:12
fight they need to get the Jinx and if aiming has Flash and you don't have
6:21:18
control of these objectives like T1 do not there's not a lot of good ways to get his flash really K has got to like
6:21:25
snipe him with this B Al otherwise but it's got to be Faker but if he's got
6:21:31
flash he just flash it but this is still not enough cuz they only get drag like they win the fight yes but it's fre a
6:21:36
gold at 31 minutes not going to be the end of the world the mid inip also not the best inip that you can get
6:21:42
definitely the one lowest in value yeah I feel like they should just
6:21:49
regroup and and look at Baron again I mean yeah the only they would the only real issue is that aiming doesn't have a
6:21:56
flash now so you know obviously fer can still try to shuffle and find an angle
6:22:01
Faker doesn't have his flash for the best angle but yeah that's that's the precarious thing because if K actually
6:22:07
does get n on to aiming and he gets clipped the setup afterwards is
6:22:14
basically impossible to play around Lucid now gets his GA further solidifying that he is just looking to
6:22:21
go in and isolate a single Target cuz all that DK needs is they just need to
6:22:26
get aiming excited even if it's a situation where at eventually they're
6:22:32
able to take him down if he can get enough holds of this is a four and zero Jinx four items now Lord Dums iie all
6:22:39
there Lucid just waiting biting his
6:22:45
time T1 dare I say T1 Baron yeah they're
6:22:51
going to start it I mean they've got a lot of damage with the azir especially they've got Jin very safe positioning
6:22:57
here dpsing literally with his alt Barrel is though here in the front line
6:23:03
and there goes the J and this fight is early from owner it's desperation for T1
6:23:09
down goes the Jacks will T1 get away oh the CH H Faker the max range did they go
6:23:14
too deep though is the question there's the ga though for the vi I think it's enough here for DK they get a couple of
6:23:20
kills they get an excited Jinx and they want this game they want this series
6:23:26
right here right now no one saw it but Atlas but we are on the verge of a DK win oh Barrel the
6:23:34
engage Brom The Flash to Q Goa doesn't even flash or cleanse but
6:23:41
I don't think it matters the Mam's aside it looks like DK they should be able to take it down Goa can't clear the waves
6:23:48
especially not on Jin Cara they take down the vi and that is all they will
6:23:54
get as D plus Kia takes the 2-1 victory over T1
6:24:00
tonight and they get another win here for group Elder feeling pretty good after this gigantic
6:24:12
win you can only imagine Lucid is going to feel a little sheepish after uh he
6:24:17
went way to H and put them in a position that was a bit harder to play out as I'm
6:24:22
I'm kind of at a loss for for pom in this one uh but DK remember it took them
6:24:29
years to finally beat a team higher ranked than them when they were playing against T1 and now in the first match
6:24:37
able to get the win in his debut see you doesn't know what to do he's like I don't know I just
6:24:44
I just play League of Legends he he played fantastically I mean she was great showmaker was great I
6:24:51
wouldn't even mind an Aiming vat I I don't I I probably wouldn't go for him personally
6:24:57
but it's it was a team effort you know game two a little bit wonky you know T1
6:25:03
got a little a little bit too far ahead and uh yeah Shaker's got all of
6:25:09
the uh he's got all of the celebrations
6:25:15
here aiming as well they got to teach sh some celebrations for the future though and
6:25:23
with that team Elder going to take a lead as well as T1 not able to get the win and
6:25:33
this is where the DK win started with a play that by no account I think should
6:25:40
have worked but they made it work anyway bar on the Brum I think also doing an exceptional job in
6:25:46
T1 not looking like the well-oiled machine even in game number two I think we saw a lot more glimpses of that but
6:25:53
in this one even with all the comfort in the world and a couple of great early Dives set up by owner and the bot Lane
6:26:00
the smites weren't quite there and the team fighting from DK just fell so much more crisp as we see the snap engages in
6:26:08
decision making and I couldn't really give him the vote but what a debut from
6:26:13
Shu as well man the man made look can look engaging and outside of of bous
6:26:19
streams that there haven't been a lot of players that been able to do that it's very true I I think he had an excellent
6:26:25
SC game and uh his ambessa game also fantastic so really really got to give
6:26:30
him a big shout out this is a huge stage against team one so many nerves that
6:26:36
goes into this for him but he was still able to play an excellent series he even got Dove a couple of times made to look
6:26:42
a little embarrassed he didn't care he knew what his job
6:26:49
was they're looking for
6:26:56
JA they said don't go over and then immediately Lucid took the portal I'm pretty sure that's what they
6:27:02
said but uh either
6:27:08
way Luc was able to get the 40er and
6:27:15
uh I don't want to focus up he
6:27:20
says I'm going to go in please follow says Barrel please play Slowly the rest of
6:27:28
the team I don't think this DK is going to do a lot of slow playing no sh doesn't
6:27:35
want to focus up he just wants to play these kinds of games that are wild and
6:27:41
crazy L the charm
6:27:47
nice I think Lucid said sorry for something I wouldn't I wonder I wonder
6:27:52
what it could be um yeah well there you showmaker doing the
6:27:59
most okay that makes me I I did end up going for showmaker yeah cuz I think it's Jason I think that's Fair yeah I
6:28:05
there's a lot of good votes this time around what a series and I'm said it's not the best of five can you imagine
6:28:12
we'll have them Fearless we'll have the Fearless best of fives they'll happen here at the 2025 lck cup eventually uh
6:28:20
not during the group stage though but yeah it's it's really cool we've seen a lot of weird stuff already we saw the zerth probably not going to see that
6:28:27
again no that's okay but but we saw it that was cool we saw brand we saw brand
6:28:33
that happened we got to play the match ready who is it going to be this time around it will be aimy who does pick it
6:28:39
up as uh you know I would say his game three he would be be he would be my P
6:28:46
actually no I cuz that's him or Lucid but Lucid inted the one time so like can you really vote for him I think aiming
6:28:52
sinks play was absolutely Flawless yeah it's nothing easy in to play I agree and it's this is for a guy that we've given
6:28:59
a little Fleck for not being able to play these moments he played it really well well you got the interview on stage
6:29:04
ready to go in just a little bit and we are going to be hearing from the man himself uh am curious to see what he has
6:29:10
to say about uh you know even the Ezreal game that he got to play very early on
6:29:17
um yeah I mean there were a lot of choices I I don't think that aiming would have been my P but yeah it's okay
6:29:24
it's fine I'm I'm expecting a a split vote as well which I think is fair there were a lot of moments Luc said bar the
6:29:31
one play had a good one even she would the best at game absolutely well guys we do have the interview on stage let's
6:29:36
throw it to Dear for the translation now thank you very much guys this is for
6:29:44
the P interview translation of 2025 lck cups match number four joined by Amy on
6:29:50
the side of now group Elder has secured their
6:29:59
third how do you feel after defeating T1 starting the LC cup with a victory is
6:30:07
actually such a great thing and I think us having a great contribution to team
6:30:12
group alra is also making me very happy and the reunion with barl and Sh call
6:30:21
many people are excited for D+ Kia so just from your first Cup match you guys display some high
6:30:29
performance yeah I think it went pretty well I think uh on stage we have high
6:30:34
levels of confidence right now and since call up there's been a lot of
6:30:41
expectations for him was he
6:30:51
nervous I
6:30:57
think was actually more nervous today I think she was actually doing
6:31:02
really well and I believe that he will grow to be a even better player so I
6:31:08
will support
6:31:13
you and the blind Pi in game one and thei in game three it feel like you guys
6:31:20
are ready for Fearless draft so what's your impression on Fearless draft and how now that you guys played on stage I
6:31:28
think we have so much to think of when it comes to Fearless tra and I think we
6:31:33
just have to be ready to pick some picks that we are not exactly confident
6:31:40
in or comfortable with with with full of
6:31:46
confidence I think right now with the choices that ad carries get we have
6:31:51
limited mobility and limited choices so it actually makes me think a
6:31:59
lot and what would you like to Showcase in the rest of LC cup
6:32:04
and last season I got the gold King award and it made me really happy so I
6:32:09
think if I were to get another opportunity I want to aim for gold King award
6:32:16
again did shout
6:32:22
out figh you know thinking
6:32:29
about group Elder and group Baron I realized today
6:32:35
in the later half of the game group Elder Elder was actually better than baren so let's go group Elder and that's
6:32:43
the end of the interview with aiming and back to the space thank
6:32:49
you thank you very much dear and that's right based on the score it is let's go
6:32:55
group Elder as they go up 3 to one thanks to D+ Kia's win over T1 here 2
6:33:01
to1 in game number three welcome back to the space gone alongside W did and Ox to close things out here and as we always
6:33:08
do after a series player of the match going to aiming it was a close vote
6:33:14
because it was split all the way across here so I want to get your thoughts on this W did yeah I personally bought it
6:33:19
for buriel because I think uh barel kind of filled up the missing po part of the
6:33:25
DK once again yeah it shows that DK finally found the var's replacement and it's old the varal you know uh we could
6:33:32
see some proactive plays from him and also he's helping uh rukie jungler he's
6:33:37
not rukie anymore but he's still young so it's really good to see him back again yeah I just feel like it's great
6:33:43
to see a the team have such like a driving force you know and really feel like they're not afraid to make plays uh
6:33:48
it feels like it's been a long time since we've had that even when D Plus have been playing well previously I feel
6:33:53
like there's just such a difference when you have a player like baral his experience in the team so really good to see and you know the vote was very split
6:34:00
there was a vote for literally everyone and I think that's Justified I think everyone had their moments in the series with they Sean yeah this was a series
6:34:06
where everyone was pretty I guess it was a close series throughout and we were kind of wondering who was going to going
6:34:12
to step up and make the big play and you could see showmaker getting some shout outs as well from the Korean broadcast
6:34:19
Cloud Templar with an ADC like this I can play tank all day less less poetic this time but straight to the point by
6:34:25
Cloud Templar at the start in the Finish there was the gold Kink that's right aiming the udy bank gold King from last
6:34:31
season already shouted it out in his first in interview uh so aiming getting it started off well here with the player
6:34:38
of the match now let's take a look at some of the highlights here because this one was the closest game of the series
6:34:44
and this fight here at Drake was when it finally started to swing one way and I think it's really hard cuz as soon as
6:34:49
someone goes down on the side of T1 you have so much momentum given over from the vi and the Jinx and it makes fights
6:34:55
really difficult to navigate and you have a Jin who just struggles to cut through so here Guma was hitting the saion not really doing much and as soon
6:35:02
as that first reset comes in the momentum is just so heavily in favor you see Faker tries to make something off it
6:35:08
but his his Shuffle doesn't connect onto the Jinx and it's just clean up time with show getting all those kills I mean
6:35:14
basically DK's team comp is so much better they can tank they can also
6:35:19
engage and also they deal the damage but when you think about the T1 comp you have to some kind of like flank with ja
6:35:26
and looking for super plays with azir but you don't have a front line damage so I feel like their draft was kind of
6:35:32
like off uh compared to DK yeah a little bit harder to execute the vi was kept away from Lucid throughout the series
6:35:39
when he got it he made some plays here then up a big big fight by Baron baited out by D+ and it just once again feels
6:35:45
quite awkward you know they're trying to buy space and then Doren has to use his Z oner goes down and return fer has to
6:35:52
try and find a big Shuffle that's really the only angle they have but we see a great Flash from aiming and again goom
6:35:58
is just trying to deal damage but it takes so long to cut through the scon takes so long to kill form takes so long
6:36:04
for Jin to kill and it's just clean up time once again yeah I mean back in the day we couldn't really uh blame the
6:36:10
coaches uh from the bad band picks but I feel like nowadays you can actually
6:36:16
blame the coaches from the band picks because it's a fear lless I don't think players can take uh the time to think
6:36:22
about the draft a lot so it feels like it's uh all about the coaching staffs and also uh more like how you think
6:36:29
about the team comp but yeah this time around I feel like they just out I mean they were just like really really bad on
6:36:36
the draft uh in the last game yeah I feel like a lot of time in the lck we've had like our core strong picks and the drafts haven't been that varied it's
6:36:42
like okay what picks are good for you what are good for them generally stick to those but with Fearless especially when it's coming to these game threes
6:36:48
we're seeing teams pushed a bit more and some teams when you just look at the comp as a whole you like I don't see the
6:36:53
cohesion I don't see the logic and then some comps it's like that D+ comp just plays itself yeah one fun fact all the
6:37:00
kings from sktt1 wins against t won so maybe uh next time around they can win
6:37:07
but this time around yeah right coach Beni getting the victory there with the plus Kia the new coach on over there
6:37:14
let's take a look at the standings as we finally at the end of the day have a leader in the group battles it is group
6:37:20
Elder with a two day against group Baron as T1 and bnk FX fall against KT and D
6:37:29
plus respectively this put a lot of pressure on H life Esports you know they they have to represent present their group as the one who are the the top
6:37:36
team from group Baron and they'll be going up against gen G and can I really need that win to secure it yeah remember
6:37:41
all the teams in the losing side at best get to play in play-ins and at worst are
6:37:47
knocked out of the lck cup so come on Bros we need we need a couple wins Bros let's let's get ourselves on out of
6:37:53
there as uh we take a look at the matches for tomorrow where it's the big
6:37:58
one the rematch of the lck finals summer split 2024 Hana life Esports and ji do
6:38:07
battle and then the Bros take the rift one more time against Nong shim as we start the second matches final thoughts
6:38:13
here on today where we got to see a lot of debuts by players new faces new places who stood out to you the most
6:38:20
here Ox I think SE had a really good series um I think ultimately like it's not a surprise that DK often start off
6:38:26
well and we've seen all the other players play well but he he kind of just fit in and it didn't seem like there was a notable like oh we have an issue with
6:38:33
playing but we're accommodating it the whole team felt good so it's a good start for him I mean for me it's burial
6:38:39
once again because uh DK was missing one part that they need some proactive and
6:38:45
uh they really need the some kind of engage support has no fear and it's
6:38:50
burial once again and I feel like the DK the team color is always being like so
6:38:55
fun to watch and once again showmaker makes so much difference between uh the
6:39:02
games and barrial showmaker playing together is like always fun to watch now ax in the earlier series KTB and K FX
6:39:09
who stood out for you both good and bad and just moments to build upon here um I
6:39:15
mean honestly I feel like because bdd Duo like bdd had a good series overall
6:39:20
obviously Jing with that uh play of the match but I think with the form bdd was in uh last year at the end of last year
6:39:27
and also cuz generally I really expect great things so you know they won the series it's a good start but losing the
6:39:32
game against BK K Rex I think if this team is going to challenge the top rosters it's going to be that mid jungle Duo so we saw some good L signs for them
6:39:39
but I want to see Excellence SC forwards yeah I'm wondering if someone is going to found the find a solution on VI
6:39:46
because uh a lot of team just banned VI but the T1 tried to open it but it seems
6:39:52
like it's just a broken Champion all right well a lot of debuts have been handed out here in the first two days of
6:39:57
the lck but we've got two teams still left to show what they've got for the first time in the 2025 season Hana life
6:40:04
Esports and gen will have that match for you tomorrow so make sure you don't miss it on behalf of everyone here in the lck
6:40:11
