1:00:06
and Barrel yeah and the we're going to be looking
1:00:11
towards him today expectation is that bnk is definitely the underdog here as mentioned I think particular one two of
1:00:18
bdd and cuz has already shown how insanely strong they are cuz even though
1:00:23
uh as they often do quangong back then now DN freaks was unable to actually
1:00:28
make it that was not because of him he had so many incredible performances throughout the year and Kellen also
1:00:35
ended on a bit of a downswing as we saw last year got replaced by moam somewhere
1:00:40
towards the end of summer didn't end up playing at Worlds which might have benefited him cuz moam did and didn't
1:00:46
leave a very good impression we'll see how he's able to stand up here to wey today because we is
1:00:52
one of the more hyped Prospect I think it was really uh hanok hype and way that
1:00:58
built the initial hype for KT and then one Zin again and that roster really clicked but he's still absolutely
1:01:04
dunking on people got a quick two Z at the beginning of this week with KT as well as an Applause for score
1:01:10
unsurprisingly yeah uh a huge one everybody pretty much and showing some old pictures of him and Ru as well as
1:01:21
um what is that on the left I I don't no
1:01:26
so I thought it I thought it was Hoka for who from Hunter Hunter but I
1:01:31
don't well I don't actually think that was it I just saw the the clown get up but I think it's slightly different so I
1:01:37
don't know about this well we'll leave it to your imagination um I was very excited to see the score and Ru picture
1:01:44
because they're coaching against each other today and now we're going to get into our first round and if you're new
1:01:50
here for the 2025 lck cup and actually around the world we're going Fearless so
1:01:55
so if you pick something you can't play it again for the rest of the series those are the
1:02:01
rules and uh already it has led to some really interesting picks uh in you know
1:02:08
game 3es we had two of those yesterday you were here the entire day I was at home relaxing watching you guys having a
1:02:14
great time watching The League of Legends yeah what you're saying is you didn't get as much of a visceral experience ASAS and again to remind
1:02:22
everyone either team plays a champ it is out the bands don't matter although the
1:02:28
bands often stay kind of the same but a champion is picked by either team and it will no longer be available it'll appear
1:02:34
at the top of your screen when we get to the next round of drafts and we have already seen in the one day that some
1:02:41
teams are a lot better equipped at dealing with this than others because it really changes draft and how you can
1:02:47
Target out specific roles how you need to have a deeper Champion poll and how you need to be a lot more flexible with
1:02:53
both your priority but also with how you build out your compositions uh and thus
1:02:59
far some teams have not really been able to do that we'll see if today is any different yeah I mean in that aspect you
1:03:05
really have to give KT the advantage um you know I I I just think especially in
1:03:10
the mid jungle roles like bdd and cuz they can play like 10 plus different
1:03:16
Champions to maybe their best level right so that's um you know we all know
1:03:21
about BD zir and stuff like that from from older days but he can play so many different things and I think that's
1:03:26
really going to benefit them in that mid jungle Duo as Rumble is the first pick here you don't see the scarner scarner
1:03:33
is really the big one that we see a lot first pick but they ban it on blue side Ash Sani would make a lot of sense here
1:03:39
can even pick up the Braum later on and have both incredible engage the CC that it provides is crazy Sani here and then
1:03:48
yon would I think make the most sense but they might feel like Raptor isn't going to prioritize it cuz obviously is an incredible Sani but he is also pretty
1:03:56
flexible can still go towards some of the more Niche picks we saw the N yesterday I don't think that was a great
1:04:01
spot because is one of the guys that gets to play that champion without us having any doubts and the setup for
1:04:09
being K though clear getting one of his Comer Champions the rumble was the champion that I think he kind of started turning around his general public
1:04:16
opinion on he did have a bit of a slow start last year but ended quite strong
1:04:21
and it was a couple of Rumble performances that I think really cemented that Cor going to get picked up here for Via and I would expect a jungle
1:04:31
pickup as well although the maai is of course a flex could theoretically still go towards Kellen but most likely will
1:04:38
be for Raptor here and providing a ton of lockdown has really dropped in priority I think there was a lot of
1:04:44
games yesterday where we just fell through the draft Yeah uh as you mentioned you know a lot of uh a lot of
1:04:50
uh Flex potential actually um even the corki the Corky as well C8 carry already
1:04:57
and uh even the rumble although we're probably not going to see that Flex thinking about a Zyra here is cuz and
1:05:04
that is going to get locked in so not quite the Sani were expecting but it is
1:05:10
an AP jungler to go along with the O name theoretically could even also be
1:05:15
flexed uh I think ashar does not sound like a good time to play into yeah I don't think it's likely we did actually
1:05:22
see I think one or two zy bents yesterday as well is still a jungler that's very strong in
1:05:28
the same way as there was before incredibly quick cleer can chew for the jungle at a rapid pace and into tank
1:05:33
jungles in particular you get a lot more leeway though not at high of a risk of
1:05:39
getting invaded early on of getting jumped and caught in early skirmishes and the game is very team fight Centric
1:05:45
at the moment if you didn't catch yesterday if you're just watching your favorite teams there are a lot of 5v5 it
1:05:50
feels like the smaller skirmishes have kind of Gone by the wayside and instead that first grub spawn we've had multiple
1:05:56
55s there it's just everything kind of matters a bit more you know uh even a single objective uh a single Aon which
1:06:05
is a huge objective obviously fighting over that you got to group around that just a lot of things to group around so
1:06:11
um I feel like it kind of was the changes that Riot wanted to see and we are seeing that so far the Ezreal also
1:06:17
banned away so really giving credit for the corki in the mid lane and just trying to pick away stuff from diao here
1:06:26
the one downside of the Zyra is that Zyra is a champion that really likes to be played into because she's very
1:06:32
immobile it's really good lockdown lot of AOE damage and these Le old but not really that great when she has to be the
1:06:38
one initiating things and Thea is kind of contrary to that obviously going to be playing a lot more forward more
1:06:45
circles here could be good for KT we saw the Gallo come out yesterday this is a
1:06:51
lot of comfort I also think that it would be good with the Zyra specifically
1:06:57
but I also feel like the Renekton hasn't really felt that strong even though in theory I think it makes sense because
1:07:03
the early fights are really big yeah having a strong presence is definitely a
1:07:09
big bonus this is one of the AR's uh favorites but trying to play kaisa when
1:07:14
there is a lot of AOE damage I think can always feel a little bit ify do got to
1:07:19
say though the bnk draft as a as a as a whole makes a lot of sense a lot of damage a lot of AOE team fighting Power
1:07:26
and yeah we talked about the Bron before I think would make a ton of sense really really strong when you have things like
1:07:33
the kaisa diving into you yeah I mean you're going to be dealing with the kaisa the Leona even
1:07:39
some maybe Les I say it the engage maai um could be happening so the Brum just
1:07:46
feels very comfortable I I think that's a great one to kind of sit around your Ash and uh just feel very nice uh the
1:07:52
Renekton to come out here into the rumble is going to be an interesting matchup we saw that Jace banned away in
1:07:58
the first round of bands on the red side and uh you know with the rumble coming out he just decided to go for that reaon
1:08:05
so definitely curious to see how that one is going to go and Via he looked great on yon in the season opener bdd
1:08:11
steals that one away from him and now via's got to play into it as corki how is that matchup going to look
1:08:17
how is via going to look uh on the real stage this also the question of the bot
1:08:23
Lane because the kaisa I think is in a great spot at the moment but an ash bro Lane that is rough we might actually see
1:08:30
bfx go for a lane swap to try and get out of that 2v2 because that is I think where they are the weakest uh Renekton
1:08:37
into Rumble is just very volatile can go either way depending on how the jungle uh matchup plays out who gets a lead
1:08:43
there first so a lot of questions going into this first game and again these teams
1:08:49
are not only fighting for their own score they're also benefiting their group you get a win for your group it
1:08:55
makes the whole LC cup a whole a lot less stressful yeah I mean you want to win or
1:09:03
yourself for your group for everything basically um as you see part of group
1:09:10
Baron is bfx and they are going to be going up against the team that is in
1:09:15
group Elder on the opposite side of the rift it is of course KT rollster and bdd
1:09:21
on the definitely a fun way to start I'm excited for this one chronicler as it looks like we are ready to hop onto the
1:09:27
rift game number one of bfx versus KY rolster starts
1:09:46
now and here we go I feel like we're on the KT side of the arena chronicler with
1:09:53
the gigantic cheer we just had everybody very excited for this KT
1:10:02
roster have early War being placed and that does confirm what I was expecting
1:10:07
KT really wants the 2v2 do know I do see Diablo and Ken here
1:10:13
because again Ash and Braum Ash alone is already an insanely oppressive Lane but
1:10:18
playing with Braum into two short-range characters and an engage support is really going to make life very very
1:10:24
tough and they are now waiting here in mid
1:10:29
don't have confirmation but they did see CLA actually move away from that Ward and I don't think that the ward there
1:10:35
was spotted and here you see indeed doom and we are able to match the swap really
1:10:41
pretty big win for them something that they're going to be very very happy about we'll see what the response of bfx
1:10:46
is going to be yeah it's h it's 2025 and Lane swaps still a thing we saw a bunch
1:10:54
of them yesterday uh I'm not sure exactly how many maybe like four out of
1:11:00
the six um but it's it's a it's definitely still a thing and it's here to stay and
1:11:07
especially because uh the early grubs are such a fought over objective it does feel like a lot of teams are trying to
1:11:14
get up there as well and uh still you know avoid certain matchups as you've been mentioning in this game
1:11:20
specifically uh maybe even put on a little bit of extra pressure with some of those resistances taken away from
1:11:26
some of those mid and top towers and stuff like that so not surprised to see Lane swaps here still with us also
1:11:33
already seeing what we talked about before even after the Nerfs something that the Zyra is also always going to
1:11:40
excel at is just power clearing Through the Jungle about I say 5 6 seconds ahead
1:11:46
of raptor we'll see if he actually able to turn it into anything cuz clear is getting relatively low but turrets if you haven't caught any games turrets are
1:11:53
a lot scarier than they used to be which I think is is quite cool I think we
1:11:58
gotten a lot better at Dives over the years and felt like turs didn't really pose much of a threat even in the lck
1:12:05
like obviously you're going to see it in soloy but even in lck we've seen teams misjudge a little bit how much damage
1:12:11
they can take it's perfect yeah he is setting up for something here but it doesn't look like KZ is going to be the
1:12:16
position instead looking to Mid but not 100% certain because he he also should
1:12:22
know that raptor is on the bottom half of the map well get spotted and looks like nothing is going to come of
1:12:28
it B missing the cannon there he is under a bit of pressure here B doing a good job as cuz has Smite but he has not
1:12:36
spotted Raptor I don't believe couple of pings in mid though so kind of have a decent idea there was maybe still a
1:12:42
plant left up in the bush uh yeah I think cuz used the scryer so he saw that
1:12:47
Raptor was on his butt side Raptor knows that with milb pryo he wouldn't be able to uh contest so so always going to go
1:12:54
for the top we'll see if he's willing to try and sneak away the Raptors here could actually is actually a fine win
1:13:00
though but instead is just going to secure a little bit of vision here yeah as we see uh the new teleports everybody
1:13:08
just flying across the map it's so funny
1:13:14
Woo you're having a great time we haven't seen I kind of expected Jon strong at some point to do a yeah
1:13:21
dramatic pan I'm sure he will he's just waiting for the right moment why not why not does H Sports have a new
1:13:28
motto I assume they all do uh yeah we should CU we have some new mots here in the L actually cuz they are great for
1:13:35
the two teams that are playing right now let me uh let me grab them take a take a moment to uh to look at those as we do
1:13:43
have cuz he is spotted up on the top side of the map and uh I mean with the
1:13:48
amount of pressure they have in the fact that they're pushing it's it's not really uh that bad of a spot although
1:13:53
it's actually pushing away from bfx at the moment and CU he been able to come in just he knows he's spotted just
1:13:59
trying to help out a little bit push them off uh that's Lane so have you
1:14:05
found the mados I have so for bfx it is dream new
1:14:12
ambition but we already have old ambition he's a streamer now yeah so why
1:14:18
do we need new ambition well I I don't have the answers to that vas I'm just saying that's they're just dreaming of it it's it's evocative I'll say that
1:14:26
okay you know it gets you thinking it does I don't know mostly about what it
1:14:31
means but it's always good to try to you know try to figure it out um so what's the
1:14:37
other one so the one for KT is is I think also very at which just time to prove ourselves what they're trying to
1:14:44
prove is obviously left unset but I think they're just trying to prove their still KT which the best way to do that
1:14:49
would be to lose hair and then beat Han they're trying to prove that they're
1:14:55
the exact same team they've always been perfect he's uh he's got a bit of damage but he's not going to get a kill Kellin
1:15:02
bit of trouble has to flash if that knockup hits from bdd he was in danger of actually being taken down for First
1:15:08
Blood and First Blood definitely still very important we saw yesterday that still you know even Atlas was talking
1:15:14
about this on this C on the cast it feels like you know if you can get objectives and kind of roll them into a first turret that feels like a you know
1:15:21
a couple of wins you can get in a row uh whereas first BL kind of stands alone you see that KT has grouped up for the
1:15:28
grubs where's bfx this is the objective that you fight over but instead they
1:15:34
just just going to kind of Let It Go yeah so this is the unfortunate uh by
1:15:40
oh okay we're going very deep for this one cuz in a lot of trouble and down he will go corki via picks up first Blood
1:15:48
very nicely set up there by Raptor that's a trade up because KT got one third of the feet FX got a full one and
1:15:58
yeah cuz thinking he get away there but obviously Raptor taking a very deep drone is going to pay with his life for
1:16:04
those Raptors um he is Raptor so obviously he gets bonus gold from the
1:16:11
Raptors um kind of goes without saying now he's this is actually very annoying um
1:16:18
it's it's buying a lot of time B's missing XP and gold and mid and stuff like that um he's still going to die but
1:16:25
either way uh it's kind of funny that he he set up this awesome first Blood he
1:16:30
got the feed of strength and he's like now I deserve to int for the Raptors I've done my job here nothing is
1:16:37
a better encapsulation of of a new player in the LC particularly for junglers cuz it's a role that's so
1:16:43
heavily based around not necessarily your mechanic they are pretty based yeah
1:16:48
agree your pathing and your knowledge one of the reasons why peanut is as
1:16:53
revered as he is uh looks like Raptor also going to be going for an early hard steal most
1:17:00
likely I've seen a lot of Tanks just opt towards that build and even with the
1:17:05
Raptors as expected and and with the fact that he died cuz is still able to maintain his CS Le but we have already
1:17:12
word that I think on the the next patch point two they are changing it to First of threee which feels a lot more even
1:17:19
and I think is a change that is going to be generally welcomed and while still maintaining
1:17:26
um a little bit of an incentive to be bloodthirsty which I appreciate yeah absolutely it feels a little bit more
1:17:31
like okay well if we win this first team fight or if we if we win this first early laning phase or if you know
1:17:38
somebody really pops off in a big way rather than just like winning one trade and oh I got them and now we've got this
1:17:44
huge feed of strength I I think it makes a lot more sense so it's a good change for it's also we're still early in the
1:17:49
season and we've already gone for the full cycle of if you lose First Blood and Feats the game is done to boots are
1:17:56
insanely and they did get hot fixed to be fair to no actually upgrading boots is bait and you should never spend the
1:18:02
money so I'm not sure where we are on the scale as of right now suffice it to say the boots are nice not by itself
1:18:10
going to be uh something that is going to win Oria the game as we do have Raptor on a big flank here corki on the
1:18:16
way as well hey just alting the whole team here on the bottom side we got teleports coming in as well the dyal is
1:18:22
huge value because is getting burned to a crib down he goes as T will pick up that kill but he is going to pay for it
1:18:29
Raptor in a lot of trouble as well perfect and bdd going so deep for it and clears Al basically does nothing but now
1:18:35
via on the flank on the top side doing a bunch of damage but he's in early game Corky with just a tiar in a face he
1:18:42
doesn't really do that much damage and so just kind of a cheerleader as diao getting knocked up here has to use his
1:18:48
alt and that is just Y in a nutshell KT going to win this trade big time blood
1:18:55
bath in the bot Lane valis it all starts Raptor does get spotted and initially it
1:19:01
looks a little dicey the Braum combined with the Zyra so much disengage but the
1:19:07
only one taking damage are the Leona with W up and Raptor so when all these
1:19:12
TPS start to come in KT is still in a great fighting spot I think they're also a little bit quicker on the trigger and
1:19:20
unfortunately without the lockdown still there the value of Rumble for example is
1:19:25
really going to drop this clear is equalizer there doesn't really get to do nearly as much whereas perfect in a
1:19:31
first scrimmage with a strink and his old top is going to be a big manace and a big early win for KT
1:19:37
here yeah it does feel pretty nice now bfx at least are going to try to get one
1:19:43
grub um so that's that doesn't feel great and cuz should be able to at least
1:19:50
oh well I say that here comes Raptor and Kellen that's a big UL for Kell they're just really abusing the lack of Mobility
1:19:58
on the Zyra now but a bunch of damage coming out from Duck they're taking a 3v4 right now as the rest of bfx is on
1:20:04
the Run they get the kill on to clear and Raptor in a bit of trouble as well now finally we're going to get the TP
1:20:09
from corki but again what is corki going to do here he doesn't do any damage right now and they might just look to
1:20:16
turn on him as well vla he's got his flash he flashes directly back into them
1:20:22
and just dies what am I watching
1:20:27
chronicler I don't have an answer why are you why are you throwing the ball to me I'm same game don't take it away
1:20:34
chronicler watching the same game as you and this is kind of I think the issue
1:20:39
with going in too aggressive on the Zyra like yes you kill cuz but his plans
1:20:45
actually end up getting the grub which is what you were kind of looking for so they still go to five and then bdd is
1:20:52
just getting untouched in these fights Zyra like brand is one of those Champions where if you don't hung the
1:20:58
derer he still got up an ultimate he still got a ton of plans out you're just not really going to be able to and the
1:21:04
fact that not only does KT
1:21:09
the okay they got what like two more kills on yon yeah two kills on yon yeah
1:21:17
dockum goes unchecked throughout that entire fight and you're playing a longer fight
1:21:23
like especially the skirmish you get multiple rotations of Braum ashon is so
1:21:29
strong like the amount of CC the amount of sustain the amount of lockdown that you have available yeah Zyra too as you
1:21:36
mentioned before like even if he goes down like plants are doing their job so funny to see Raptor desperately trying
1:21:42
to get the grub against the plants and losing um it just it just feels pretty
1:21:49
rough now BMF did get the first blood but the objective uh feat is about to go
1:21:54
the way of KT and all of their lanes are winning so yeah cuz having not the best
1:22:00
time but he's also he's got four assists he's ahead 20 Farm he's doing much better actually than raptor is which is
1:22:07
funny to say even though he has died three times so KT just as a whole as a team feeling very happy they picked up
1:22:14
the first Drake which is actually what cuz was saying in the uh the replay of
1:22:19
his comms there so it does feel like cuz is definitely calling uh a bit for for
1:22:24
the team which you would expect as Arrow coming on in Raptor not able to avoid it
1:22:30
and the CC chain is just so obnox he's got a lot of Health but not a lot of resistances as down he will go and
1:22:36
that's going to be the end of raptor once again and the biggest difference in this game I think has been the jungle
1:22:43
support Duos on either sides where it doesn't feel like Kell and raptor have really been able to sink up and it's
1:22:49
either Raptor or Kellen going in and the one time that it did work out was on CZ which then unfortunately uh didn't
1:22:56
didn't really work out and then I feel like way and CZ have been perfectly in sync and even if C end up going down way
1:23:04
then ensures that they win the followup fight man still has 100% uh kill participation as of right
1:23:11
now and thus far I think KT should be the favorites in this series looking a
1:23:16
lot cleaner across the board bfx had some okay moments and they still have good mate game fighting and that's
1:23:23
really where they going to have to hope that they can mount a comeback but right now I think things are looking great for KT yeah absolutely I mean coming into
1:23:32
this one you know KT were the favorites now in this position as you mentioned they are the favorites for the series
1:23:37
you would have to imagine and things are just flowing really well you know one of the things that we said in his interview
1:23:44
was I I've got a bunch of hung which is basically just older brothers in Korean I'm just going to piggy back I'm just
1:23:50
going to ride the bus a bit and that's fine he's doing a great job as Raptor in a bit of trouble here there's the knock
1:23:55
up from way speaking of which and Raptor will go down how do you play this game as Malai you throw out your alt and
1:24:01
you're stunned anyway and you just die so sad it's it's the offensive bra
1:24:07
mod and it works that's not supposed to happen all you need is the setup from
1:24:13
the rest of the team it looks like now we're going to look towards first turret would even with that first
1:24:20
Blood basically guarantee KT even that they already up two objectives and we
1:24:26
talk a lot about defeats as we should KT still got five grubs like that buff isn't going anywhere they're still
1:24:32
getting a ton of going oh come on wait it was still a sick Arrow I thought he
1:24:39
was going to go in they didn't do anything with it but it was cool it was
1:24:44
cool yeah so just you know casually face checking the brush
1:24:51
here just wanted to put down some visual
1:24:57
for what it's worth I don't think you have to walk up there I imagine that they just wanted to
1:25:03
secure Vision so that you could then apply a little bit of pressure towards that bot Lane but diao was still
1:25:08
clearing out the wave pre-level 11 the ability for kaisa to join was quite rough and I don't think anyone had shown
1:25:14
in mid but Raptor uh being a tank and having
1:25:19
aaly and heart steel felt relatively safe unfortunately uh not going to be
1:25:25
all right here we go nice block on the AL bdd may be in trouble but he is surviving for so long the flash is so
1:25:31
good as even an equalizer used on a bdd they finally take him down VI going to get that shutdown but what is the rest
1:25:37
of this fight going to look like it's not looking half bad for KT but we've got diao now looking that go in there
1:25:43
once duck Dom and he will take him out as he wins super deep for it though and he will be traded back perfect is
1:25:49
tanking for about a million years as well on top of the rip TD d he will in
1:25:55
the extended fight beat out clear and the rest of the team and that's another big fight in the hands of KT and with
1:26:01
this Rift Herald they will own the Feats if the Alo has a second item that
1:26:07
might have been the turnaround and here Kellen and Rapture do actually link up the problem is that there's no follow-up
1:26:14
damage initially look how long it takes for B actually go down and you invest
1:26:20
The Equalizer as well then a good amount of damage actually is done to docked on
1:26:26
by Diablo here you're like maybe they can make it happen but he doesn't crucially get the burst off and on the
1:26:31
other side uh the fight not looking too hot for effect easily able to sustain
1:26:36
and I think diao got a little bit over excited there thinking that he had the damage cuz if he just either like uh
1:26:44
have dog Dum flash out and then try to peel back and play the fight or you kill him like that would have been great but
1:26:50
not flashing over the wall definitely could have maybe led to a turn turn around now only the hole being dug
1:26:57
deeper here for bfx yeah when we were uh when we were watching that replay Chon
1:27:02
you saw my face I was watching perfect just absolutely Maul everyone that went into the pit to try to kill BD they used
1:27:10
everything to kill bdd and then perfect was was a a Dominus Renekton Kellen
1:27:16
stuck around to try to save via who was 100% dead he also died for no reason and
1:27:22
they both died and then perfect was still alive he got a third kill or a third you know Assist at least as uh we
1:27:29
are going to have this turret go down so bfx at least get that as cuz looks to send the ri T
1:27:37
potentially into mid here there it goes and Dia taking a ton of damage actually
1:27:43
as we speak meanwhile perfect up to two levels right now on clear he's got his Dominus rolling and he is so deep in
1:27:49
their jungle he just doesn't care as that oh SPID it away way going to have to out of there that was a little bit
1:27:55
scary but no charge pretty good for
1:28:00
bfx yeah he is he is mul perfect just went straight up mul first and I can guarantee you no one is doing damage to
1:28:07
that guy cuz V can't really walk in range cuz he'll get wacked and then the rest of the team is either doing AP D
1:28:14
it's the it's the the NY thing the drawing he did I it's like a meme from a while back where people I I assume were
1:28:21
like's got those old memes yeah it was like why do people pick Renekton and they just drew in paint uh I I think
1:28:28
just to Renekton going walk walk cuz he just you know presses W and then you die that makes sense yeah does make sense
1:28:34
and which is what perfect has been doing in this game huge lead cuz KDA might not be looking too pretty but I don't think
1:28:40
he's bothered whatsoever this game looking very much over here for
1:28:47
bnk yeah I mean the Fe of strength go the way of KT they also have the first two Dres with a hex tech we've got all
1:28:54
these extra bonuses and you know events going on on the rift so don't be distracted by the dragons as well we
1:29:01
didn't see as much focus on the dragons but uh they're the same so H Tech Soul
1:29:06
still very strong and of course we are going to have the uh vus atakan coming
1:29:11
out here as well and KT should just I would imagine just run it they don't
1:29:19
have to be that Brash about it you know they probably can be a little bit more
1:29:24
nuanced about how they do approach this objective but they're so far ahead that
1:29:29
I'm sure they're going to try to make it their way up here and try to take it down as soon as they possibly can yeah
1:29:35
do have to be careful we've gone over this a lot but Aon is is a scary
1:29:41
objective so this is the one opportunity that bnk have to fight their way back
1:29:47
into this game so I think that KT very wisely say well then we just don't do it
1:29:52
cuz you can't do it and we don't really have to do it just have bdd pushing in
1:29:57
the side lane someone is going to have to match him Mo the hex Gates maybe a
1:30:03
collapse possible B doesn't have Flash for a little bit but looks like instead will just be a bit of a still
1:30:09
mate and no one going to pick up the new objective for now looks very threatening
1:30:17
and that's that's true yeah I I feel like sometimes with Elder Dragon for
1:30:23
example Elder Dragon scary but Elder as as an objective is not that hard neither
1:30:29
is Baron like post it spawns at 25 now but when we got to like 27 28 minutes in
1:30:37
previous uh previous games never already felt that it's the power creep of
1:30:43
scariness in our objectives you know Baron used to be the big thing back in the day it was the only thing uh outside
1:30:49
of dragon obviously it was like once you got Baron oh that's so cool it's the biggest objective on the map you take
1:30:54
that down and then we added Elder we hadon yeah that's the that's where we're at right now we are looking to just
1:31:03
death brush someone maybe it'll work and and Perfect's better than that now I I feel like in his first season he
1:31:09
sometimes would have made that mistake he's like oh you know I got to put on pressure I'm going to farm I'm going to push up and he'd get caught from time to
1:31:16
time but no he he's a much more practiced player this guy as we know is he's got a very good uh work ethic and
1:31:23
has been putting in the work um and those Sid Lanes you know this is the lck way we have S side lanes that are
1:31:28
winning bdds ahead um Perfect's ahead so they're just going to put on pressure and slowly just choke you out rather
1:31:35
than actually you know just forcing an objective that we don't have to do they just want death St next he's never going
1:31:42
to die and currently he has zero deaths
1:31:48
yeah I think it's going to remain that way I mean you can see bnk also being like what what do we actually do I guess
1:31:55
we just start up at a con but if we do then we're going to get shred to bits and they have a ton of AOE damage so I
1:32:02
don't think we want to do that trying to force a 5v5 maybe and yeah looks like the trigger is being pulled they got to
1:32:08
do something and it wouldn't be bnk if they didn't try to hard force a play all right well that's Leona solo flare right
1:32:15
on top of duck perfect kind of an awkward spot for him actually as now has to pop the Dominus goes over the wall
1:32:21
he's kind of out of the fight he does have TP for the rest of the team is getting caught as we speak Tuck's got to
1:32:26
be careful uses both Summoners and gets out but now we got the Malai ultimate bdd trying to peel just to get them away
1:32:33
definitely a dicey situation there for KT with perfect getting caught and nearly the rest of the team as well
1:32:40
biggest win here for bnk is getting both SS on dock no flash and clench available
1:32:45
for the ash they don't have their big team fight ultimates now but if they trade soulle point for Aon I think they're going to be feeling good but it
1:32:52
takes a while to take down this objective during instead setting up the Trap which I like a lot more but there's the Hulk shot which foils their plan
1:32:59
velv best and mean there's really not much you can do as you mentioned you know it's just such a huge health bar
1:33:06
like I I don't you can't rush this thing not when KT's around you just don't really have a choice and your lanes are
1:33:13
being pushed mid lane is being pushed bot Lane is being pushed bfx are standing around trying to make something
1:33:19
happen around Aon instead they're just losing around the map and it's not feeling very good for
1:33:26
them yeah you can see that KT was also not impressed at all like bdd for that whole sequence he had TP he was just
1:33:33
like yeah it's fine then I'm going to do it I'm going to take dragon and then I'm going to just continue pushing the side wave and uh call me if you need me and
1:33:41
they did not call round two maybe uh
1:33:48
yeah I'm trying to find angles for BN K here and I think there we saw bit of it
1:33:54
it is important to note that KT does not really have a traditional front line right like they have a great Bruiser
1:34:01
they have Braum obviously can take uh a large amount of Bea in but if someone is
1:34:06
out of position and they get hit by a clear ultimate uh couple of Autos from via and or
1:34:13
diab there might be an opportunity here and KT the place where they are going to
1:34:19
I think never ever give up superity is the sideline with how fed both perfect and
1:34:24
but in a 5v5 if KT Mis execute or if Doom gets caught again no STS right now
1:34:30
might be an opportunity but I do think B andk then have to pull the trigger on something doesn't look like that's
1:34:36
happening right now cuz once those sums are back up that sequence of play gets a lot harder to execute yeah the League of
1:34:43
Legends we love and know you know it's it's kind of like if you're behind you don't really have a lot of presence on the map so you can't really get good
1:34:49
positioning on objectives if the enemy team is doing well and aon's pretty much just another objective right so um KT
1:34:57
just doing the oldfashioned way and looking for clear here might be in a bit of trouble Dominus popped as slowly but
1:35:04
surely big equalizer but perfect doesn't really care with that M as to flash away but he will be taken down has to flash
1:35:11
away from that really strong turret but perfect with the solo kill might be taken out here but that means
1:35:16
immediately oh he's trying to TP away and he will get away actually there you go not able to be interrupted either
1:35:25
and Jonah strong gives us what we wanted Bel this there is the follow Raptor con
1:35:31
get into the pit that's the objective gone and everything goes K's way they
1:35:37
win the objective perfect gets out with the solo bolo and bnk
1:35:46
shambles okay thiss a very interesting play they are going to take out duck and
1:35:53
again take out is in quotes because he's going to Res back at the uh the camp as
1:35:58
now trying to get back into this one and KT just going to force it with their reses here going as deep as they
1:36:05
possibly can for as many kills as possible at the end of the day though I mean they only get one so not really the
1:36:12
best usage I would say of the vasus oton dive sequence that we always seem to see
1:36:18
it feels like bfx honestly handled it not so bad for being Delta really bad
1:36:23
okay Diablo's just going crazy though uh that's not worth it and the Flash is definitely not worth it either
1:36:30
so yeah I don't know about that one I do wasn't great uh unfortunately for Diablo
1:36:37
I think we're seeing some uh first game Jitters if we give him the benefit of the doubt going in very aggressively but
1:36:45
there was still the buff if the buff wasn't there and you trade your life for ash there might be worth if you keep
1:36:51
your sums it definitely feels a lot better and now KT no ad carry on the enemy team starting up Nash and looks
1:36:59
like they will be able to get it without too much of an itch can they get out though yeah I don't I don't think so you
1:37:04
know they're trying to force this one 4v5 if they had kaisa you know maybe you get something going in a 5v5 maybe you
1:37:10
can prevent the baron perfect goes in and gets so much health back and he's trying to take a vla and he almost does
1:37:18
as the Assassin bra gets in way going to take him down and and that's going to
1:37:24
keep clear around as well no escaping that as Baron is taken for KT and he got
1:37:29
to think that the hex te is up next in this whole sequence the only kill the bnk got was wayy the rest we all revived
1:37:36
F this this is a
1:37:42
Slaughter yeah I got I got nothing uh they're they're BK trying their best
1:37:47
make a play but they are lacking so much damage The Equalizer doesn't really get enough done and as mention
1:37:54
perfect is a RAID boss even if he doesn't die here like
1:38:00
this play is great with the buff there's not even anything that you can do way I assume going
1:38:08
QX box is here by the way I'm sure he'll he'll check and call it out for us if it
1:38:13
is the case but bnk we've reached a point of the game where they're just
1:38:18
trying oh God that's oh no the crocodile he's waiting oh no oh he's
1:38:24
waiting oh Raptor oh I feel so bad for this guy um he is going to use this just
1:38:30
to advance and advance to his death he's trying his best but his best is not good
1:38:35
enough and a big equalizer clear's going to up those damage numbers but I'm I'm sorry that doesn't win you very many
1:38:42
games Flash volley comes in from Duck after the Q lands from way and that
1:38:48
might just do it I mean KT we got perfect he's in the base he's just in
1:38:54
their face and not allowing them to do anything hex Soul KT looking to put an
1:38:59
end to the slaughter no there's been videos of crocodiles uh putting their
1:39:04
arms up acting out like they're people to try and lure people in you know
1:39:09
they're adapting at any point the crocodile the apex predator are you sure that's not aiing chronicler well don't
1:39:15
be fooled don't be fooled by what you see on the internet nowadays well that actually makes a lot of sense
1:39:23
I was believing a slightly more magical world Bel us but I guess that's something I mean that would be really cool actually if that were
1:39:30
real I guess it's not as uh perfect just as my dreams are dashed uh I know that
1:39:37
bnk is dreaming to make their Ambitions a reality but in this one I think that's
1:39:43
going to remain the dream just like uh the Ling crocodiles a crocodile were
1:39:49
they standing up as well like on their hind legs or no no no but if it was that obvious I would have clocked it okay
1:39:56
give me give me a little bit of credit I was just curious to what level uh did they get you um okay Kellen just trying
1:40:03
to make a play they're going to get Cous I guess as the is going to knock them up a decent equalizer as well now it's 4v5
1:40:11
very awkward fight here for KT but does it matter is the question and I think the answer will be uh answered very very
1:40:19
quickly as B bnk just trying to run away here oh nice Shield there clear barely
1:40:25
able to survive for a second longer raptor is up next and now KT will put
1:40:30
them out of their misery took them a little bit of extra time they wanted to take the hex skates they wanted to be a bit cleaner with it instead uh they get
1:40:38
caught and they win the fight anyway and the game is over 60 and 10 is perfect 81
1:40:45
and 6 is bdd it is a very clean game
1:40:50
here from the side of KT to take down game number one of this best of
1:40:56
three that was a big down VES didn't feel off mid game like there
1:41:02
was an opportunity for bnk to get a whole lot done and despite their best
1:41:09
efforts I think yeah the faces really kind of say it all not anything that they could do and meanwhile on KT
1:41:16
everyone looking happy they got their objectives I think they play the Skirmish as well perfect got to play one
1:41:22
of his favorite Champions and showcased why it was very often banned against him
1:41:27
as we got towards the end of last year it's going to be an uphill battle for bnk because this match felt very
1:41:35
one-sided from very early on yeah it definitely was I I still feel
1:41:40
like we have a lot of developing players here on the bnk roster and uh you know
1:41:46
one of a couple of guys that are there you know you saw at the end via and Kellen I don't really see them as shot
1:41:51
callers either I feel like wasn't really a cohesive feeling from the side of b k
1:41:58
i I'll have to hope that they can figure it out as the lck cup comes along because KT rollster it's like a
1:42:04
well-oiled machine already and you can see that cuz despite dying so many times most damage in the game not very
1:42:11
surprising Zyra so a very fun game here for KT we're going to take a short break
1:42:17
and come back with the space we'll be right back
1:42:23
a
1:43:26
I
1:44:22
spe fore
1:44:36
speee fore
1:44:56

1:47:20
again the bringing in I like it
1:47:28
the I like you the
1:48:18
back
1:48:33
right
1:49:16
hello everyone and welcome back to the space as we had our first battle between
1:49:21
the two teams that made it to play house but didn't quite make it to Worlds as KT go up 10 Z over bnk fear X welcome back
1:49:29
everyone Deon alongside what did and Ox uh also known as
1:49:36
wax always on never off that one was bad everyone I'm sorry
1:49:42
I'll let it sit for a while no no no let's let's move on that one was our most one-sided game so far in the 2025
1:49:50
season uh where did it go wrong her Hax uh I mean I feel like there was just
1:49:57
like a lot of fights where they kind of fell for the bait of the Zyra you know they were like hey we bid zyra's flash
1:50:04
let's let's targ out let's punish that and then they kind of didn't realize like what of the things with playing
1:50:09
Zyra is if you press all your buttons it doesn't really matter if you die and I feel like this clip really highlights it
1:50:15
so like you know the focus comes out of CZ cuz presses all his buttons and to really illustrate that not only does he
1:50:21
manage to turn the fight on he actually gets the grub with the plant um so job done even though cuz went down yeah I
1:50:28
mean I think I really like the the approach from the KT they could pick sejuani in the draft right and go for
1:50:35
the boring match up maai seani but uh they have C in the jungle so why not why
1:50:40
not just go for Zyra and play aggressive and proactive in the early game and I think that kind of worked out in the KT
1:50:47
o game especially and also uh it shows that how KT is really like being being
1:50:52
proud of their team competition yeah I like that because it was strength to strength raptor is someone on bnk 3x who
1:50:59
proved himself which is one of the reasons why he was coming on back where it's cuz returning to KT known as a very
1:51:04
solid player both teams investing into that one but KT Tak a slight Edge despite how many times that Zyra died
1:51:11
now our second highlight here is one again up by the rift Herald area and
1:51:16
this one is uh more of like an educational class here for diao yeah I mean I think it
1:51:23
good opportunity for bnk game uh look at DIA position here he
1:51:28
cleared the vision out and he zoned out both damage dealers and the moment that
1:51:34
he Ed in was really bad before that I think they kind of space them out really really good but after that kaisa ulti
1:51:42
they kind of fell out yeah I think the control will down playing around the vision with the
1:52:11
y
1:52:28
our an ox Pro tier so uh there's a new objective in the rift right yeah and I
1:52:36
feel like you know they still
1:52:50
leing ideal
1:53:06
head shot
1:53:15
you as you can see
1:53:20
right hello uh we're back uh very quickly sorry about that issue guys was
1:53:25
very funny on hour and uh we'll take the desk from here I know those guys on the space are trying their hardest but uh uh
1:53:32
D just thought that we could do a better job so as you were saying W did and a pro tip uh I think two out of three of
1:53:39
those guys generally do great work a uh you're on fin ice as 're going take a
1:53:45
look I'm joking I love vs uh going to take a look at the draft that we had and again a reminder if you're just watching
1:53:52
for the first some of you're a KT fan you haven't really known what's going on none of these Champions can be played
1:53:58
again now looking at these it's it's actually interestingly enough I don't
1:54:03
even feel like outside of the ash we hit that many Super hyow Y is up there but
1:54:08
desyra is not something that we've seen that much of maai also on that list so we'll see if the bands are going to
1:54:14
change when we get into our next game I'm also happy to report that I checked on the crocodile video and while it was
1:54:21
real don't you dare hold on let me let me just show you the picture that he thought was real uh he was just eating
1:54:28
so I still got I still got punked but it wasn't that's that's not the video I want to be very upfront about this I saw
1:54:35
an extra he thought that was real that was real uh surely uh people don't think
1:54:42
I would fall to thatat right anyway it was a great it was a
1:54:47
great draft uh from KT rollster I think the Zyra fit cuz very well and playing around bdd and cuz is always going to
1:54:54
work very well uh for this team yeah for uh BK in the next game it's hard because
1:55:00
this is one of those games where kind of everything goes poorly every lane was I think via individually was fine yeah he
1:55:06
was the only one that was doing okay as uh uh no Pro tip they're not going to be
1:55:13
able to teach you anything you have to wait till the next space they were really excited about it
1:55:18
as well cuz we have the group chat you know and they were like guys we have such good tips maybe they could have helped bnk pull
1:55:25
was but we'll never know we'll never know yeah so uh gon has a tip don't
1:55:32
believe everything you see on social media um just for all of you guys out there and maybe some casters I know why
1:55:39
I'm getting roasted by jesa actually I do know why it's because we roasted her yesterday uh forting
1:55:45
a that's true that Mak sense you guys can see you know the Korean desk going on behind us that's kind of cool
1:55:52
they they've got a cool setup over there although I do like our noxis features a little bit more on our space the color
1:55:59
well well not the outfits but our actual space you know it's more like no themed
1:56:04
oh no it's it's cool it it feels really awesome also to to sit in on it's great
1:56:11
which maybe we'll get a I haven't done that day uh how about a Val host experience good
1:56:19
enough for me um on Sunday I I think that's a thing um so game
1:56:27
two we are getting ready for group Elder here KT is part of group Elder I know a
1:56:35
lot of you are still out there like what's the lck cup what are we do what's group Elder um I do encourage you yeah
1:56:42
where's valid questions patch on some patches um I would encourage you to go
1:56:48
ahead and uh read a little bit more into it because it's a very cool system and so far group Baron and group Elder
1:56:54
are tied if your group wins you have a better seating situation going into the
1:56:59
playoffs and uh you potentially avoid knock off knockout right from the getg go so uh definitely a cool system we got
1:57:07
this time around but let's get into the draft for game number two you'll see at the top those Champs they cannot be
1:57:13
picked again it won't happen we'll have to restart the draft if they do
1:57:19
it andessa going to remain on the ban list scarner feels like a must red side
1:57:25
ban wouldn't be opposed to BK leaving that one open as o this is something that I think
1:57:32
we've seen the most particularly with yon and corki already out Banning 8
1:57:37
carries picking one early and then continuing to ban just more and more of them as you get deeper into a round of
1:57:43
fearless is quite strong hoping that eventually it leads us to things like Graves you know making
1:57:49
an appearance would always be cool scarner I think to me is really the
1:57:55
no-brainer and I don't think you should be banning scarner on blue side this is
1:58:00
an insane champion at the moment being case call I imagine is just that they
1:58:06
don't want to play towards but it feels like he's so versatile as well not really tied to having to play a specific
1:58:12
team composition just an insanely strong tank and kante this time does make it
1:58:18
through the draft will be big top here but with the angle that KT take and I imagine they're going to prioritize
1:58:23
picking up an ad carry here and pinching that pool further yeah I I think when you're
1:58:29
playing up against a newer ad carry in dible you know what his champ pool looks
1:58:34
like you know what you can take away from him and you can uh have duck Dom essentially play anything I mean this
1:58:40
guy even if you want to go back to the old days he could pick up an aelio I don't think you really need to dig that
1:58:46
deep on this patch in particular but he could do it Caitlyn a consideration now
1:58:52
very strong there's the Caitlyn maybe some Caitlyn Lux action uh
1:58:59
does appear in Arcane so I haven't watched season 2 I don't I think only ORS has maybe we
1:59:06
did as well I am uh what's your excuse I was I was watching I was
1:59:12
watching othero anime you know and actually I started it while uh I watched episode one of season
1:59:19
2 and then I got distracted and I haven't got back to it s that makes a lot of sense um is Arcane really an
1:59:26
anime though it's not really well it's animation it's not an anime yeah it's not an anime yeah yeah but it falls
1:59:32
under the larger the umbrella umbrella I would say jce actually can't believe we
1:59:38
haven't talked about also in Arcane also yes VI has already been banned and this
1:59:44
is quite funny but they might even end up playing Jinx depending on what the bands are going to be here for KT they
1:59:51
already have their 8 carry locked and loaded so don't have to be worried can
1:59:57
further pinch that pool and Caitlin is the type of ad that can really take over a game if she gets going early doesn't
2:00:05
look like it's actually going to be the case although this kind of feels like a soft ban towards the Zia as well but who
2:00:10
wants to play Z and the Caitlyn I hope not I can think of some teams and some ad carries that would do it anyway they
2:00:17
would yeah I also I got to say I think buong is super under prioritized right
2:00:23
now Wukong to me feels like with how strong the team fighting compositions in the game are at the moment he is just
2:00:30
insane also nocturn is something that yesterday was really heavily prioritized in both series was also picked up even
2:00:37
the dnf didn't win that game the knctr still looked amazing so we still clearly have some different meta reads as we get
2:00:43
into our second day of fearless yeah also very important update uh Max Atlas
2:00:49
Anderson has in fact watched Arcane so um you take that back he says and uh he
2:00:57
also watched it okay well that's that's that's great I'm glad that we could rectify that thank you very much we
2:01:02
don't want to spread any misinformation about who watched Arcane yeah but about crocodiles it's okay okay
2:01:08
can we let as as here is also banned here the
2:01:14
Aurora going to get taken off the table as well there is a potential for this Chase to go towards bdd instead of going
2:01:20
towards top side uh but it looks like the read from bnk is that it most likely is just going to
2:01:27
go to perfect to be played into D Cante with the Victor Lock in we will have the
2:01:32
confirmation that it is indeed the case and guess what you know why Victor looks the way he does I don't it's Arcane I mean you know
2:01:43
you kind of tell in in season 1 you could yeah I don't know what's happened in season 2 but you know yeah uh it's
2:01:51
not a big surprise oh diaab that's a throwback uh
2:01:57
that's that's also a lane swap I don't think you want to play zeran what most likely will be Kate and Lux straight up
2:02:04
that does not seem like a good time yeah uh the Zer itself with the
2:02:09
composition does feel pretty nice well yeah yeah Zer and
2:02:15
re again not a Duo that you want to play into Caitlyn oh boy okay bard
2:02:24
see what way is going to lock in here the part would make sense this is a
2:02:31
lot better into the Wukong and ra but does and even kante I'd say but does
2:02:37
obviously suffer from not feeling quite as strong with the Caitlyn specifically uh generally with Caitlyn getting
2:02:44
something that's a bit more Lane dominant feels really good because allows you to Snowball the lane early I got to say I when look looking
2:02:52
at these with the name blades off I take the bnk com as long as you can get the lane swap off not have the Z stuck in
2:02:57
the lane against the Caitlin which obviously will be a really bad time it is a lot of Team fighting Power great
2:03:02
engage uh nice damage spread lot of AOE CC versus composition that I think has
2:03:08
strong Champions but doesn't really feel like it gels together in quite the same way yeah it does feel like a little bit
2:03:16
tier listy right from the side of KT whereas their their composition last time actually felt more like a
2:03:22
composition that all works very well together um so we'll see if they can make it work I I think with the skill
2:03:29
Gap that we saw in game one I wouldn't be surprised like you were saying before you know name Plate's on or name Plate's
2:03:35
off you know maybe you take the bnk comp but um name Plate's on I have to say
2:03:40
that KT might just also bop them so um we'll see how it does go as we're
2:03:46
getting ready oh there's there's a is that that's aaman yep Pimon that's crazy
2:03:54
that's that's a throwback that's really well done artwork yeah that's a cool bdd
2:04:00
fan right there why is bdd aan I don't knowas what's the relation there I don't know enough about Digimon lore he plays
2:04:07
a lot of Digimon games apparently on stream said that's very cool good for you bdd I didn't know that that's very
2:04:15
cool just another reason to like him either way guys we have game number two it is starting right now
2:04:38
here we go game number two on the way another update from Bas gson apparently
2:04:43
his second account in Solo CU bdd is named aan can we verify that cuz he does
2:04:49
kind of look like a crocodile and I don't want to I don't want to get pranked again today uh we have confirmation from Jon
2:04:57
that this is in fact uh real so that's good to know is the lane swap that I
2:05:03
imagine BF uh bnk sorry is going to look for is not spotted yet we do actually
2:05:11
have KT going for the same obviously with Caitlyn it is one of those situations where I think if you're
2:05:16
laning you're happy but if you're just hitting a turret and Zoning a Melee character out of a lot of experience and
2:05:22
waves and you're also going to be feeling good there's a lot of vision though here towards the top side of the map so being a will have a ton of info
2:05:29
as to where everyone is going and what the pathing of CZ is going to
2:05:35
be and just going to be perfect by his Lonesome playing I imagine this is going
2:05:42
to be not the tank Jace uh as he uh nice use of the gate there to dodge from that
2:05:48
crash down trying to get his experience in but uh we've seen both actual tank JS
2:05:54
and just going grasp and health items like Cleaver for example is always going to feel really good both on Jace because
2:06:00
of the W and how quickly you can stack it but also in Cante as a tank match up um but they don't have that much
2:06:08
front line uh with wayy being y one although I guess sinzo is deceptively
2:06:14
tanky as well see what build ends up going for yeah the Sha and the poppy together uh they've got a couple of
2:06:19
circles that could uh create a lot of space you know they're they don't especially cuz support poppy not going
2:06:26
to be ultra tanky and then shinda isn't the tankiest jungler obviously so they're not like
2:06:32
tanks normally uh that you would expect uh but they can create a lot of space
2:06:37
and uh provide a front line for the team at least so we'll see how it does go Kellen
2:06:43
is hanging around in the top River just saying hello to his friend way clear is not having a very fun time as he has to
2:06:50
Lane into C instead of uh dible he is the sacrifice
2:06:55
he is the top laner meanwhile uh we do see that perfect now is solo laning against
2:07:03
dible and might be just fine with that here comes Ken up to the top side yeah duckon taking that turret shot
2:07:10
again a reminder turrets hit way harder now so that's a much bigger mistake than it would have been
2:07:16
previously noxus turrets just hit a little different to see a lot of trading
2:07:21
in mid between bdd and Via but neither of these two Champions should be
2:07:26
expected to do a whole lot of solo killing early on just going to be look at the scale was O clear wasn't that far
2:07:33
off the wall that could have been a lot worse had that hit nice attempt there from way yeah you know maybe he should
2:07:40
have just gone ahead and uh full sent it unlock the hex Flash and uh knock him into the wall
2:07:46
100% maybe put on a bit more pressure in your your pop you've got hex Flash but
2:07:51
just playing a cal you know they don't know exactly where the ra is is this this match up as I said I feel like this is pretty good for perfect he's going
2:07:58
for the kill going to die anyway instead as diao takes him down perfect a little
2:08:05
bit of hesitation in that trade maybe if he committed to it 100% he would have
2:08:11
taken him down in said he is the one who goes down that's huge as well getting a
2:08:17
kill on the one member that you want fet for BN k perect also having to use his
2:08:23
teleport immediately do note that both the barrier and the flesh were used but
2:08:29
yeah I think perfect felt with the extra resistances on his melee form that he
2:08:34
would be good but not going to be the case it's also one of those scenarios where with conqueror probably win that
2:08:41
but with grasp you know in short trades a lot stronger also obviously going to get a ton of value out of that resolve
2:08:47
tree but taking a really big risk there does not end up paying off and bnk looking
2:08:56
better here early on and just going to dash over the Rocks there but Vias stunned in the field he
2:09:03
will commit to the flash but the Victor could chase down going to tank the turret even flashes away but he's so low
2:09:09
as Raptor desperate he wants the kill and he will trade it back as way just kind of saunters off there and does get
2:09:17
away so a trade one for one at the end of the day and another reminder of how
2:09:24
scary the turrets are so we take another look here see lethal Tempo slowly being
2:09:31
he still tanks the Q and he still wins it that's crazy go the cuz nla cheering on his uh his
2:09:43
teammate and going to the mid lane play via I think this flash actually is fine
2:09:49
we're still very early on so there is a decent the cool Downs it forces BBD to both further go in and commit his Flash
2:09:57
and he still end up getting a one for one trade bnk is going to be that's raptor getting a kill as well and again
2:10:04
Wukong realistically if he just gets the farm to six and his teammates are behind you're going to be happy getting an
2:10:10
early kill and possibly getting yourself some early objectives as well bnk looking very different in this game
2:10:16
number two yeah definitely feels uh pretty fun
2:10:21
for them I mean you've got your Cante unlocked up on the top side now perfect going to go up to there KT will be able
2:10:27
to take down this hex tech Drake at least so that's the one kind of consolation priz they get this time no
2:10:34
hex soul in the second game and no infernal Soul
2:10:39
either as uh see the aacon symbol up there on the top right almost
2:10:45
definitely well not almost actually just definitely is going to just be voracious every single time
2:10:52
so don't get your hopes up unless we have some insane kind of game some level one or something that really turns the
2:10:58
tides of the action there is a ward there on Dia and that is AER with level six so duck
2:11:05
really has to play this one carefully especially because he's
2:11:11
alone even if Kellen wasn't there I think dog J playing smartly the all in
2:11:18
realistically not going to be able to win if you are able to Whittle down dible with your Superior order range
2:11:25
should be fine but we can see there as well I think the issue is that yes you have a bigger range but zeri does have a
2:11:31
lot of inap ability not hard to get on top of you way now matching the 2v2 but
2:11:38
again that one kill means a pretty substantial lead and I think the gold is where you want it to be for bnk f the
2:11:45
only one that is a little bit behind because he didn't get the kill well BD did P only got the assist but still
2:11:52
doing solid in terms of experience and it is the type of game where both cuz
2:11:58
and we are going to have a much less fun time as in they go oh boy level six Wukong comes in and bdd doesn't have
2:12:04
Flash he's in a lot of trouble but actually just kind of walks it off as Raptor flashes in does chew through the
2:12:11
Shields and gets down the Victor but cuz might be able to at least punish this
2:12:16
one it's going to dash back over the rock so it doesn't stun as the Clone Bo him a little bit and now we got Kell
2:12:22
coming in as well wey picks up a kill but this is just a disaster for KT bnk
2:12:28
looking for more as wayy will just flash over the wall big wins there for bnk not only do
2:12:38
they take down BD oh okay uh uh bdd he just TP back everyone you might
2:12:45
not see it from his health bar but we also had to train the Lane which
2:12:52
seemingly did go the way of diao he still has his all to oh cuz there I
2:12:57
think he was trying to look for the timing to slow down Raptor but instead
2:13:02
he eat into the old and it just kind of kind of boomed him
2:13:09
unfortunately so I I get to take another look at that again and that is even oh
2:13:14
the yeah Diablo goes in for that one you know he almost one shots duck duck still
2:13:20
has his barrier and he's really not under too much pressure but scary moment
2:13:26
there that was also like he did have ult in like 5 seconds in the Alo took a bit of a risk is very clean setup here
2:13:33
initially Right comes through uh a lot of damage with the knock up and then
2:13:39
that moment right there that could have been otherwise something that I think turns it around if KZ is able to
2:13:44
actually get on top get the knock up and then bdd stays alive gets another rotation up would have been huge but
2:13:50
then here especially when you're fighting the Clone those extra Autos actually end up making a big difference
2:13:55
and then the fact that wey trying to save his K even as to invest his own flash does get hex flash but still would
2:14:02
much rather have that flash available going to be bnk nothing crazy you know these are not
2:14:08
game-winning but they do pain in a very different picture and as we said before
2:14:15
would anything be more KT as uh to to somehow take the L in
2:14:22
this St I say with caution because uh we're we're not close to it happening
2:14:27
yet but there are some worrying signs valz it is uh it's difficult to take the
2:14:32
KT out of KT you can never do it and here's Clea on the TP flank we've also got the Wukong Al Only Hits duck he's
2:14:39
totally fine way also walking it off he finally goes down but now we got the Z
2:14:44
and the sir moment beginning to brew here he's looking for perfect he wants cous as well he says give me all The
2:14:51
Kills I'll take them down bdd just chasing he's had a wild game so far he's
2:14:56
flashing FES that's a triple yeah he's going to get the triple on bdd is just dead I mean maybe he gets Raptor here
2:15:03
who's doing the crom I I've seen didn't lose those let's
2:15:09
be careful there gr get respected D's dead as well there four kills to the
2:15:15
side of bnk and they're getting more grubs so now this is becoming more than
2:15:21
just so KT are playing a funny early game they're just straight up losing BK are calling their Bluff this is so B
2:15:27
watch CLA here there is a blastone there and he just ice gold flashes over the wall
2:15:33
again in as soon as possible I think for me actually the biggest winner is Rapture does so much damage gets so much
2:15:40
celd and then gets out with his life bdd I don't think he really had to go all in
2:15:46
and and Flash aggressively to try and get the and then so if will just plays every single game like this regardless
2:15:53
of whether he's ahead or not at least we'll have fun vales uh as now four and
2:15:58
zero on the Z and the the comp of BF of bnk is going
2:16:06
to continue to be good like this is not a situation what we saw yesterday were like oh it's a n what what can they do
2:16:13
and just on the day where wolf isn't there we have a four Oar 12 he's
2:16:19
watching at home Shirley I'm sure you can certify it uh for us uh officially
2:16:24
but yeah there should be an infernal Drake going over the way of KT so they take that down that's the one thing that KT has is some Drakes and it's a
2:16:32
mountain Soul here which I feel like is going to be useful regardless bdd he's
2:16:37
just playing dying simulator he's playing yesterday like Fiesta um he's going to get knocked into the Rocks as
2:16:43
well and that'll be his fourth death there's now way trying to make it up for him will uh once again get the kill so
2:16:50
that's two kills now for way yeah that's that's kills for Poppy and they trade mid for support Kell doesn't care about
2:16:57
dying but bdd is going to miss out on a lot of Cs one and four at the moment
2:17:04
and these Victors have been seemingly just dying a lot like I don't know what
2:17:10
the combined Victor KDA is but I know that fiser yesterday couldn't have helped uh with did I say Fiesta you did
2:17:18
yeah which it is a n sh mid it just makes so much sense like almost impressed by myself like yeah this FS no
2:17:24
it's fish uh and and the game does also uh it was a bit of a Fiesta cuz here way
2:17:32
just ensuring that they do end up taking down Kellen but the fact that he gets the kill instead of cuz that feels a bit
2:17:38
rough does mean Poppy's going to be tank here but that's not really what you want the Saving Grace for KT is that they are
2:17:45
still looking pretty okay in terms of Feats as they have two dragons but if these mountains start
2:17:51
going over to bnk you're not going to get through them perfect is in fact as we look back to
2:17:59
what we talked about the beginning of the game is going for tank Jays so you have tank jaay zenzo a horribly put
2:18:06
behind Victor and Caitlyn and then you're playing into Cante and Wukong and and Wukong has a
2:18:13
passive that gives him ton of armor so you can't really give up Mountain Drakes but this is going to be defeats secured
2:18:20
here for bnk and if they end up picking up a couple of plated steel caps I'm not
2:18:27
going to be upset Valdes yeah no I think that's just the
2:18:32
right the right call no reason to get upset over it um and yeah I I'm not a big fan of this
2:18:39
tank j i we haven't seen it really in a winning position I feel yet unless that
2:18:45
happened yesterday and I missed it I was watching all the games but I don't I I don't recall that happen
2:18:51
so maybe we'll feel a little bit different about it as we see more games and we see it begin to win and see you
2:18:57
know where the power lies like there must be a reason why we're seeing it played more often than just normal Jace
2:19:05
but yeah from a losing position it just feels like you're not doing anything um
2:19:10
so yeah that that's going to go off but that is kante so I don't know if you can kill him uh way Al is going to go
2:19:15
totally wide and now he is kidnapped by the Cante uh does get away cuz No Escape
2:19:21
for him as he's trying to walk it off actually but clear just gets in there it's a total Mees of a fight and it's
2:19:27
going all the way up bnk they're absolutely shredding KT here the
2:19:32
weirdest fight maybe I've seen today and B K that's just their comfort zone A dia
2:19:38
this guy is a maniac he's crazy what is going on he's oh oh he's
2:19:44
not even going to get the kill oh he does have flash just a couple of seconds off but he would have gotten that
2:19:51
I I don't even recall him playing like this in in Challenger League like we used to cast them all the
2:19:57
time no I I did but I think at some point BK started losing a lot and then he
2:20:02
stopped I remember this being a thing when he very first came on to to Challengers but then I I still don't
2:20:10
know if it's the right call but it's definitely the call he's making as we take another look this is what we're talk he doesn't even have a mountain
2:20:17
Drake yet they don't have damage to kill a Cante here and then Raptor obviously very fed
2:20:23
trying to follow into the choke point we see another example of cus trying to have an impact and then Kellen and Theo
2:20:31
are great on the rotation they're in time all the coold Downs have gone it and trying to kill a Cante that just
2:20:37
shrugs it off yeah I mean at the end of the day if you're losing to this bnk comp you've
2:20:43
got uh a Fed Wukong a Fed zeri a Fed Cante you're not getting away like you
2:20:49
begin to lose and the issue is you know KT if this game goes a good 40 minutes
2:20:55
and we see something like Fisher yesterday uh eventually have his comeback moments then yeah maybe okay
2:21:01
but they're just taking every single possible fight that they can it's collector Caitlyn and Blackfire torch
2:21:09
Victor into a four and zero Cante F that yeah they're just never going to die
2:21:15
that itemization is just asking to lose here for the next
2:21:20
20 25 minutes well I I have a actually I think it's just losing the
2:21:26
game you know I they'll lose before I don't think I don't think we're going to reach a point yeah we also have some
2:21:33
defensive timization outside of of clear VI so which I am not the biggest fan of
2:21:38
going both Merks and Archangels cuz you actually don't do a whole lot of damage but you do have a six and zero Zer so
2:21:44
maybe Vias is just saying I just press e on top of Diablo and then they win the fight anyway so who cares
2:21:52
yeah and this is the start of the stacking of mountains vales if you
2:21:58
fought clear was already tanky things are about to get a whole lot worse and this just feels right I
2:22:04
think after an exceptionally one-sided game number one where KT just completely
2:22:10
obliterated them here we are there it is bnk versus
2:22:17
KT I I think we could have seen this coming um you said it at the top of the day you're like oh today's just another
2:22:23
six gamer because you know this series was the one you know the next one we have DK versus uh T1 that one could
2:22:31
absolutely go through games this one I was like no should be two I you know I think KT's got it uh oh boy you know
2:22:37
I've been casting the LK for a very long time and I still don't get it um duck uh
2:22:42
he's just maybe dead he is going to flash though to get out of this one uh but that's a free Caitlyn flash with uh
2:22:49
Aon coming up here in a minute maybe the lesson is they can change players they
2:22:56
can change trios they can go from from B way back sandbox to live sandbox to now
2:23:02
bnk uh FX but they're just always going to go in and if they're ahead it's going to
2:23:09
look good vales that's that's how it feels because I don't feel like bnk is particularly
2:23:16
playing any different but the Alo is six and zero he's like the same way that he
2:23:21
did last game from ahead from behind yeah well I
2:23:27
feel like uh both Zer and kaisa are Champs that you would kind of want to do it on but especially zeri even more so
2:23:34
than kaisa kaisa is like okay you got to kind of pick and choose your moments we also have really good poke once you had
2:23:40
free items you don't even have to go that crazy true he will as we saw he is
2:23:48
Dia I'm sure he's going to going to gain a lot of fans from this game which I'm happy about you know yeah between him
2:23:54
and lazy feel it's a good time if you love ad carries that Flash Forward yeah I like that that's good I feel like ad
2:24:01
carries they've they've taken they've taken it for too long you know they they've had enough of a beating and
2:24:08
they're like you know what I'm finally going to fight back I I you know ad0 carry in 2025 2024 2023 2022 2021
2:24:17
they've heard enough and uh now they're taking the fight too okay you're not telling me that like Peak Gil Force 8
2:24:23
carries were struggling vales I remember that stuff that was that was that was still getting
2:24:29
memes oh so bnk say we are so far ahead we can
2:24:34
just do out of and they're right this is a this is a different situation to the first game we had actually where KT were
2:24:40
ahead but it was like a little bit more of a it was it was yeah it was a bit more subtle and it was mostly game State
2:24:46
as opposed to just being what like 7K multiple item finishes
2:24:52
ahead still going to look as I think they should but look at Raptor yeah here comes Raptor there is
2:24:59
the WBO combo into the back line nice poy Al actually Wade trying his
2:25:04
hardest and the TP from bdd I do not know about that one actually I do he's
2:25:11
dead and not going to do anything and neither this tank Jace as he will go down B and K they don't get the Aon but
2:25:19
they don't need the he's just flashing into like three people again he doesn't care oh man uh BK going
2:25:28
to get out of and they were already aggressive they're
2:25:33
now also going to have the G available so they can be even more aggressive yeah
2:25:40
pen and Raptor just set up really nicely here flash q no opportunity for
2:25:46
counterplay but what I love most is just how ready everyone on BK is to just follow that up and this is the moment I
2:25:52
was talking about CLA actually gets the Y up and the ab's like oh I'm not close enough just skating over the wall is he
2:25:59
going to get me there flashes into two people me Shield me did he have to
2:26:06
probably not and now he has an infinity edge and we already knew that this game was kind of dunzo but with that Aon buff
2:26:12
being secured all right dible let's see it let's see the next level it doesn't
2:26:19
have Flash anymore send it down mid lane just solo Dash into like five people I
2:26:25
feel like if it was only him and Duck and mid he would absolutely just dive the turret just to have a
2:26:31
chance hey even if you only trade Health that's worth you know set up for a second
2:26:39
dragon ow I bonked on the head yeah this Wukong
2:26:44
is not just well you know old Wukong he actually kind of slaps well it's also is
2:26:50
one of those Champions that if they get ahead early the mid game like it just
2:26:55
feels so oppressive because they're not supposed to supposed to scale nicely into the game and then come mid game you have a really big impact in your team
2:27:02
fights all right here we go we're pressing our buttons and duom doesn't have Flash so he's dead and down he will
2:27:09
go again vasus atakan we are diving as far as we possibly can Raptor he is
2:27:16
Unleashed and we will knock up everybody in that back line they're only going to
2:27:21
get and nobody's dying they're so far ahead that they didn't even need Aon honestly just keep pushing uh why not
2:27:29
Boo Boo come on bnk oh there we go okay they're going free Ni I I retract my
2:27:35
booze no I re wait okay so Diablo just it's
2:27:42
fine all right so they're just going to stick around They Don't Really Care uh they're not going to play safe at all they're actually maybe going to get more
2:27:49
kills here looking for way Kell's like hey I'll I'll I'll do it you can't stop
2:27:55
me he's demoting them I think CLA wins this well I I
2:28:01
actually I think for CLA we're getting we're getting pretty close did you see the damage from the tase he might he
2:28:07
might want to go down like his buff is about to time out just die it's fine no he he's just
2:28:14
going to survive okay oh that was that was tight I don't know how many seconds he had
2:28:19
left left him that buff I mean now it's you know there he was dragging them he's going back into position to kill
2:28:27
them and I think bdd might just get away um but it was funny anyway I think that
2:28:33
CLE he's going to pretend like he still has the buff and he's going to continue to run at them and say okay guys come on
2:28:39
the game's over come on just just FF it's over uh go next we are ready the
2:28:46
casters are ready the teams are ready like KT they're not going to go down without a fight though that's a lot of
2:28:52
damage on to Kellen and those turrets you can't just quite tank them as much here comes diao Unleashed again and
2:28:58
that's 1,000 gold he just dies gigachad wait uh KT going to just get 1,000 gold
2:29:06
on Duck Dom end perfect I think it was uh are they
2:29:13
going to get Soul point off of this uh did they just throw did I just that they might okay
2:29:20
that's not a cter curse I didn't think it was possible no I'm like this game is over the casters know it's over the
2:29:27
teams know it's over what Diablo did just skate over an Nexus while the turrets will still maybe maybe I might
2:29:34
control them to do it well that's a a very powerful mind control Val I feel like that's more a better explanation
2:29:40
than what we saw yeah they could have just they could have done a lot of
2:29:46
things they could have gone for Drake they could have just waited for the wave but they did not n of those uh and and
2:29:52
usually he takes aggro so if anyone else has Agro like that play works out fine
2:29:58
but now they get a triple on dock they got the S this this still shouldn't
2:30:04
matter okay I'm just going to they should be able to get Baron two it's
2:30:09
down but it is that is the start of a very funny gold craft if it happens yeah
2:30:15
we might go full LPL here I mean we've got respawning Nexus turrets as well well uh there ways back we is definitely
2:30:24
dead he's going to find a way to get out of this one he is Poppy and the way out is Flash never
2:30:32
mind he's fine he has unlocked his hex flash he is now ready to use
2:30:37
it it's kind of heartbreaking that ddom got a triple and he still doesn't have a third item whereas diao is sitting on he
2:30:44
also got a th000 gold shutdown yeah no I know and and the Apple's sitting on a lot
2:30:50
so KT I mean they're they're just trying to stop this Baron from going down as that is a big combo but that front line
2:30:56
is very tanky but as you mention kronic they just don't have any damage they still don't have any damage Here Comes
2:31:02
via he is going so incredibly deep for this one with the wall and he is going to trap cuz as that will go bdd we've
2:31:10
got cuz in a bad spot here too and finally tble he is going to find his moments to actually make the right call
2:31:17
and dive as far as he possibly can the game is now over it was in fact
2:31:23
uncurable and we will be moving on to game three in the series between B and K and KT to the surprise of
2:31:30
nobody what a game fell this oh I'm going to I'm going to remember this one
2:31:36
for for many reasons is it for uh Diablo the good parts is it for diao the bad
2:31:42
parts is it KT taking an incredible game number one then having a draft that makes go I'm not so sure about that and
2:31:49
then uh getting completely bopped it might be all of those things but I do
2:31:54
want to highlight if bnk win this and the expected favored T1 wins as well
2:32:00
then all of a sudden grou Baron on the verge of securing a lead in the LSK
2:32:07
cup yeah I mean they would definitely have a lead if those two teams did go ahead they wouldn't be on the verge of
2:32:13
it it would be three to one all right for group Baron most unhinged between lazy field Berserker and Diablo I don't
2:32:19
think it's Berserker I know he was very aggressive but it still felt like there was controls it's got to be aggression I
2:32:26
think it is Dia based on what we've seen especially because now we've kind of seen Diablo in a winning game as well
2:32:33
where he was even further even more Unleashed than we thought was even
2:32:39
possible and scores got a lot to say about this one
2:32:44
unsurprisingly coaching staff over there just uh not very happy with the way this one played out BD still did a lot of
2:32:51
damage cuz he's Victor but he also died a lot and it was not a very pretty game
2:32:56
for him yeah VI with the tank build he's just there to support the friends around
2:33:01
him he doesn't really need to do a whole lot and he was the main character in that one valis that was
2:33:07
diao and Diablo did his job he Dove over and over and over again after he had
2:33:13
that early Zer moment on the grubs and that's going to do it for game two we'll be back after the space in game three
2:34:12
you
2:35:17
J
2:35:42
hello Summoners welcome to the 2025 lck League format explainer the league is
2:35:48
entering an exciting new chapter packed with changes that will take the competition to the next level don't
2:35:55
worry though we'll be here to take you through everything you need to know so the first and biggest change is that the
2:36:01
LSK is moving to a single season format so no longer will we have spring and summer splits but instead we'll have one
2:36:08
continuous season and at the end of the year we will have only a single team crowned season Champion which means that
2:36:15
every single match that is played right from the beginning has a lot more impact and every team will be fighting for that
2:36:22
ultimate title before the regular season kicks off we'll have the lck cup this preseason tournament not only sets the
2:36:29
stage for the year but also serves as the qualifier for the first International Tournament scheduled for March here's how it all plays out the ls
2:36:36
cup begins with what we call the group battle so the 10 ls teams are divided into two groups and the top two teams
2:36:43
from last season will each anchor a group and then they take turns choosing who joins their group group yes the
2:36:50
teams themselves will decide their competition and once the groups are set the teams will play against the other
2:36:56
group in a single round robin format that's awesome when the dust settles the
2:37:02
results determine two key groups the winnner group and the losers group the
2:37:07
top three teams from the winners group Advance straight to the playoffs while everyone else heads to the play-ins the
2:37:14
playin will then determine the final seeds for the semi double elimination playoffs at the end of it all one team
2:37:20
will be crowned lck Cup champion and earn a ticket to the first International Tournament of the Year
2:37:29
extravagance after the lck cup and the first International Tournament the regular season begins the regular season
2:37:35
is divided into two phases the first phase consists of rounds one and two held before the MSI mid-season
2:37:42
tournament during this phase all 10 teams will play a double round robin format over N9 weeks at the end of these
2:37:49
rounds the top six teams advaned what we're calling the road to MSI the road to MSI is a special five round King of
2:37:56
the Hill format teams battle it out to determine the two lck representatives
2:38:02
for MSI it's fast high stakes and a perfect warm-up for the international
2:38:07
stage amazing after MSI the regular season resumes with around three four
2:38:13
and five teams will be split into two groups based on their standing so far we'll have the legend group featuring
2:38:19
The Top teams and the rise group where the remaining teams compete each group
2:38:24
will play a triple Round Rob in best of free format with every single match adding to the tension as we approach the
2:38:30
playoffs super cool once the regular season ends we enter the playoffs but
2:38:35
before the playoffs proper there's one last hurdle the play-ins the fifth place team from the Legend group and the top
2:38:42
three teams from the rise group will compete for the final two playoff spots this stage features five T best of five
2:38:49
match matches so expect some incredible games the playoffs themselves adopt a full double elimination format starting
2:38:55
right from round one that's a big change from previous years where losing early could mean instant elimination so now
2:39:02
every team gets a second chance ensuring that the best truly rise to the top the
2:39:08
top two teams from The Legend group get a buy into round two while everyone else battles from round one at the end of it
2:39:15
all the LC Champion is crowned and with it they secure the top seed for worlds
2:39:21
speaking of Worlds there's another big change for 2025 unfortunately there will no longer be a regional qualifier but
2:39:28
instead your path to Worlds is determined entirely by the lck playoffs so where you finish in the playoffs
2:39:34
determines your spot on the global stage simple clear and more competitive than
2:39:40
ever so that's the new lck format for 2025 from the high stakes lck cup to an
2:39:45
expanded regular season and a revamped playoff system this year promises to deliver more action more strategy and
2:39:52
more Unforgettable moments than ever before see you on the rift
2:40:31
thanks to the guys for that super cool explanation video on the 2025 lck season
2:40:38
we're here one to one as KT cannot close it on out and bnk FX find a way to make
2:40:45
an even more dominant Victory here in this series between these two squads Deon alongside oxen W did and uh jent
2:40:53
that was yet again another very one-sided game yeah I feel like kg kind
2:40:58
of thinking they were playing TFT with the Arcane composition but it kind of didn't really come together not really
2:41:05
uh and also like we saw I mean to me the thing that really makes sense is it had like the Jace and the Caitlyn and
2:41:11
clearly the intent with these picks is to get early lead but the early Lane assignments kind of didn't really work
2:41:17
out for that regard cuz we ended up with this swap situation where you have Caitlyn poppy into Cante re and you just
2:41:24
can't really get that much pressure I also think you know we often see the c p with like something like a Lo to really stomp Lane you didn't get that H and
2:41:31
then we end up with a zeri against the Jace and um yeah I'm not sure this is
2:41:36
supposed to happen but it's it's not ideal and I think it's especially funny that the flash was kind of misplayed the
2:41:43
shock B still hit and dble still won yeah I mean he got hit by every single spells but he still managed to to kill
2:41:49
Jay somehow and then I think this kind of Accel accelerated the game uh to bnk
2:41:56
because I mean KT should have win the laning phase should have win the oi game but they have the JS at Caitlyn but they
2:42:03
somehow lose the O game and then that kind of sbles the game towards bnk side yeah and good to see diao after a couple
2:42:10
of very high-profile mistakes in game number one stay aggressive and win in that 1 V one that could have completely
2:42:16
changed the way the game played out here I fact da just fits this team like the aggressive style that we've had from bnk
2:42:22
FX so much it's just he's locked in with them he's he's all in and I think this play is really good cuz we see the sync
2:42:28
engages Kellen stuns the poppy which allows Raptor to engage on the Caitlin H and that synced engage timing means the
2:42:35
poppy peel isn't there and it's dable who comes in with the cleanup on this Zer the initial engage is good but the
2:42:40
cleanup just means the game is over yeah and also this kind of shows that how a KT's team cup is really bad uh at the
2:42:47
same time is because uh when you see the bnk side it's really easy straight up uh Team comp because you just go in
2:42:54
together and then just press right clicks and then you kill everyone but uh KT side you have Caitlyn and Jay and
2:43:01
bigor but you have Poppy and zenzo which is like looking for uh some messy team
2:43:07
fights you know so I feel like KT team comp didn't work really well together so
2:43:12
that's why bnk drafted really well yeah and shout outs to Kellen and Raptor for making that play happen on the Wukong on
2:43:18
the realing ining it on up and then finally we have our last replay here oh sorry no we've got the gold difference
2:43:24
here between these two squads oh these games super snowbally and generally we expected things to be more snowbally
2:43:30
with like the feat of strength and stuff but these in different directions were just complete Stomps yeah when you think
2:43:36
about the lck whenever you are winning the oi game you were not doing anything that much but this patch you have the
2:43:42
new Rift and new objectives right so you have so many things to do on the rift when you're ahead in the early game so I
2:43:48
think that's why that's uh really snowball nowadays yeah and we have so this is the moment they had the attam
2:43:54
buff the revives they went in they died this is pretty part of the course this is pretty what we expect yeah but I
2:44:00
think the Hallmark cuz every other team they get the buff they're like now it's time to be aggressive I feel like being
2:44:05
K fax they're just aggressive like the buff is kind of like oh we actually revive when we die cool it's an
2:44:11
afterthought cuz they lose the buff and then like they make a play that you
2:44:17
would only expect to see from team that have the buff where I mean Dao you know I love him but a little bit over
2:44:25
aggressive I mean they could end the game here definitely but uh as you mentioned they don't care about the
2:44:31
atakan they don't care if they have buff or not they are just fear X they're just going in that's what their team color is
2:44:38
see Champion kill Champion it's that simple yes that's why I like their play style and also the team comp wise I
2:44:44
think Ru kind of build up they already know their team kala and they know how uh when they're good so I feel like
2:44:51
their team comp is always like really team fight around and also putting Dia on the hyper Ed cares yeah live by the
2:44:58
fearlessness die by the fearlessness as we take a look at the Fearless draft results so far these are the 10
2:45:04
Champions or the 20 Champions that have been played cannot be played anymore what sticks out of you ax here for
2:45:09
something that hasn't been picked Jack maybe a power pick here for game number three as we take a look at KT uh I mean
2:45:15
I can't think of anything specifically off the top of my head I know like the Sani didn't get really a looky we talked about that in game one but I feel like
2:45:21
having that early pressure has been really important for these teams so if something does end up going through like maybe the varus the kist that will
2:45:28
definitely be snapped up it feels like the early pressure as we've seen both games I mean snowball has been a massive
2:45:34
Factor all right well that music means it's time to get ourselves back to the rift for the deciding game here again
2:45:40
group Elder and group Baron all the teams up and down those rosters hoping for a win for their side who will get it
2:45:46
let's find out as we send it back on over to the casters for game number three thank you spacers for that
2:45:53
wonderful breakdown yes we'll have to wait and see if Sani makes it but honestly after the ban in game two and
2:45:59
the fact that now we've had 20 Champions that are also Perma bands um alongside of the new bands that we're going to
2:46:05
have here in game three I think we might be digging deeper than you know some of those very op Champions uh that we
2:46:12
have't seen band so far so very curious uh to see what does make it across the line you know Cante Bann in game one
2:46:19
played in game two so we don't get to see him thankfully we don't get to see tank Jace
2:46:24
anymore maybe next season uh maybe next series hopefully next season maybe next
2:46:30
season or maybe not in that season either but how about in the next series
2:46:35
might happen we'll see going have to wait for a while
2:46:41
longer because BK bring us to a game number three although depending on your
2:46:47
feelings on KT might be feeling like anything that happens just is their fault or you know their effort which
2:46:55
they have even me who generally doesn't believe in curses sometimes KT just
2:47:01
seems like they have a sort of mystical Aura around them as the vehicle going to get taken away but you're the best
2:47:08
Caster cursor out of the the whole tal aren't real vas we talked about this many times but you still are the best at
2:47:15
Caster cursing so I don't know how that works I don't I don't that's that's confirmation bias it's not real it's
2:47:21
fine we don't have to get into this all discussion again cuz it's only jungle V does far vgo knockturn taken off the
2:47:27
table scarner as well continuing the uh Banning of scarner by being kale though
2:47:32
in this case they're on red side so that makes a lot more sense Sani is still open I would imagine that
2:47:41
that one is taken away cuz it is one of the still higher prioritized Champs that
2:47:47
is up and I if we're taking VI away as well I don't think KT should I think KT
2:47:52
should just look to first pick it because cuz is all it or leave it open and cuz picks nly because that is an
2:47:59
amazing matchup and cuz absolutely dunks on people on that champion and Bessa
2:48:04
also available here I I think we might have to ban that instead which means that KT rollster in a really good spot
2:48:10
to potentially first pick Sani it it kind of leaves you in a hard spot maybe you leave them both open and
2:48:16
you say okay well at least we'll get one but I feel like with the two Essa bands in the first couple of games you would
2:48:23
imagine yep it's going to be a kalista band so now we've got both Amba and sejuani available for game
2:48:32
three most likely a trade of those I would prefer the ambassa pick up cuz
2:48:37
again I think KT either cuz ends up playing nly or he ends up playing sichani and I think he's happy either
2:48:43
way but NOP going to be the prioritization on that s for cuz and it
2:48:50
does make sense we've seen this player be exceptional at the pick for a long long time now being K what is going to
2:48:57
be their answer Rapture with the role that he plays on the team I don't really see him playing something like the N we
2:49:05
have the Mala already taken away because was played in game number one so we'll see what the answer is going to be as
2:49:13
ambessa here for CLA or via you go probably our best ambassa performance so
2:49:18
so far and that was from the mid lane going to be an early prioritization for Kellen on the
2:49:24
raan are we are we are we Zing is that where we're we are in game three L that's so
2:49:31
sad well might be asreal Diablo got to play kaisa and Zer and got a lot of fans
2:49:38
by his absolute wackiness I'm sure he can find a way to play Zia aggressively vas I just don't want him to play Zia at
2:49:46
all uh the ja is good it's great alongside of the zani and we
2:49:51
get to see BD's air so this is something that we were talking about at the beginning of the day is that bdd and cuz's champo is very deep B doesn't have
2:49:59
to go that deep getting uh zir for game number three it's not extremely meta but
2:50:04
it's extreme comfort for him and it's hard to be associated with
2:50:10
air in a league where you know Faker and chovi are also playing but bdd somehow
2:50:16
still manages to do so as there is the Zia locked in got to be ad carry BS from
2:50:22
here and out the Ezreal to me seems like a no-brainer and there it is and what is the other ban going to be
2:50:30
because you can either ban away something aggressive the Draven comes to mind or he can ban away like aios I
2:50:37
don't even think Champion is good but just cuz it's Doom you know what they should ban is zigs yes 100% they should
2:50:43
ban Z it's a lot of magic damage but zigs is fantastic into Zia oh yeah and
2:50:49
I it really just comes down to can duckon play it or is Ox going to have another aneurysm um those really the
2:50:56
only two options uh but I I think that's a decent shot I mean there's you're
2:51:02
really going deep into the S carry champ pool now with all these
2:51:07
bands we'll have to see no Varys no kalista no EZ Jinx still available as
2:51:14
well Lucian going to get taken off the board zigs is looking pretty juicy but it does mean as you
2:51:20
were saying that if they end up picking up something like I mean I don't expect anyone in the
2:51:27
El SK play a mundo but imagine playing into uh into a lineup like is on KT if
2:51:35
they do end up going for the zix we'll see what actually ends up being the lock in here jungle ban most likely here it's
2:51:42
going to be the silus instead taken away so not want to give that one to Via vla
2:51:48
I do recall also one of the type of players that do really seems to thrive on melee characters akali however is
2:51:55
still open so if he's not going to be picking that wouldn't be surprised to see that picked up do they want to do
2:52:00
that here though or secure a jungler for Raptor might want to leave it out up until the end and there it is indeed the
2:52:07
aali is going to get picked up here by a via that's a really good call I mean Ki
2:52:13
was a very strong answer into azir for many patches and VI is the exact type type of player so you call it crony that
2:52:20
is a great spot here's the Jinx you know you were talking about this as well you if you do not want to play something
2:52:26
like aak you've already got that air you can just go for the Jinx and and
2:52:31
try to battle it out in terms of hyper carry versus Hyper carry there in the
2:52:38
bottom side and duck Dom definitely can pilot this looking to uh go alongside of
2:52:47
the Lulu you know he was part of that AOS uh AOS Lulu Jinx Lulu kind of meta
2:52:52
that we used to have oh jarvin raon sign me up into Jinx Lulu in
2:53:00
particular when the flash is down that is going to be very tough to play out
2:53:06
the obvious downside of this is that the composition for B andk is going to be very well on how can they play in mid
2:53:13
game because if you don't get either the aali or the Essa in a good position you can Team fight with the comp but I think
2:53:19
that if you are KT you're going to be feeling a lot more comfortable you have engag with the sejuani you have a really strong front to back setup you have a
2:53:26
lot of safety that you can create for your Jinx but the early the mid game skirmishes outside of the Jack Sani
2:53:33
which obviously is insanely threatening I'm looking at Raptor I think he actually has a lot of agency to make
2:53:39
some big moves here in the early game and on the Wukong he was definitely able to do so KT though if they can get
2:53:45
through the early laning phase unscathed not give up too many of objectives kind of slow down the pace that front to back
2:53:51
is going to be disgusting yeah it definitely will be um you know azir Jinx what year is
2:53:57
it I don't know anymore but uh it still does the same thing and uh they've also
2:54:04
got Jacks and you have Lulu so just scale just wait you know feat of strength what are those that's fake
2:54:10
doesn't matter just be ready to fight for vicious Aon or maybe not just maybe give that up and wait until you're ready
2:54:16
a little bit later on and just win team fights later on in the game we saw that happen yesterday and win you can do it
2:54:23
with this comp that's for sure KT cuz going to do to do a lot of
2:54:29
heavy lifting when it comes to getting into that mid to late game this comp doesn't really scream power a little bit laning face power from that Lulu but
2:54:35
outside of that early skirmishes they're going to have to be careful if they can get to the team fights without getting this aali fed without having Raptor
2:54:42
having too much impact they should be good but after game two little worried vales yeah we'll have to wait and see as
2:54:48
we hop on the rift for game number
2:55:04
three and here we go game number three and already bnk invading the jungle a
2:55:11
little bit getting some Vision down checking the tri Bush as well as three just
2:55:18
going to see what the start is going to be for cuz if they can via still raming around
2:55:27
down here on the bottom side of the map will eventually go to Mid looks like standard Lane assignments
2:55:34
was wondering whether maybe bnk wanted to look for a swap Lulu can
2:55:42
be kind of obnoxious if you're not able to find an early window and to really
2:55:47
fren her and obviously with the zy raon duo I'm going to have as much power as with some
2:55:53
of the other setups that we've seen raan if it was raan kalista for example you be feeling very differently but Z has
2:55:59
been not very popular I think for a reason I haven't really seen the champion have a lot of success as we
2:56:05
take a look at the mid set up here yeah there we go yeah that's why uh I be
2:56:12
feeling a little bit scared if you are the Alo and kir both heals used and it doesn't look like Rapture wants to go
2:56:18
for any crazy level two Shenanigans and which you can do of course driving as far as level two
2:56:23
gankers goes is one of the best that we still have as a champion in the game but not going to be the
2:56:30
case yeah I I think that Raptor might be one of those guys that would consider it
2:56:35
oh yeah most of our junglers would just be like n I'm not I'm not doing that but yeah not going to go for it just going
2:56:41
to be playing it standard so Thea uh it was picked face up right they didn't
2:56:46
know what they were playing into in the bottom Lane but with the Recon pickup we were very much expecting it and so it
2:56:54
gets picked and that just allows KT to form this very ex not even just very
2:56:59
extremely solid uh matchup in the bottom Lane also match up for the rest of the
2:57:04
game as well I I feel like Jinx can kind of just do what Z does but a bit better
2:57:10
uh if she's given enough time that is and uh certainly in this Lane you're going to be given a lot of
2:57:16
time and that goes back to Rapture needing to have a big impact can be through GS can be through objective
2:57:22
setup but do think that they are going to be relying on him to either fix some of these Lane States via obviously just
2:57:28
once to gets to level six very desperately at that point you can start actually contesting the wave and
2:57:33
threatening bdd if you manage to land a shrien flip not going to be the case
2:57:39
just yet as gain not going to have his W available but again Dives are a lot
2:57:45
harder if this was the old turrets maybe cuz would have looked of something off the back of that trade but now I don't
2:57:51
think you really can also picked up his Scuttle and should be looking to base
2:57:57
here as we see Raptor has already done yeah you see he is the SK Bloom and he
2:58:03
doesn't care about giving way his position as we got a big trade up here on the top side and Bessa can of course
2:58:10
do that whenever she wants um you know he gives away his position and he doesn't care about the bnk bottom Lane
2:58:16
knowing that he's there because both sides know that he's not diving like it's just not it's not going to happen
2:58:23
um maybe if it was a bit more of a stacked wave and more aggressive bottom Lane something like that but even then
2:58:29
nowadays it's not really happening as we have seen I think it was also cuz his Ward that actually ends up being nice
2:58:36
for doam here so what happened there Kal is backing looked like Dia was going to join the back which of course was our re
2:58:42
you can do wasn't actually what ended up happening diao ended up canceling because dockham kept pushing so so I
2:58:48
again I think it was cuz might have been way but I'm pretty sure cuz dropped the ward as he was leaving that Tri brush
2:58:54
end up keeping alive and again for via the goal is to just not fall behind if he catches this full wave he's actually
2:59:01
on perfect parody so not going to be feeling too bad about anything and get to level six get a base in and from that
2:59:08
point on he can start making some impact on the map as that's very painful for the Apple
2:59:15
not going to be getting any of those doam hasn't backed yet has been able to build a small CS lead
2:59:21
here uh via might just die here flash comes forward but he's going to live bdd
2:59:26
not able to quite calculate that one perfectly and he could have just taken
2:59:32
the Flash and said okay that's enough but instead he wanted the kill H at least you know with via totally gone
2:59:39
from the mid lane he is going to TP back but this is a free dragon here for CZ to pick up early on in the game that's a
2:59:45
pretty big win for Via though BD also takes a turret shot as going to have to chug through his refillable and Via now
2:59:51
is going to ium ding six very shortly as his wave comes through this contest is
2:59:57
obviously not really going to be a thing most likely raptor is just going to use the PRI that clear as on top to
3:00:04
trade for the grubs and he had faded ashes as well I can understand that he
3:00:11
thought that he was going to have enough damage with the final Auto but not going to be the case Raptor now going to try
3:00:17
and trade the UPS no First Blood yet because of via surviving there yeah via surviving a lot of lanes
3:00:24
that aren't really getting too aggressive on each other outside of that one trade bit of trading in top side but
3:00:31
it's it's very much an even Lane State at this point in time and yeah just the grubs going to be
3:00:37
going over to bnk they will take all three of
3:00:42
those one to one when it comes to objectives
3:00:48
clarify that still it does still say 0 to zero in the top uh The Kills but it is also one to one in the series so
3:00:55
you're you're correct about that chronic that wasn't what I meant F but you're also correct about it well that's that's
3:01:02
nice I guess thanks yeah so far group Baron and group Elder one to one yeah
3:01:08
it's still an even score mhm yeah I I'm trying to think of more stuff
3:01:16
but I don't yeah no it's that that might I was thinking I think that was it exhausted it uh flash for Flash in mid
3:01:23
okay yeah that's that yeah okay I'll accept that teleport for teleport in top they're basically on the same
3:01:30
timer not quite the same timer in mid though no no it was desyn I I looked at that actually that wasn't one for one no
3:01:37
no no that was like one and then one yeah bit different count so as we are
3:01:45
seeing right now KT going to be feeling great about how this game has looked so far level six now starting to become
3:01:52
available Raptor W is and 0 carries flash is always going to be one of the most important Summoners in any single
3:02:00
game that's going to be Amplified by a million when you are a ad car without a
3:02:05
dashing playing it jarvin because the range from which he can get on top of you and lock you down is crazy and there
3:02:12
are so many Frets on bnk that are available Raptor going for a little bit of an invade here and this is the type
3:02:19
of situation where I would expect bnk to just look for any mid game Skirmish that
3:02:26
they can find where KT doesn't have a full setup because KT actually gets the setup in the traditional you know docks
3:02:32
in the back they have engage on someone they get the early reset for Jinx Lulu's
3:02:37
next to him I don't think you're really going to be able to do a whole lot you need to try and look for fights and skirmishes in Via looking for bdd there
3:02:45
this might be exactly the type of fight we're talking about it's a very weird one the ID carry is not really part of
3:02:50
this at all duck wasn't able to clear out the ward but also he zoned diao by
3:02:56
putting down some Chompers and yeah he saw him backing there so via just being a little bit
3:03:04
cheeky that was cute got the E then canceled BD's base and should now be able to maybe deny a little bit of Cs in
3:03:10
mid hey Kon what do you think the chances are of a runis Aon in this game uh well that's very easy zero cuz we no
3:03:18
action wait you summoned the action you're so good at the Caster cursing duck though is going to survive and cuz
3:03:26
comes in and says hello and that's about it but bnk will win the trade and now they've got via
3:03:32
coming down here maybe looking for an exit kill that really doesn't do a whole lot
3:03:38
they're zoning them off of the entire wave and the turret CZ really like that
3:03:44
was a really good timeing if he's not there Raptor at the very is getting a flash just with his old alone also happy
3:03:51
to report that the able did in fact go for his first old was an aggressive one expect to see more of that from him uh
3:03:57
you love to see it is now the lane swap comes through here cuz KT wants to deny
3:04:02
both six grubs cuz again we talked so much about the Feats six grubs is still crazy when you have any type of split
3:04:10
pushing pressure because it still allows you to chew for turrets in a matter of seconds so trying to deny that makes
3:04:15
sense but bnk have man matched the swap KT instead going to send doam and way to
3:04:22
Mid to take cryo there and now via changing his mind double TP almost available for the solo laners on either
3:04:29
side almost there for bnk already there for perfect and bdd we might have a 5v5 on our hands here
3:04:37
vales yeah I mean it definitely could happen I I feel like if you're bnk you are almost begging for it you know
3:04:43
you're like please fight over this objective K's level five though I think he really needs to hit six if they want
3:04:50
to go aggressive here there you go got of mid just standing in mid getting it
3:04:55
and I think you know one grub will go the way of KT here but Raptor gets on in there's that engage on a bdd but he just
3:05:01
flashes it and now we've got cousin A R Spot he's going to have to flash away in goes big CL just to die immediately way
3:05:09
too over aggressive say okay that's fine as they're looking to play front to back
3:05:15
here Kell getting low but in goes clear and he's Essa he's in there with all of
3:05:20
them as the jarvin traps everybody in this one oh the polymorph is huge on the clear actually will prevent bdd from
3:05:27
going down pretty dicey situation perfect thinking about a bit more and at
3:05:33
the end of the day you can see that diao you know he's at least able to tip away at perfect but we got a TP on the top
3:05:40
side via looking for a bit more everybody has already backed away bit of a mess across either side I'd say there
3:05:47
starts with via and the rest of the gang trying to go in on bdd so this knock up
3:05:53
from raptor is great Kellen investing I don't think was really the call and then
3:05:59
via's decision to follow up there great response from BD immediately he feels safe cuz he has the Shrout but then this
3:06:05
TP initially I think goes unnoticed clear ends up being there way earlier
3:06:11
then perfect is which means that that combo right there ends up I think winning the fight and then if clear just
3:06:18
decides to maybe play it a little bit slower there and gets the kill uh or rather
3:06:24
gets away with the rest of his team could have been a lot better now though uh grub only a single one was taken so
3:06:30
that objective is still on the board for KT teleports are used now across the board and I think most likely B and K
3:06:37
are just going to get the other two grubs and then try to also play to not give over the dragon and neither team
3:06:43
will get further along but because First Blood was found on Via KT still ahe throughout that whole
3:06:49
exchange yep always got to remember the feat strength and uh we got chronicler
3:06:54
right in front of me pointing at Duck Dom's flash as well so that's gone um we don't have Diablo flash but he's Z so
3:07:01
he's got at least a feather storm to survive a bit longer especially when you're going up against jarvin you really need that flash as you mentioned
3:07:07
earlier on KT trying to burst down the dragon you see that clear is here but he does not have Smite so I think you just
3:07:14
Smite it and try to get away that's really the question as y comes over the
3:07:20
wall clear continuing in on this one but KT just don't really want too much of
3:07:26
this at all they say okay we got the objective we get out cool ult but we've had enough for after
3:07:33
though should be able to stop some backs and be increasingly annoying Kellen here as well meanwhile it made Diablo's uh
3:07:41
I'm see on the going in two we'll see uh how that ends up going uh looks like he
3:07:47
is fine definitely uh showing some of his and that was a big mistake there about bnk because they were they got the
3:07:55
one grub so they've denied the objective but I think they thought that they could get the one grub then rotate fast enough
3:08:00
underestimated the damage from KT KT still got the dragon so second dragon now picked up it's a cloud Rift by the
3:08:07
way so Atlas going to be feeling great about that one and the good thing for
3:08:12
bnk is that diao is looking uh quite fed the bad news is that neither nor CLE
3:08:18
really seems to have been able to Cle was so close to getting that kill via was not quite as close could have been
3:08:25
big for how they play out the S side Lanes it's going to be a bit harder now although clear might be able to get
3:08:30
first tur blood here which means that the race is still on for those Feats
3:08:36
Valas yeah chopping away at this one thank you jarvin standard for giving us attack speed
3:08:42
yeah Jin's kit is uh it's very simple but it's it's also
3:08:49
got like a lot of little things in it as well I love jarin man it's like and it's also one of the very early created
3:08:55
character you know generally we meme like okay it's a new character it's got like a full novel you have to read to
3:09:01
understand it but J you he's got a little a lot of little things in his kit yeah I really like him as far as both
3:09:07
he's still and we are in a third game of fearless but it feels like as soon as eMobile 8 carries get a little bit too
3:09:14
popular he's always on the verge of making a comeback we still be high PRI pick in Worlds 2023 so even in the recent era of League
3:09:23
KT I still think that they're feeling great as long as they can get to a position where dockum gets a second item
3:09:28
bdd gets a second item and perfect doesn't really look like anyone is going to match him in the side at any point in
3:09:36
this game they going to be feeling good but they need to be careful because this is the type of comp where if bdd or dock
3:09:43
Miss positions once and they actually do get on the backline you can also lose the game no matter how good your
3:09:50
position is so definitely going to be a very tense game from here and out valis
3:09:55
and it's also by far the closest one that we've gone so far between these two yeah between these
3:10:01
two uh I mean I feel like at the end of the day if you're KT or just kind of sitting back you're scaling it's not like the
3:10:08
old you know air reaon as real Tom kench where don't don't remind me I remember
3:10:16
bdd on geni yeah you're just sitting there and you could scale or you could
3:10:22
just beat them over the head in the lane anyway uh with all of your very powerful
3:10:28
Champions um man Tom can support W devour was a was an ARA yeah cuz is here
3:10:36
and Diablo doesn't really do damage yet he just has a ER and a Zeal so he kind
3:10:42
of hanging out setting up Herold here is bnk
3:10:48
looks like they got a good chunk of damage on already via is in a flank position level two on the ultimate this
3:10:54
could be good for being K but KT aren't afraid duck has to flash away from the
3:10:59
ambessa as now we has to flash over to his ad8 carry just trying to fight front
3:11:05
to back but it's it's painful as the El comes in on a Kellen nobody does anything to Kellen after that old hits
3:11:11
him so very messy fighting reengage comes in and now we got the followup
3:11:16
here the aggressive Evol but immediately diao will be punished for that perfect takes him out as it is a two for two for
3:11:23
so far via trying to get back in trying to get out now actually is cuz looking for the Chase and he will have the
3:11:29
freeze that's a double kill for bdd and it will be KT barely getting across the line and Diablo does go for another
3:11:37
aggressive H but unfortunately for him that's also what ends up being his
3:11:42
demise it's perfect there with the Timely rival that ends up solidifying
3:11:50
this fight as a win for p and I think that when they saw their own health bars they knew must have known that this was
3:11:55
a risk so initially things look good diac can't actually get onto the backline nice hold from Wade there to cancel the e meaning that cuz stays
3:12:02
alive but they get Dock's Flash and that ends up being the herald of great
3:12:07
disaster as his mana's low the teleport comes in and still bnk say no we can
3:12:13
make this happen but look at how little damage they actually is on dock arm and
3:12:19
the fact that the Apple doesn't find the flash perfect just blitzes
3:12:24
him if either of those things don't happen maybe this is a win but bnk with those hellers must have known that they
3:12:30
were taking a risk and instead a huge win for KT as they get the herald and
3:12:35
win the fight yeah uh we were reminded by Gyan that in his interview Dia um he
3:12:41
said you know high risk High reward is my Play style y uh very much high risk
3:12:46
not much reward uh that time around but you know he's had a lot of big rewards
3:12:51
so far in the series so credit where credit is due but this time around that aggressive alt and no flash just means
3:12:58
you know it's really going to change the way that that that that fight plays out especially when you're being can you want to take these fights as much as you
3:13:06
possibly can I was about to say I I would imagine that KT is going to contest it they did invest a Teleport
3:13:12
though we'll see this is a moment where bnk can either try and really get a foo
3:13:19
hold in this game as uh we going aggressive on Doom here okay uh Kellen he pressed his Z
3:13:27
button for some reason so did clear well they got Drake I'm sure they
3:13:32
have their own reasons I just don't know what they are but we're not meant to know anything though us we're just watching the game yeah so duck was like
3:13:40
really far under the turret there and they really wanted to make sure he was punished for sticking around and trying
3:13:45
to kill the turret in instead they used two alts and hit nothing and looked very silly I don't know if this is true but
3:13:52
in my head even though Diablo is you know he's 17 he's quite young looks pretty uh pretty young as well in the
3:13:58
com he's like we can kill him we can kill him we can kill him go go go this is not based on facts just based on how
3:14:04
that play defitely happens I could see it look at the vision control here towards the B side of the map as well by
3:14:09
the way from KT didn't end up getting the dragon but I think did make that whole secret of play feel kind of weird
3:14:16
cuz I think FX BK were trying to look for a possible catching them of guard and then
3:14:23
uh they were very much on guard didn't really work out as via this aali needs to have an impact in this game even if
3:14:30
it's just a single kill onto dock on because otherwise this Pi doesn't do anything right has one job which is
3:14:36
threaten or at the very least Zone the backline and instead perfect obviously
3:14:41
in the 1 V one I don't think the aali expect to do a lot but even in the fights feel like VI's just been going in
3:14:47
and going down yeah I mean you got to wait for some items to come online I guess but
3:14:54
especially with a very iffy early game and the fact that uh azir has had a a
3:15:01
much more fun time it just feels like you're not really that that a colie pick
3:15:06
isn't really doing what it's meant to do we'll see if he can get some assassinations a little bit later on I
3:15:11
feel like the Jinx and especially the Lulu was just really fantastic into what we already saw
3:15:17
on the side of bnk and by that time it was like well bnk had to commit to it right and they go for
3:15:24
the j4 as their R5 pick right so I the
3:15:30
has so much value it does yeah even when you trying to jump on top of the back line right Lulu can uh just especially
3:15:37
now you press Redemption press heal press out even if you do catch Doom it's going to be tough and KT even though the
3:15:44
gold looks even I think our quite favored from this point on the game isn't won by any means and a catch
3:15:51
like this might be perfect undoing just going to try to flash it but can he
3:15:56
Flash the aalii he can't he doesn't have it anymore he's not getting any help from his team no TPS coming in this is a
3:16:03
two-on-one perfect just trying to hop around a bunch but you're not getting away from these two so just trying to
3:16:10
waste as much time as possible oh Raptor here's the flank not in range the
3:16:17
was close and what could have been if they actually get the flashh from dck them
3:16:23
there maybe a setup for Aon ends up just being a kill it's nice but not really going to be the turn around although
3:16:29
that is Shadow flame now done for Via so that is a big spike that was found and I don't think either team should do Aon
3:16:35
here I think we should just let it sit there and wait until we win the team fight because neither team seems like
3:16:41
they're far enough ahead to do this without incurring a pretty huge risk of
3:16:46
speed DD that's is that that's the first time right Rift maker is
3:16:53
there I've seen a lot of battle Rumble I I feel like you know the days
3:16:59
of tank air I feel like maybe one of those games yeah yeah oh yeah grasp tank air yeah probably would have seen it in
3:17:05
some some of those builds so been a while yeah pretty
3:17:12
interesting leandre's and oh he's doing a lot of damage to Ken
3:17:17
so I I don't think he's going to be feeling too bad we do have some setup being attempted here by bnk could also
3:17:25
be that their call is to just try and force a fight get Doom's Flash and then look for a re-engage but getting his
3:17:32
flash easier set than done and we're we're really seeing again like
3:17:38
Zia we're going to have to actually see diao be able to pop off in a team fight before we are convinced because now it
3:17:45
feels like getting effective ranges hard doom and BD both are going to just be able to poke you out perfect he's going
3:17:53
to be found here but this time feels a little safer has a bit more fog to work
3:17:59
with yeah he definitely does um you know the one thing I'll say is that this Z
3:18:04
different from the others this one is of course engage Zia true um different from you know the the scaling kind of waiting
3:18:11
a little bit passive Z that we see here in the lck generally diao is a different kind of Beast
3:18:17
I mean even movement ter like I can W up there are so many times where he's like
3:18:23
I'm going to engage uh yeah oh that's a good chunk uh
3:18:28
ster is doneo here for Raptor and he also has Sun so couple of AOS will get him into fighting shape vla will get
3:18:36
spotted by the wave here is this the opportunity we're waiting for Clear is there as well I mean there's just massive flanks from both sides the
3:18:42
Redemption but the AL comes in Duck do and the engage from diaa as well but
3:18:47
duck is alive they don't take him out and now the JX oh the combo does come in
3:18:53
but it's a little bit too little too late from the side of raptor and now clear is getting run down we've got via
3:18:59
as well kind of hidden in the jungle and KT just thinking okay do we just
3:19:05
continue to chase the ambessa or do we just take via down kind of a funky spot
3:19:11
but this should be some objectives here for the set of KT they will take down
3:19:16
this Cloud Drake at least and bnk thought that that was the opportunity they've been looking for but
3:19:22
unfortunately for the KT were ready they saw it coming and let's take another
3:19:28
look here so they are able to get on top of duck pretty early on the catch there absolutely beautiful but diao goes for
3:19:37
the aggressive flash but doam is still able to flash out bdd finds the knock back and then perect is right on top of
3:19:43
him and the rest of the team clear via these Champions aren't tanky enough to
3:19:50
just stand there and take the hit it's the Saving Grace is the fact that Raptor does actually get the kill on dock to
3:19:56
not make it a complete disaster but still look at the gold swing that is now there for KT I do want to remind you
3:20:03
though as long as that flash for duck is down bnk still have a fighting shot I think one more lost fight and the game
3:20:09
is over right out of Baron or ticon gets given up the map falls apart and KT all
3:20:15
they need to do is just make sure and at this point even if doop dies like do you even lose the fight bdd is 5 and zero
3:20:22
Perfect's fed I don't know I I don't yeah I don't think so I I think
3:20:29
they're just way too fed at this point in time like should there's just so many carries so many so much scaling we're 26
3:20:35
minutes into the game cuz is just going to catch Raptor as the damage comes in Duck going to take him that vas totally
3:20:41
alone he's just going to be cleaned up it's free it's just free food for k T
3:20:48
and I mean what are you going to do against bdd as well his positioning has been 10 out of 10 perfect in this game
3:20:56
it's one of the things you got to know about air it's not always about the flash he plays he's just right on top of Duck Down the entire time cuz sets up
3:21:03
the first kill he's ready for Via on the flank it was kind of a a sad flank from via but either way it's just perfect for
3:21:10
KT no perfect the top laner as Aon is going to take on KT yeah let me this one
3:21:17
time sorry you got me the the although that fight I think was lost the moment
3:21:22
that Raptor got caught we had an instant polymor so what via was looking there
3:21:27
was get over the wall and then get into his shroud and he just wasn't able to so here thek raptor is the tankiest member
3:21:35
on the team so someone has to stand in front unfortunately uh they can just engage onto him and he just dies doesn't
3:21:41
actually get look at that yeah beautiful that polymorph takes
3:21:46
away the one angle that they had because maybe if like vicla one Taps him and then the rest of the team I don't know I
3:21:53
think it was a stretch the moment that we saw those early fights in that mid lane play not working out but now feels
3:21:59
like KT should just be cruising towards the expected victory in a bit more strenuous matter than maybe was expected
3:22:06
but they are KT so are you really ever surprised no no no you're not I mean I I
3:22:13
really thought that KT would be able to to beat themselves by two zeroing bnk
3:22:20
today that was my official prediction but yeah they lost game too somehow and
3:22:27
now we're back to the regular scheduled programming it is KT beating them over the head with their gigantic wallets and
3:22:34
just looking to push the bottom Lane they got the Aon they got the baron and that is a deadly combo because you've
3:22:40
got all this pushing power which just makes diving that much easier right so that's exactly what they're going to
3:22:46
look to do they're looking for Raptor they do get onto bdd but immediately the Lulu the Lulu Al comes in and bdd finds
3:22:53
a bit of an ALT kind of wonky actually looking pretty good for bnk perfect is
3:22:58
so tanky and so fed at this point in time not the greatest fight here for KT
3:23:03
though duck is going to get excited he's got a couple of kills the penta angle is
3:23:09
alive and well but everybody just going to spread out and avoid him to deny it and he still got the aacon buff
3:23:16
yeah they got fresh teleports coming in They're Not Afraid bdd has rejoined the fry and KT about to take the two zeroes
3:23:25
I know the Nexus has fallen yet but as long as do Dom is standing delay pent doesn't matter yeah no
3:23:32
ah the soldier just Bonks a coli over the head that's the end of that one another double kill for bdd and that'll
3:23:39
be two games one here in the best of three for KT rollster they take it down
3:23:45
they get a victory for group Elder as well and yeah game
3:23:51
two kind of weird but it's okay you go back to the drawing board you you redo your
3:23:57
drafts you know it's Fearless it's new it's bnk they're very aggressive you got CL out shout out to them they made a
3:24:04
very fun series as well bnk I think as the KT in their own right and they will
3:24:10
be the winners tonight the more things change the more they stay the same uh KT somehow is still Their Own Worst Enemy
3:24:15
bnk will go in uh be it successfully or unsuccessfully and the winner of today
3:24:23
going to be both at least for this first series both uh group Elder and KT
3:24:29
perfect I think also having a lovely performance on two Champions that we saw
3:24:34
him perform on very well last year as well both the Renekton and the J
3:24:40
actually doing a lot of heavy lifting is I mean for bnk I think they can still be relatively healthy getting the win there
3:24:47
having that great game number two still for me was probably above what I expected from them let dock down back in
3:24:54
the lck shooting some arrows yeah he uh
3:24:59
he did play The Ash in game one I love we man he's such a good vibe as
3:25:06
well he he's great I I do love we and uh so that says you know every time I come
3:25:13
to wall park they lose basically 0% when rate when I am watching in the studio so
3:25:19
they have broken that which is what she was asking for they have broken that lost
3:25:24
streak and uh yeah not too surprising I I feel like for KT this should be
3:25:30
finnally enough the easiest matchup I think for them out of the teams that they will have to face from group Baron
3:25:37
so we'll see how the rest of this group stage looks for them take a look at some of the fights
3:25:43
that we had definitely the closest game a lot more back and forth there were a couple of key moments diao here I didn't
3:25:50
even notice the first time but actually ended up I think flashing into the Jack Counter Strike moments like that I think
3:25:57
engage as much as I I love that he's going that aggressive another example
3:26:03
here definitely is going to his flash this time okay but I think even if he flash is there I don't think in this
3:26:09
fight I don't really think could change the out cuz again perfect positioning there just wonderful wonder if when they
3:26:16
made that coal uh the teleport was just about to be channeled look at BD's positioning here yeah he is on top of
3:26:21
duck do and he says no and as a
3:26:27
result they don't even get dock Dom even if they did it wouldn't have mattered cuz Rapture does get in the end the BBD
3:26:33
is just churning out damage I got to say though for me way the stand out today
3:26:38
both in the Brom game as well as this even the puppy game I think he was one of the few players that was able to kind
3:26:44
of keep it together but part particularly the combination of being everywhere on the map on the Brom and
3:26:50
then uh looking like you have impacts on the Lulu I think is not an easy Fe I
3:26:56
feel like kind of NE today absolutely um we've seen so many Lulu just kind of sit there and uh be useful but not
3:27:04
obviously as we are of course listening to the coms just very basic stuff you know cousin so glad
3:27:12
cousin BD are reunited yeah yelling together
3:27:20
get him get him get
3:27:26
him great job everyone and yeah just Good Vibes as you
3:27:33
mentioned you know the the bands back together with a couple of those guys and uh feeling very good this gold graph as
3:27:40
you mentioned it was very back and forth we had some close moments early on and then eventually um in one Fell Swoop KT
3:27:47
won a team fight got the baron got Aon and then they just pushed bot and
3:27:52
end of the game it was over because they got both Buffs and we we had a we had a bit of a feeling because with the draft
3:27:59
that KT had as long as they didn't really give up any big leader early on they should be favored but you're really
3:28:05
never quite sure with that team as to whether they're actually going to clean up but they cleaned up very nicely think
3:28:11
play towards that Wing cons especially now that we know the result anded up all working out yeah well let's take a look
3:28:17
at the pom it is going to be bdd not too surprising I like your way
3:28:22
call out I I think that's totally fine but bdd you know excellent game on the Y his air was a little bit more obvious
3:28:28
for me he did also have that Victor game yeah that actually for me was exciting
3:28:35
Factor but the air game was incredible seeing him play air again I think is always uh is always a pleasure and yeah
3:28:42
bdon still hits the same way even in 2025 it really does uh and guys we do
3:28:48
have the interview ready now let's jump down to the stage thank you very much guys this is
3:28:55
year for the P interview translation of 2025 LC CS match number three joined by
3:29:00
bdd on the side of KT roler
3:29:07
congratulations you just won your first match of LC cup and became the player of the match how was playing against BX and
3:29:15
how do you feel it was overall a pretty good one um I think I will have to try even harder for
3:29:21
the next match and with the addition of C lots of fans were excited for the BD
3:29:27
CU reunion so what kind of mid jungle Synergy can we expect from
3:29:32
K I feel like even if it's been a long time since I have played with cuz our
3:29:38
Synergy has been pretty good so I think you can definitely expect a lot from us and you had a clean game three with
3:29:46
your air pick and we had expected nothing less so how would your rate a
3:29:54
lately there are lots of good options in terms of Champions so I think we started seeing
3:30:01
less of a se but I think air is always consistently good and I want to ask about
3:30:09
Victor he's a hot topic for being referred as the Trap pick and you played him in game two so what do you think
3:30:18
you know it actually does did came come off very differently as compared to how
3:30:23
it went in practice so I did struggle a little bit with vior and your next opponent is Hunter
3:30:31
life Esports please show your resolution I believe Han life orts is a
3:30:38
really good team so I'll have to put in even more effort to prepare for the next match
3:30:46
would you like to say anything to uh group Elder to D plusia in the next
3:30:56
match and that's the end of their interview from bdd and back to the space thank
3:31:07
you thank you very much dear aaya as it is group Elder with KT taking themselves
3:31:13
the victory obviously DRX Victorious as well well so 2 to one over group Baron it's a lot of pressure for the two teams
3:31:20
playing later in D+ Kia and T1 T1 obviously on team Baron needs to find
3:31:25
themselves a win Deon here alongside wiid and ox and guys KT did it they got
3:31:32
over the line we're a little worried after the lob sided loss but they bounced back pretty strongly here in game number three yeah it was more Cal
3:31:39
and collected compared to game one and game two and I think that was kind of what KT was looking for but bnk uh
3:31:48
eventually just followed the KT's game plan even though they really need to play aggressive in the all the game
3:31:53
because KT had really good late game team uh Team comp they have Jinx and azir which means you don't need to fight
3:32:00
all the game and then uh KT slows down the game and then that kind of felt
3:32:05
really bad for bnk yeah and they also had the player of the match in bdd who played incredibly here ax yeah I mean I
3:32:14
feel like him picking up the AIA is is something we know him so well for but it kind of served uh such a valuable
3:32:20
purpose in this game because you have the Jinx who obviously in a lot of these uh plays we saw the enemy team saw bnk
3:32:26
FX trying to dive and then you had the azir as like the backup the second carry who was doing a ton of damage and have
3:32:32
that peel yeah let's take a look at some of the votes here that we had for our player of the match and the comments who
3:32:38
did you guys vote for in this one let's see oh yeah both of you guys almost
3:32:43
right side of History here in yeah it was really kind kind of confused to pick up P because it's different compared to
3:32:49
PG because you have to combine all the game plays uh G throughout the whole
3:32:54
games so I feel like bdd kind of showed up stable gamepl uh he didn't really
3:33:00
shake uh maybe we don't talk about the game two but he won a game three like he was really great in general I think yeah
3:33:06
I think the top vote is good as well I was kind of going between top and mid on this one the game one man active performance really solid and the jack
3:33:13
game the ear scame misses are good but I think it was kind of just to pop off his ear from BD swung it um for me in the
3:33:19
end yeah what did you say cold gameplay from cool guy B yeah that's what did I
3:33:26
that's what did comment what what does this mean what did yeah I mean like bdd is such a cool guy you know whenever you see him you you you can't like Escape
3:33:34
smiling you know like he's always cool guy and he's really cold in game though
3:33:39
like he's just stable and not making huge mistakes so that's why I said it
3:33:44
Fox verbally tell what was yours uh well I don't have to there you go Zer and Y
3:33:50
you bread and butter you know um I feel like he these are two Champions already known for the a for a long time last
3:33:56
year's J name was huge you pick those champions from you know he's going to pop off all right let's see what the
3:34:02
Korean commentators had to say about it bdd please said Helios again just always
3:34:08
consistent and has everyone on the back and uh I got you bro that was a good one
3:34:14
there all right uh I think we we have one more yep uh a strong midlaner is like a strong backbone and that is what
3:34:21
bdd is resigning to KT uh at the end of last season and uh an important part of
3:34:27
that Squad a symphony for eyes and ears pdt's first movement Cloud Templar needs
3:34:32
to write a book hold up this writing is fire you know man that's my boy Rob TV
3:34:38
right there hold up Cloud Templar knows how to drop these lines right here again just like bdd was uh dropping the
3:34:44
