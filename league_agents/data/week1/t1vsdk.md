3:56:41
my hello and welcome back to to the 2025 lck cup we are here in day number two
3:56:48
and in series number two where we have T1 up against D plus Kia this match
3:56:54
should go the distance we're thinking actually um DK very strong they have a
3:56:59
strong rookie coming up in Shu as well very interesting roster up against T1 with their own interesting roster with
3:57:05
Doran added to the Top Lane so far we have gone nine out of nine games I would
3:57:11
hate for this series to be where that ends because let's be honest between these two teams
3:57:16
we have the drama of the world's qualifier you know way back when T1
3:57:23
actually ended up losing to DK DK's first win to a team that was ranked higher than them in like I don't know
3:57:28
how many years but it was a lot and then we all know how the story ended DK had a
3:57:33
pretty abhorent world again getting knocked out in the group stage and T1
3:57:38
won the whole thing and are now here with a new lineup as well as uh tomato
3:57:45
memes which I do really appreciate I think because of the color of the jacket uh yeah which I already saw a lot of fan
3:57:51
signs of that and for DK they have also revamped their roster in a much
3:57:58
more all encompassing way because Barrel's back and we have gotten Shi
3:58:06
called up but first this is uh unfortunately for Doran mostly because
3:58:11
of Za's left the most talked about move of the offseason the world champion roster that have been together since the
3:58:16
start of 2022 and arguably even for 2021
3:58:22
with the 10- men Shenanigans is no more Doran has come in Z has gone to Han life
3:58:27
that match between those two teams at some whenever that's going to happen it's going to go real hard yeah first we
3:58:34
have the League of Legends then we have the fist fights as well let's let's just add some extra you know woo bonus games
3:58:40
to it I I'd love to see it uh so the big here is that okay lucid and showmaker
3:58:46
they stick together aiming still with the team Barrel has rejoined with D+ and
3:58:54
shiu I'll let you talk about this guy yeah uh shiu in the short time he was in
3:58:59
Challengers and coming in after fenos who again was insane already making a
3:59:05
huge name for himself he's big and we have a lot to say but he also did an interview so let's listen to that
3:59:13
now for
4:00:04
great to hear from sh he wants to play up against Z the guy who has learned he has learned a lot from unfortunately
4:00:10
that won't happen tonight but uh should happen
4:00:16
eventually uh as they are on opposite uh opposite groups but here are the two teams going ahead to
4:00:23
tonight and shiu looking nervous Lucid now in his second year showmaker still
4:00:29
on DK will be there for theer finally joined Again by barl the man that has
4:00:34
been there when he won worldon on the other side T1 it is four out of the five
4:00:40
two time World Champions owner and Lucid sharing bit of a smile there where K
4:00:46
barel obviously also have a history and we didn't even mention the fact that bangi and pumu are
4:00:53
now is just ducking on the rest of his team are on DK they are now part of the
4:00:59
coaching staff and we'll have to see even adding an even bigger layer as T1
4:01:05
their domestic performance in 20124 started off strong and ended
4:01:10
pretty lackl tpet man what an end to the year that they have and I did this for Diablo as well I'm going to do it for
4:01:16
shio as well here are some movies that are older than shio is Batman Begins which you know I'm personally a
4:01:24
big fan didn't see that one don't know War of the Worlds Madagascar I saw War of the Worlds okay
4:01:31
Madagascar uh and Sin City all older than shu is I I maybe too many comic
4:01:38
book movies for you there that lineup Thor playing domestic a player that I
4:01:45
think all of us have sung the Praises of many a time in the last couple of years for good reason he has been at worst top
4:01:52
three for as long as I can remember uh it's been a it's been a long time and
4:02:00
she a loud Applause as well for his real debut is we can see some nerves as there
4:02:05
should be yeah I I do feel like he is one of the players unfortunately that shows it a bit more than some of the
4:02:11
others that are also just as nervous if not more nervous than he is right now it's just the way it is your first time
4:02:18
in law Park he played actually in um the season opening event uh looked pretty
4:02:24
good there but and now now's the real deal you know you sit down you're facing up against T1 kind of the the the most
4:02:32
famous Squad here at the lck it's it's a lot to handle for a very young player
4:02:38
it's it's it's probably the most famous Squad in the world uh thanks to that man
4:02:43
and the fact that they've been together for such a long time now and last year DK had basically two modes it was
4:02:49
showmaker and Lucid go crazy in the 2v2 OR aiming please carry us please aiming
4:02:56
please please don't in uh yeah please don't just carry us this time forward just cash just just cash in uh in a good
4:03:03
way which he did cuz he won the Ori uh what the gold King Bank award very
4:03:09
prestigious award and now reuni or not reunited Barrel back with
4:03:16
DK we'll have to see as I'm getting some great stats here from I I don't know if
4:03:21
it's Jon or yo but in the 2024 CL it's Kion even uh both spring and sum shio
4:03:29
made 79 solo kills 79 yeah and again I want to
4:03:35
reiterate he had such a insane performance that after uh 2023 when both
4:03:41
Lucid was called up p b left uh Bible was called right basically the entire DK roster was revamped and the expectation
4:03:48
was that they were going to be quite mediocre and then they ended up still being insane and I think a large part of
4:03:53
it was that man right there and we'll see here in his first match against T1
4:03:59
and he plays aggressive I don't I wouldn't say Dia aggressive I think that is uh that's that's a league of its own
4:04:05
but still I just don't even know how 79 is possible I remember that Rascal he
4:04:11
got like the top solo killer in lck and that was like it was like 25 or like 22
4:04:17
solo kills is obviously that celsa c is a bit cleaner and we're talking about a
4:04:23
lot cleaner but 79 that's so much anyway let's talk about the draft here a lot of
4:04:29
stuff we've been seeing so far you know scarner on red side makes a lot more sense uh but yeah Karis taken away
4:04:37
sichani getting a look what is this final ban going to be you think about stuff like C
4:04:44
Cante another strong top laner and what will it be for
4:04:53
DK right now seeing uh some fun and okay well we actually are looking it in uh
4:05:01
this is something that we saw a lot of in the last season and thinking about it
4:05:06
I think the thing about nly that makes sense in the current mattera was that most games we've seen is very snowballing but in practice hasn't
4:05:14
really felt like it's panned out and that's because playing the champion requires both your team and you to be in
4:05:21
Peak Performance you can't make any mistakes can't overstep owner seemingly
4:05:26
looking to want to match the farming potential do got to say
4:05:33
N I think Zyra one of the few junglers that does actually outpace her big advant of nly of course that she can do
4:05:38
a lot of damage from range so it doesn't have to be as scared of own or R you want to jump in eventually but don't
4:05:45
have to the ashh lock in though is a complete no-brainer here and I think something T is going to be very happy
4:05:50
with there is the flex potential but most likely is just going to go to Guma not going to be anything too crazy can
4:05:56
go for for a Brum lock in Sani is of course already banned and Zyra I think theoretically
4:06:03
flexed around but that's not what we're expecting maybe DK just dropped the same thing that like we just dropped only
4:06:10
comfort right what's next it's pretty interesting I feel like game one of a Fearless system you kind of want to go a
4:06:17
bit tier listy and try to make like a very strong composition and then as you get deeper you kind of pick the Comfort
4:06:24
but they're kind of flipping it on its head yon or Brum I would get the Brum
4:06:30
specifically cuz oh no it's going to be Leona instead so I think a Brum pick up here would go really hard for
4:06:37
T1 already you are kind of looking to kide back it is carry on br
4:06:44
which uh he does have a tendency to try and do stuff which on Braum you really shouldn't Barrel on his Leona as well we
4:06:50
are really kind of getting a bunch of highlight picks here see what the lock
4:06:56
in is going to be even though it's going to be the Y instead for you're so right though the
4:07:01
Braum goes so hard but I think it's it's yon right Y is also very
4:07:09
strong and uh you know fer is playing it a bunch in summer I'm sure Doran can
4:07:14
play it um I would have really liked to see the Braum personally it's good against all
4:07:20
three Champions on the other side it's great with Ash you've got a great landing phase but uh instead we'll see y
4:07:26
we'll see how this one goes does also take away what showmaker most likely would want to play which is
4:07:33
playing an ad0 mid with the nly so Faker going to play instead Faker Jon is
4:07:39
pretty up and down but also last time we saw Faker in ELC performance wasn't
4:07:44
great ended up obviously really leveling up over the course of Worlds and right now there is the BR
4:07:51
band should come as a no-brainer are they going to ban like Corky here is
4:07:56
what I'm looking towards with the N you don't really need another source of AP and if you want to try and avoid double
4:08:02
AP mid jungle then that would make sense going to be the Jacks instead taken away
4:08:07
so some respect being paid to shiu here immediately and Jack also good with
4:08:13
nearly anything that can provide reliable cc is going to be good it's going to be like reekon trying to think what else they
4:08:19
could go maybe T1 even picks away the Renekton here cuz we already sold the Renekton Zara and I do think that's a
4:08:25
combo that's always going to feel pretty solid that makes sense yeah puppy would
4:08:31
go quite quite hard into Leon as well yeah it's just you know a couple of
4:08:37
bands that really makes sense it's exactly what we were looking at for Cara thing about K as well as his champ pool
4:08:43
is pretty ridiculous so he doesn't have to play that kind of thing he could even play the Zyra you know you were talking
4:08:49
about that before the Zyra could be pretty good in terms of winning the lane but instead probably going to see that
4:08:54
in the jungle you see the rattic glas here hovered and it's going to be swapped to
4:09:00
re okay interesting car's re's fine but with K it does always feel like when he is on
4:09:07
Range supports just feels like he's he's really built different when it comes to engage supports still solid depending on
4:09:14
what form he's in but doesn't always hit the highight of someone like the light that is known for that specific style
4:09:20
and Bessa still open so I think she going to be perfectly happy to pick that up although it could also go to
4:09:26
showmaker and this would yeah that is just a straight up poke comp here
4:09:31
assuming the Jace is going to go mid and it's going to go damage here with Ezreal
4:09:36
NY and the Jace and I kind of like it and in that light the rail does feel a lot better right because if you just
4:09:43
have the Zyra uh you can run into some issues obviously you have the ash Arrow but with the gragas as well not only a
4:09:49
Doran classic but also adding even more dive I'm kind of loving both these comp
4:09:55
Val as we have on one side a comp lot of upfront damage lot of burst and a lot of engage for T1 and then D+ especially if
4:10:02
you can kind of get that Jay nly combo rolling the early objectives should be
4:10:07
really hard for T1 to contest uh got a last second swap I think this makes more sense yeah and I
4:10:15
this also most likely means that's not tank Chase which with this draft I I I
4:10:21
really hope so no he's just going grasp tank J he's going to go grasp but hopefully he does build damage please no
4:10:28
it's uh it's so Tom and bangi yeah doing a
4:10:34
little bow to each other yeah this a it's it's always an
4:10:39
interesting match up when you get DK against T1 um we had that pred at the beginning of the week I I think it was
4:10:45
only Atlas went for DK not just for us but uh even in I think it's totally fair I gave a
4:10:53
lot of thought to it actually I almost win for DK myself because DK is the team that always seems to get upsets over T1
4:11:00
they they always have a really fun back and forth series um fre me I I think you know sh's really got to step it up he
4:11:07
can't play nervous even if he is nervous right if he can fulfill his role and do
4:11:12
his job and actually you know get some solo kills on Doran then you're cooking otherwise I think
4:11:17
T's solidness might just be enough to get them across the line and boy do they
4:11:23
have a solid comp with the gragas in the front for Doran but guys let's do it let's jump on of the rift for game
4:11:28
number one
4:11:45
here we go game number one and already DK are getting into it here they have
4:11:51
tons of poke it is a poke comp as you mentioned before um with NY and Jace and desal oh
4:11:59
he's going phase rush you know what that means vales we are safe for this game yes well I mean no
4:12:07
it's Fearless we're safe for the day oh yeah it's true wo hey we're safe barel
4:12:13
tank Jace semi nightmar on oh god oh this is so barel so Barrel to just
4:12:21
die he's just going to die this is he might get away actually
4:12:27
but aiming is going to have to flash and he's being followed here so even if he doesn't die aiming is going to pay for
4:12:33
his sins which also happens with Barrel um so yeah going a bit too deep and now
4:12:39
you've got aiming with no flash in the bot Lane showmaker getting pretty aggressive here in the mid lane against
4:12:47
Faker but yeah that's a that's a great start for T1 guess what guys you know level one first blood is the same as any
4:12:53
other first Blood that's already a feat of strength for T1 as well on the board W op is the take away from that
4:13:00
one nicely done there by T1 read the play from thek have all
4:13:07
members ready and Ash her level one even with the bra being banned is just so
4:13:12
crazy the slow super obnoxious to BL as we saw aiming unfortunately on the receiving end of that the kill also went
4:13:18
to Gooma and now K and Guma already going to be feeling a lot
4:13:25
better and Lucid was also severely slowed down cuz clearly the idea was there to at least take a camp away not
4:13:32
going to be the case and owner is just merrily clearing through the upside is that looks like uh Doran did have to TP
4:13:40
back to Lane Shu did not and she has used the time very well Doran already
4:13:45
taken a big and again he doesn't have TP so even if they don't die just him being
4:13:51
on the back foot should allow a little bit of breathing room here for DK we'll see the fact that aiming
4:13:58
doesn't have flash available early on azreal is probably the best 8 carry to have that happen he still does have his
4:14:03
Clans that's something at least as it's very straightforward Barrel just gets
4:14:09
spotted on a ward they are clearly not expecting five people to be here and they're down a member because Shi
4:14:15
already was gone they thought that they were going in uh unspotted not going to be the case there are two sums used uh
4:14:22
cuz both Guma and ker flash there but with the baing that Luc took and he was forced to take because of the way that
4:14:29
the early early Ling face played out we'll have to see whether he can actually get anything done and whether
4:14:35
he can punish setup is there with Barrel but he does actually need to make his way over he's now done with his first
4:14:42
full clearing car already out on the map is aiming I mean he is Arcane shifting into
4:14:48
gooa who's got his Q available but it doesn't seem to matter the W lands and aiming just Autos him to death a
4:14:55
straight up solo kill goes to aiming crucially Guma hadn't backed yet because
4:15:01
of when the play happened hadn't actually spent his money and as a result
4:15:08
aiming sees the window D what feels like a full minion wave as well well Luc just
4:15:14
barely doesn't get the steal there was TR that's actually a big deal um I think
4:15:21
that Wast a good amount of time now owner is going to be on his next uh base going to be able to do a full clear already we see if he's able to use that
4:15:28
but man yeah I think he just hits a w order there at the beginning and he just
4:15:34
straight up goes in unfed by the C also has conquerer crucially ends up popping
4:15:41
there at the end and go all ready for that one and he didn't a flash crucially so couldn't use a flash
4:15:47
to dodge like a Mystic shot or anything and now the gold still in favor of T1 they still got defeat but aiming getting
4:15:55
kills on azreal is uh is one of the two pillars of good DK wins yeah it
4:16:01
definitely is I I am very curious to see if that remains you know those pillars how strong they are can they stand
4:16:07
through the years can they stand the test of time always is fun to watch
4:16:13
it's fun to watch showmaker on Jace too uh he is really giving it to Faker here in mid Faker not backing down from The
4:16:21
Challenge obviously pretty good at trading but the Jace they're actually going for a dive in 2025 in my
4:16:29
LK and gu just cleanly flashes away and survives
4:16:36
beautifully eats the the gang without too much issues loci it doesn't hit that
4:16:42
spare he trying to look for something on owner but didn't really want to risk it one more spare hitting though and they
4:16:48
might actually use that and they have mid pry they could play it Barrel Goa no flash Gooma in a lot of trouble here
4:16:53
he's trying to kite it out but there's three members of DK chasing him down and shiu will be given the kill pretty huge
4:17:01
for DK here that's a lot of faith there was a so AP nly on the team that
4:17:06
champion love to snowball but no they give the last hit to the young man in
4:17:11
the Top Lane
4:17:16
Baker it's fine time to go back now he has Flash oh
4:17:22
okay yeah well ice cold as you would expect
4:17:28
but uh he's not having a fun time in mid showmaker actually is doing a great job of winning this Lane this is what I want
4:17:35
out of my DK versus T1 B best this is like I is this the game where it
4:17:41
happens run it R can we wait what's the name again runis runis n there's no way
4:17:48
it's not happen there's not unless unless unless what if we get a 5v5 for
4:17:55
Dragon yeah and aon's going to spawn on the bottom side of the
4:18:00
map would be cool yeah let to see as we take another
4:18:06
look here so Guma with without Flash
4:18:11
especially just you can't walk up like that just yeah I don't know uh maybe he
4:18:18
feels like he can't walk up because sh was going to clip him with the ult anyway and feels like maybe there's a
4:18:25
turn potential there with his two teammates but feels like two unforced errors there back to back for the bot
4:18:33
Lane of T1 and that is with an early kill being given as well meanwhile
4:18:39
towards the top side of the map Doran has just been doing his job which is just take a beating let aiming farm farm
4:18:46
up himself and remain a threat the biggest thing for me though is specifically the
4:18:52
uh the midlane matchup the way that showmaker has been able to have very consistent pryo
4:18:58
throughout most of this early game has been really allowing DK to to pretty
4:19:03
well in terms of map pressure as barel yeah he's going to get in on top
4:19:09
of fer only level four that is going to force the flash here here out of Faker
4:19:14
showmaker just going to hold on to his so now potential to set something up in the
4:19:20
future and now you know you were saying before you know fer could flash away from a shock blast if it was heading his
4:19:27
way but now he yeah yeah make it a bit harder imagine that yeah DK wants to
4:19:33
look towards a dragon from here on out still two minutes away on the second spawn of grubs and first B did go to T1
4:19:39
but the turret pressure definitely going to feel better here I think for
4:19:45
DK yeah definitely should it does feel like all the their lanes are going quite well and Lucid has already had an impact
4:19:54
in this one setting up the play on the bottom side with this pressure letting the spear on the faker forcing him to
4:20:00
back in mid you know Barrel follows up it really feels like they are playing to
4:20:05
make sure that they win as much as possible in this early game funnily enough I feel like barl going as deep as
4:20:10
he did in the jungle was also part of that just didn't aard just really wanted to make they could get some deeps could get the early
4:20:17
game going in their favor because it is really important on the current patch it
4:20:23
it's DK also loves to play this way right even going back to 2020 when they won worlds which was a completely
4:20:30
different lineup although showmaker and Barrel Barrel now back have obviously stuck around but it's important to know
4:20:37
that this is also what they were great at in the past and then they would get a huge lead
4:20:43
and then at one objective or another things would turn to ruin and think that
4:20:50
is that is something as we as we see in this game that's that's the real question for me DK winning an early game
4:20:56
that kind of does feel like power for the course with what we've seen from this team last year especially domestically their worlds obviously was
4:21:01
uh was very lackluster but domestically I think that's where they excelled it was actually closing out games that they
4:21:08
had some issues with we'll see if the reintroduction of barrel is going to help with that or make it worse because
4:21:15
honestly could be beld yeah it's definitely not going to be just the same when you at a player like barrel uh into
4:21:22
the lineup so yeah it's a good point and it does I
4:21:27
feel mean that DK is a bit buffed on on current patch and you know future games
4:21:32
can look very different where they don't just randomly give up first Blood
4:21:38
um they already have that first objective but yeah besides you know a
4:21:43
couple of skirmishes here and there we've been waiting for a bit more action no no runis Aon in this one that's for
4:21:50
sure just three kills as it is decided at 14 minutes which one we will
4:21:58
get Barrel still level five here definitely wants to hit six and might
4:22:03
have a fight on our hands for the second spawn of grubs we are seeing though with Lucid having his uh Leandra is already
4:22:12
done and owner not having his the Poke from the Zar not quite as friending as showmaker it doesn't matter who he's
4:22:18
playing against just pummeling them as she oh here we go going to get that Al on a faker Faker there's nowhere for him
4:22:24
to go as he flashes in front of the alt oh the spear just barely going to go wide looking for the DI you got to be
4:22:32
careful Here Comes theal Al Faker gets away but not UNSC that might just be all
4:22:38
the grubs for the side of DK here as well all six of them unless owner can
4:22:43
say something about it but not looking likely at this point in time I'm glad to report that shi does
4:22:50
not seem like he's playing scared as you uh posited that question earlier vales
4:22:55
for T1 giving up these grubs not going to be the end but it does mean that the pushing power of DK going to be really
4:23:02
obnoxious to play into first turret I think we have three to four plates in bot Lane 5 to four in mid and then 5 to
4:23:09
three in favor of DK towards the top half of the map is Luci o see car there that was a little dicey
4:23:16
but there wasn't anyone around to follow up so K not going to go for anything the one itm spikes done not the
4:23:23
case is Guma might have to use sus here yeah this is a rough Flash Forward from showaker ahead of time gives him the
4:23:30
thumbs up he is sending a message on this Jace tonight he was dominating the
4:23:37
lane now he gets a kill on Guma who's one and three on this asash everything's turning up DK so
4:23:44
far owner going to use all this showing towards the top side of the map as an opportunity as in they go I mean you're
4:23:52
alting in onto Leona she was able to dodge away from that Baker in a lot of
4:23:57
trouble they'll just wait for his soul to turn back there's the stun and Shu picks up his second kill of the night
4:24:05
Luc here car is dead yeah g is dead I mean there's just no way to get away from this one you see he is being
4:24:11
caroused in between the turret and the wall and it really just comes down to who's going to get the kill and it looks
4:24:17
like it will be Lucid who does pick it up bunch of damage goes in but that will be first turret as well given over to D
4:24:24
plus Kia and that is six grups going over first tur blood being taken and now
4:24:30
DK are looking good for those Feats but the solo lanes are getting more and more
4:24:36
fed and loose pick up The Kill as big as well he's the sole AP source itemizing for Mr for T1 not something that you're
4:24:43
necessarily going to want to do anytime soon they do have decent tanks for it Doran most notably as we take a look
4:24:51
here showmaker yeah I mean that melee range that Arrow not really going to do too
4:24:58
much says no flash and you know they always call for it like right before they engage that
4:25:04
they're like I'm going to go for this that's one thing but this Faker doesn't have V
4:25:13
so going in that aggressively here onto Barrel who still has eclipse and After Shock available he just doesn't take any
4:25:19
damage and it's ambessa you're you're never alting because she has 7 million dashes so yeah the Rival of aiming seals
4:25:27
what we already know which is that that Skirmish also going to go the way of DK and now T1 on a pretty substantial
4:25:34
deficit here only one unscathed so far are Doran and owner and then one
4:25:41
objective away for DK but contesting any objective 41 is going to be considerably
4:25:47
harder from here on out because they have great engage yes but actually walking into the jungle to try and get
4:25:54
any vision is going to be tough and playing this poom from behind not something that generally you're going to
4:26:00
be very happy about yeah look see not overextending he's like hey you don't see a lot of T1 I'm just going to take a
4:26:06
good tradeing back away it's good to see this guy is uh he's typed up for a
4:26:13
reason because he he's great at getting solo kills he's very aggressive but he picks and chooses his fights very well I
4:26:19
feel so uh going to do the same there to Faker and now it looks like he is
4:26:25
grouping up to go towards the bottom side of the map we don't have the dragon spawning just yet and with Rift Herald
4:26:32
coming up soon looks like he just wants to go down there with his CP and be ready to set up for that with the seam and pick up the Feats of Strength if
4:26:39
they do get that objective should be the case here and baring that one kill that
4:26:44
they got on aiming because of barrel going in aggressively things have not been looking good for T is uh yeah that
4:26:52
cost did not do the job no no I was I was waiting for to see
4:26:58
if sh is going to follow but I don't think DK wants to do is they want to play towards that final objective that's
4:27:03
another cool down gone aing does now or is getting very
4:27:09
close R to his second item Kuma just now hitting that blade but the turrets are
4:27:15
just again it's six grubs there's a Jace and an Ezreal like these turrets are
4:27:21
going to get shredded like paper and feels like a formality before DK also picks up
4:27:28
Harold I don't even know if that was going to hit him but owner is still dead like he's not getting away from this
4:27:34
Champion the arrow is going to land and they do have a lot of the team over here but the damage is so little so sparse
4:27:40
and shu is just flashing and dashing his way to safety he is just running circles
4:27:47
around T1 right now bar doesn't even die they can't do anything to this
4:27:52
kid meanwhile lucid's just soloing the ri Herald so that's Feats of
4:27:59
Strength and Faker I think he had an inkling about
4:28:05
that but it just it doesn't it doesn't really matter right because you're just losing every lane as team one you try to
4:28:11
make the one player like okay this is it this is our chance and it just goes horrifically wrong yeah and now that
4:28:17
we've seen how the game is played out a lot of the Champions that T1 have
4:28:23
I think are great but particularly for owner and Faker who are obviously
4:28:29
insanely important for how the team functions owner on Zyra even if it is a power pick just doesn't feel like it
4:28:35
does what the team needs owner to do you need him on something well they B the vi because they're playing as but well yeah
4:28:42
something where you can play a lot more proactive as good as Zyra is the biggest
4:28:47
proactive play You're generally going to be able to make is when you outpa someone our first objective force them
4:28:52
to come into you aing hit all three of them yeah by the way no I was pretty dirty so we have
4:29:00
in the past and I'm I'm still going to mention this because it might still happen seen DK throw some games that
4:29:05
felt like that shouldn't have been thrown but from this position every game that we see with the herald coming down
4:29:11
now they should be able to get at least two charg here possibly even the second
4:29:16
turret I don't think there's a lot that T1 can do they're going to be after rely on DK making a huge
4:29:23
mistake yeah I mean you're hoping that you know maybe someone like aiming Arcane shifts in or perhaps you makes a
4:29:30
mistake because he's a rookie uh this is going to be pretty interesting he's going to just he's
4:29:37
getting question marked Pink by his own team or he did himself I'm not sure I mean he runs it towards mid maybe he
4:29:44
gets a charge there well no okay I don't I do know
4:29:51
that that was not intentional um I feel like that's a that's a safe conclusion to droll
4:29:57
so anyway su's having a great game so far and he did look nervous in his interview
4:30:03
and on stage but he's not playing nervous it's one of the big points as we both mentioned it's great to see him be
4:30:10
able to transition very well very early on in his first game it's just the first
4:30:17
game but I think we saw this particularly with kingan who particularly when he's in for and I
4:30:23
think in the LC actually was obviously him and moham were kind of the downfall at Worlds not playing up to their own
4:30:30
standard but kingan outside of that one atrox game in 2022 just wasn't
4:30:36
necessarily the guy that was going to go and put on the carry performance but that's how they won worlds in 2020
4:30:42
uh with nugi and I even if we look at the winners of
4:30:48
Worlds of the last two years which were T1 having a top laner that can go absolutely sicko mode on your opponent
4:30:56
definitely a big win that's set T1 yeah I I'm looking at an Aon uh DK
4:31:04
just running in you know they they're getting close to 10K lead I've seen them throw these F death but outside of that
4:31:10
I think this first game feels like a bit of a bust yeah I mean at this point it's really rough cuz if you're playing a
4:31:17
poke comp and you're behind you know the enemy team has levels on you they start to stack some Mountain dragons you're
4:31:23
really just not going to do much um but from ahead uh yes into a bunch of
4:31:28
squishies that aren't gragas and I guess re who has some
4:31:34
health um you're really just going to be chunking them there's really no way for T1 to ever get close to this
4:31:39
objective uh especially with barrels positioning here there is one nice control ward in this brush but you know
4:31:45
Barrel he's going to challenge that he's got his team behind him as well at least this time still the blue W Used there
4:31:52
Doran trying to get some gold into the good people of T1 is there we
4:31:58
go going to start the objective now but I got to imagine they're looking to turn and we can see them already there not
4:32:04
really going for this yeah you can see for T1 they're like well somebody's got
4:32:09
to do something we have to stop this other wise we're probably just going to lose anyway TP is coming in from Doran
4:32:16
he's got to be The Bodyguard he is level 14 and decently tanky oh they're committing this could be the moment
4:32:21
here's the barrel they got to take out a Leona of all Champs but instead the focus comes down on to aot they take it
4:32:29
and now they've got the respawns coming in and yes you he's going to go in his
4:32:34
respawn everybody on the side of T1 is just flashing away and it was actually Barrel that
4:32:40
respawned the rest of most of them were just sending it you know they got the buff and they were just they were Head
4:32:46
Over Heels going in I'm pretty sure that Shu TP before Aon was down he's like I
4:32:52
it's fine they'll get it I'll I'll area is putting his jacket on yeah no this game is done come on they got the buff
4:32:58
it's all right guys anyway uh go next it's just game one but game one is a
4:33:05
blowout VES yeah sh does he I'm like whenever the buff is up we still have a minute 50 left you're like ah just do it
4:33:12
it's fine yeah I you're not killing this guy anyway um DK they're just going to
4:33:20
send it right down mid they're not a team that's going to rotate towards spot they don't even have a bot wave so not really an option here they want to dive
4:33:27
these turrets at possible Cara looking for the engage he just dies instead Guma is going to cleanse away from this one
4:33:33
as Barrel he does not have the respawn and he's going to go in instead and look
4:33:38
to set up a kill and he's going to live until he dies 2 seconds later he didn't
4:33:45
have the ball he already died Barrel no it's okay see very nice Al very nice
4:33:51
angle there onto owner and DK they've had enough of this game they're putting on their jackets as well figuratively
4:33:58
they won out of this one they want to end T1 here in 23 minutes they don't
4:34:04
have a wave oh they do actually there was like one little minion in there and that might just do it guys Faker left
4:34:11
alone they'd love Yep they're going to take him down the damage is way too much and DK going to stomp T1 in 23 minutes
4:34:20
in game number
4:34:25
one that's the debut game Bel this
4:34:32
woo sh coming up hug here getting the Faith from his team and is Essa uh
4:34:40
basically a Bruiser Cante sure but we've seen some players get a lot more mileage
4:34:46
out of it than others and DK Coming Out Swinging here I can only hope that T1
4:34:52
fights back because again we want to maximize those games I want to go all
4:34:58
the way and the other thing that I really want to highlight here as much as I loved lucid's nly play
4:35:05
showmaker has had very un performance over the last couple of years but that
4:35:11
right there that was vintage that was 100% on and we haven't seen I feel like we haven't seen
4:35:17
that at least not throughout throughout a whole game for a good amount of time yeah I think that's fair and he he
4:35:25
came in here to send a message I feel like DK always do against T1 and see
4:35:31
most damage in the game uh like I said I'll say it again this guy you know
4:35:36
don't be fooled by his his mannerisms you know he looks a little bit nervous no this guy will just stomp you you and
4:35:43
I know a lot of people will come into this and maybe say oh I don't know Doran wasn't able to match to you I don't even think it was about that I think as a
4:35:48
team DK were just much better in this first game and T1 are going to have to go back to the drawing board we're going
4:35:55
to take a break guys and have the space we'll be right back
4:36:27
w
4:37:11
the
4:37:39
nice
4:38:10
nice
4:38:40
for
4:39:10
for
4:39:40
for foree
4:40:38
her
4:41:02
k
4:41:40
for for
4:42:31
foree
4:42:40
fore for
4:43:36
well team Baron Baron Baron need to turn it around right now through T1 because d plus Kia came to play other than the
4:43:43
first blood and the quick kill that happened aiming but after that it was all D plus Kia and the first game of the
4:43:49
series here D+ and T1 D+ up one Z Deon alongside with did and ox and that yet
4:43:57
again I feel like I'm repeating myself one more time was a very very one-sided game here yeah I mean I was excited to
4:44:04
see D Plus's first game I'm still waiting to see T's first game oh my God it just like started the
4:44:12
the invade obviously went well for them and then it started a little bit rough and then it just went downhill from there and it just felt like they they
4:44:18
really didn't show up but D+ you know there was some thoughts how would the aiming barel bot Lane uh look how would
4:44:23
SE will look at the Top Lane they looked good if this continues if this is consistent level win for a treat yeah I
4:44:29
mean so many random silly mistakes are happening uh all over the time but I
4:44:34
mean it was way too crucial we cannot say it's a small mistakes when it happens three times in a row from Guma
4:44:41
Yushi especially and know I I feel like Gooma is normally one of the more consistent members on T1 and I mean he
4:44:48
was consistently bad in this game um but normally he's he's kind of the rock sometimes when things have then when
4:44:54
there's been struggles for the teams uh and he just really was getting caught out consistent this one this is when we
4:45:00
saw a 2v2 come out uh from Faker and carrier but the ambassa see pal it so
4:45:05
well but also just doing so much damage in these fights while also being such a tank Champion I mean neither of these
4:45:12
Champions Leona andessa are easy to take down yeah I mean some of the viewers are talking about maybe T's draft is not
4:45:18
ideal but when you think about the t's draft they have Ash and Zyra and they really need to rely on their uh early
4:45:25
game uh ear laning phase right uh they need to have the pressure in the early game and then you can sble from that
4:45:32
with the Zyra but they couldn't really do that with this kind of comp because they died so much in the early game yeah
4:45:39
that is one thing that I'll say this game was going to feel quite volatile especially with d plus having this poke
4:45:44
comp with having picks like nly if T1 got ahead they have the tools to engage the setup to really push the pace but
4:45:50
once you fall behind I particularly think the Zyra really struggles into these longrange poke Champions because
4:45:56
ideally you want people to come into you you have the counter engage but if it's like an Ezreal NY and a Jace they'll
4:46:01
just fire skill shots at you for miles away and you'll get poked out and she feels so slow and immobile and Ash is
4:46:07
kind of similar as well you're never really having to come into their effective range until you're finishing them off especially if they get going on
4:46:14
the other side because if you look at all the engage tools that T1 had grouped up D+ have to fight on their terms but
4:46:21
instead they just fell behind and we just constantly getting poked off uh poked and picked off as we take a look
4:46:27
at one of our next highlights here at over at oton and yeah just more the same here yeah I mean I feel like at this
4:46:33
point the the game was very heavily in favor of of D plus it was just I'm cleaning up but they didn't really give
4:46:38
any Windows any opportunities gression com in and kind of stop T1 for to contest and then as arakan secur they
4:46:44
get the revive so it just worked out perfectly yeah and also it was really unsynchronized by T1 as well your Bol
4:46:50
Lane is on the river side and your top side is just just miles away from the
4:46:55
main main qut so it was really weird fight that T1 takes but also uh it was really hard game from the ear game so
4:47:02
yeah and one of the final things we wanted to highlight here is very much at the end of the game you had uh barrel
4:47:09
and the rest of D+ really putting T1 to the screws showing how in sync they were
4:47:14
compared to the world champs yeah this is barrial that we know from the world champion right he always flashes in even
4:47:21
though he has one HP he never goes back he always goes in and this kind of plays
4:47:27
were DK needed you know DK was having great mid lane a great ad carry but they have no tool to go in but burial is
4:47:34
filling up that really well yeah and you know it's not always the best decision but Barrel will always be ready to go in
4:47:40
and here is absolutely was the correct one and I think another big talking point people were looking to see how is
4:47:45
Doren going to look with T1 I mean you can't really put this game on him at all
4:47:50
he can you really like it he he just did his thing in the top this is like the typical Top Lane experience where you
4:47:55
look at the rest of your team and the game is cooked your 5,000 gold behind the enemy team's got a ton of kills and towers and you're like well it was nice
4:48:02
farming against you buddy one half of the biggest move of the off seon we'll see if they're able
4:48:08
to bounce back here in game number two D+ Kia and T1 casters take it
4:48:14
away thank you spacers as yes I love those games where you're just sitting
4:48:19
there you're just farming and then all of a sudden your team has fed a bunch of kills and you're like well I guess we'll
4:48:25
just queue up again and pretend that game didn't happen that was the experience for Doran I'm just hoping we
4:48:31
get kind of a real game it's very nice to see that DK it seems like all of the
4:48:36
new pickups are really working out for them you know zuu played excellently Barrel had some great moments as the
4:48:42
space was pointing out but you got to expect more from T1 you know they're still a strong team I just didn't really
4:48:49
see it at all in that game one and I want to see if they have something better prepared for game two yeah not
4:48:55
going to overreact to just an individual game but if DK actually get up end up
4:49:01
getting a second game that dominant that's uh well even then it's it's DK week one I've fallen for this trap many
4:49:08
times before and I will try not to this time around the for T1 though there are a
4:49:14
bunch of really easily fixable mistakes right felt like they were playing not really respecting the pace that DK play
4:49:21
with DK were very happy to just all in many an opportunity so hopefully T1 will be able to adjust particularly with that
4:49:29
ambessa and JS doing some heavy pummeling in Solo lens and also securing champions for your players where you
4:49:36
have a lot of confidence I think both the fake Rion and the owner Zyra is good as those picks are didn't really feel
4:49:42
like they hit the mark As we are going to continue Banning out some of lucid's
4:49:47
Champions as well as the poppy which is of course a flex between jungle and
4:49:53
support could arguably even play a top as there is the final mandatory ban coming through with the scarner and that
4:50:01
means that the Cante is in fact open here we'll see what sh is going to bring
4:50:07
against that mostly been a lot of answering is well it's not going to be
4:50:12
that that is not allowed see you come on it's Fearless uh Rumble still available
4:50:17
I was thinking also Jack saidani you know if you wanted to just bring out the Synergy right from the first couple of picks on red side but instead yeah just
4:50:25
going to go for the rumble uh obviously still a very top pick and there's that Wukong that we're loving to see nowadays
4:50:32
I I do really like this one two Pi synergize extremely well both as soon as
4:50:38
they're online at level six we going to be able to to do some insane amount of damage in the fights Rumble obviously
4:50:45
can also bully in the lane before that but we have to see what the lane assignments are going to be like Lane swaps are still definitely around now
4:50:53
what is going to be the setup here vars for Guma would make a ton of sense it's been a highly prioritized
4:51:00
pick I'd imagine it have to be LEL vars though because trying to play onit varis into Wukong does not seem like you're
4:51:06
going to be having a great time the Rada though is a really really big pick up here I think that ker looks a lot better
4:51:13
when he's playing range supports and I think that the Rada into Wukong also is going to provide a ton of value barl
4:51:21
adding even more CC on top would make sense showmaker talked about he's just
4:51:28
yeah he's going to looky Corky guys I don't don't don't get your hopes up but what about Katarina chronicler yeah okay
4:51:33
well we knew that was a prank but she was in the nox cinematic she was yeah
4:51:39
and showmaker will uh some fun with it but not actually going to lock it in the corki is also still a flex that is very
4:51:45
important though because aiming is I think one of the few it carriers that's actually played this multiple times even when corki was really just the mid laner
4:51:53
now we're going to I imagine pinch the jungle P nocturn Sani I think would make
4:51:59
sense here as far as the BS go in terms of power picks but we have to
4:52:07
see yeah Barrel talking a lot not a big surprise
4:52:12
um he's got a lot to say I I feel like he always adds a lot to the team uh
4:52:17
outside of his play he is known as one of the Masters of League of Legends Sani
4:52:22
the ban not too difficult there at least is that must be a support at least
4:52:29
yeah because the Wukong is not like the Aurora band makes sense cuz we mentioned Cori can still go to another Lane so
4:52:35
could they could go Aurora mid but at least that is a solo special that we seen come up a little bit no longer
4:52:41
limited to just leean playing that I'm going to come through
4:52:47
here and the ran instead going to be a lot less interesting as that possible
4:52:53
counter pick could have been but does make sense with the combination of that Wukong and the rumble as well able to
4:53:01
set up for those big team fight ultimates yeah absolutely and of course they want to save the final pick for you
4:53:07
know they could Flex a Corky if they really don't like what they see in the mid lane uh against Faker although corki
4:53:13
is pretty much safe against anything um Victor definitely does make sense on this
4:53:19
patch and that will be the choice here for Faker thinking about kha'zix vgo
4:53:25
would be much more down owner's Lane yeah I think the issue with vgo is
4:53:30
that looking you don't really have a vgo composition with the rest of the team like you really want something to play
4:53:35
off of LeBlanc cindra you know these very aggressive setup Champions I don't think any of those make too much sense
4:53:42
it's going to be the zenza to come through instead Zino I think kind of binds this composition together
4:53:49
showmaker having a bit of a giggle oh is it I feel like he's giggling too much
4:53:55
for it to be way into the victory Syra zarth that would make sense I
4:54:04
mean beat him with the long range there you go and now so this pick I feel like yeah
4:54:11
okay you pick it against the Victor in mid okay but with the rest of the comp though yeah okay but I agree I don't
4:54:18
actually think this works into the comp at all but how do they how do they get on top of him like how do they reach
4:54:30
showmaker Cante flank I guess that's that's about it I don't
4:54:37
think they really have great ways to get on top of this this what I assume will
4:54:42
be a big threat if showmaker can maintain a level of play it does kind of fall apart when you look at the rest of the comp because again that's very die
4:54:49
focused very aggressive going to play forward maybe he's just the turret as they're all going in you know he's just
4:54:56
standing in the back what to see there's a lot of discussion between him and barl
4:55:01
I almost feel like Barrel made the pick you know what I mean Barrel's like no no no this is absolutely goated here you
4:55:06
have to pick it like you have a choice way or zerth and he's like Zar bar like smashes the lock in button
4:55:14
the actual discussion was say he's saying you play raon mid and then I play H support come on showmaker get it
4:55:20
together man I don't want to play raan yeah raan mid
4:55:26
win uh AP rant never it's never happening looks pretty normal on the T1
4:55:31
side this side though that yeah that's a zerth in game two of a Fearless trap not
4:55:36
even game three leave it to DK to go for the crazy picks I do think the T1 come this time lot more arounded game two
4:55:43
begins right
4:56:01
now all righty here we go we'll we see First Blood happen at the level one
4:56:08
again probably unlikely although Barrel is going pretty deep into the jungle
4:56:13
they are not on the blue side of the Jungle T1 they went for their own invade got a couple of deep
4:56:19
Wards one in the lane as well they want to see what this Lane swap is going to look like if it will happen and it does
4:56:25
look like it will happen as CK are sending their bot Lane to the Top
4:56:31
Lane see how long sh waits to walk over cuz we have seen that specific w a bunch
4:56:37
of times before we see even T1 actually ping the same location there uh saw a vision ping there there is no vision but
4:56:45
they do not know that still playing accordingly and it makes sense I feel like with Champions
4:56:51
like Victor it always feels like a cold war race for who can have the most range
4:56:57
and outside of way zerif is basically the poster boy of having an infinite
4:57:03
effective range really hard to get on top of him if he positions well for the T1 composition it really is a as a oh
4:57:10
that's not great um but Lucid is also just straight up trying to look for a
4:57:17
level two play here he is quite oh nice gets the bait out there um and the
4:57:24
problem with being Zeno at level two is that you don't actually have access to your best skill in a jeel you don't have
4:57:30
q and then also Wukong has both extra armor and his smash which uh yeah
4:57:35
basically means that you're not winning that one V one and owner does have to
4:57:42
pie out I don't think it's that bad though for owner because he doesn't really waste that much time Lucid actually spends a lot of time walking
4:57:48
back and forth so have to see what the repercussions of this are in the long run but if owner crosses over and then
4:57:55
gets matched and Barrel also rotates things could get a little ugly there is
4:58:00
of course a man Advantage for T1 because they have K and Goa towards the Bots side here but even if Lucid can just
4:58:06
steal a camp like owner unvision they are aware that this is happening are they going to collapse on him they
4:58:11
don't know the Barrel's here just yet owner is not in the brush Barrel's also level one oh they
4:58:17
know and he's just going to kind of run and look at him and he's like yeah I'm
4:58:23
level one raan is he oh he's going to try okay good good scrier there yeah I think
4:58:30
Lucid might still try to steal it and owner's going to pull it out he's
4:58:36
a he's a he's a level down On's level three
4:58:42
so I don't know about this one DK yeah this you're not really getting a whole
4:58:47
lot done and showmaker also backed so yeah okay lot of waiting around just for
4:58:54
T1 to get a very nice Advantage here the reason Lucid isn't level three is
4:58:59
because of that one Raptor he missed so you look as the experience bar it's uh it's very close not actually going to
4:59:06
hit it will hit it now but I don't think you have a lot of kill threed on Doran this early on so probably just going to
4:59:11
continue his full clear ends up being a bit of a even though no actual kills have been found
4:59:18
the ultro early game but definitely favoring T1 here early on as we can
4:59:23
see because with all those Shenanigans happening
4:59:28
um DK mostly just Wast a lot of time not really getting anything
4:59:35
going yeah so definitely going to feel prettyy decent here for T1 but still no First
4:59:41
Blood you know we're we're still very much in the uh origin stage of this game
4:59:48
you know not a whole lot has happened outside of the little jungle Shenanigans Lucy going to get right back into
4:59:54
farming he's going to be down a camp that's just going to happen just based on the way that this is all played out
5:00:00
the lane swap still kind of happened as n comes in K is getting burnt here but
5:00:06
that's a big wave you got to be careful I love Jonah Strong's getting hyped as well but the zoomans pursue he's like is
5:00:13
he going to go for it I think that would have been a little bit too much as we had the very common of course uh Cante
5:00:19
versus Corky Top Lane happening throughout all of this they're actually
5:00:25
fighting right now aiming does he have Valkyrie probably not doesn't um if the Q hits I think he
5:00:34
would have been forced to flash but not going to happen and ocean Drake goes
5:00:39
over to T1 yeah aing was trying to back there so I imagine they were looking for a rotation knowing that the dragon was already
5:00:45
going to be gone but then Doran got the cancel which was what led to that whole sequence and aiming taking a good
5:00:53
beating showmaker not actually being able to
5:00:59
really keep up with Faker and that is I think one of the issues with zerif I feel like he really feels like he
5:01:06
doesn't provide that much early game obviously once you get six he gets a little better cuz you get to impact the map but very reliant on
5:01:13
getting at least a first item maybe once the inevitable sherean show comes out
5:01:20
then he can have early game laning presence but I don't think we're there yet he uh he's not that popular at the
5:01:27
moment so he doesn't get quite the same Buffs um you know maybe if show maker
5:01:33
pops off he gets played a bit more and can push it in that direction this Lane
5:01:38
stayed here framing quite nice as it is pushing into him he's deny denying a lot
5:01:43
of Cs from uh Doran in this case his Lane opponents corki versus Cante um but
5:01:51
yeah all the grubs going to go over to T1 this time objectives really looking a lot better for T1 able to get both a
5:01:57
dragon as well as the first free grubs not a single one found there and Lucid
5:02:03
still playing from behind doesn't have six yet he's not as far behind an experience as he was before so I imagine
5:02:10
him and owner will hit it at around the same time although I think owner with the blue buff being taken might Ding and
5:02:17
loose it just krug's not going to do it he going to have to at least also clear his Raptors might be a window here for T1 if they want to go
5:02:27
aggressive he's making his way up top and do see the ultimate is ready for him Lucid paing away I don't really think
5:02:35
you can dive them though yeah like it's Rumble diving in 202 five as well well
5:02:41
that and and it's it's Rumble if he can just ult the wave and it seems like darl like yeah no
5:02:48
I maybe just covering for a possible gank could also be the angle here it's
5:02:53
not a whole lot happening you know there's not a lot of uh camps right now is okay we're going to have a bit of
5:02:58
damage coming in on Su that's uh more than half his health taken down Lucid is here owner spotted and Sh just holding
5:03:06
on to his Al just in case might use it here but we do have showmaker waking his way up show making his way up nice I
5:03:14
should say um just ready to Al if need be look at the vision control here from T1 and in last game felt like K and
5:03:22
owner were never really on the same page didn't see them link up very different this time around like they've been a lot
5:03:30
more in sync is it's such a barrel thing he just walks in a direct straight line straight into two people in the bush
5:03:36
just happens so often yeah why wouldn't he he doesn't have to be right there's no feros no way he dies everything has
5:03:43
been calculated ahead of time yes he knows he is a
5:03:49
realizer he he's always aware he just sometimes chooses to ignore his better
5:03:55
judgment is is what Atlas would say yeah well he does it percentage based you know he's like the probability chance of
5:04:01
this happening is so low that it it's not going to happen but then it happened that time so he looks really silly and
5:04:06
that happens like once every second game yeah so I guess he's not very good at math then well he's like you know it's a
5:04:12
6040 so it favors me so I'm I'm going to try to take the angle but unfortunately it was the 40% this time all right
5:04:19
unlucky is Barrel that's all he is I did win two World Championships I
5:04:25
don't I don't know unlucky well yeah just during the regular season oh yeah yeah it's different Lucid now has hit
5:04:33
level seven going to get a crabby here as well I'm going be too bad about that one and
5:04:38
I do think we're going to have a actual brawl breakout in about 50 seconds for
5:04:44
either these grubs or the dragon because DK are being put in a very uncomfortable position by T1 because they can't they
5:04:51
can trade and then hope you get first blood but you really don't want to give over the Feats just like that I mean
5:04:57
level six for KH all right he hit the 40% there nice
5:05:03
yeah uh is that every play that now fails a 40er it just wasn't yeah it
5:05:08
wasn't meant to be uh because T1 look at the draw you know can just go for Ida
5:05:13
right they can just and with the top side Vision they have I think you just give up the dragon just play towards the grubs I don't think there's a way for DK
5:05:19
to reliably contest because but DK did play insanely aggro loost like they even
5:05:25
know where Lucid is they have a warden his red bu they are so aware of everything
5:05:31
that's happening even b side look at all these Wards DK doesn't get to play the game and it looks like the Feats or at
5:05:39
least this one one fet as it's just going to get given over they're not going to bother yeah you know
5:05:46
it's it's nice to deny the grubs as well I I don't think they really had a chance to deny it here the flash engage ranata
5:05:54
um shocker does not work out um but I was going to say maybe he got the
5:06:00
flash out of someone but he didn't even kind of it's for Contin cor yeah so yeah
5:06:06
was nice try carer good good effort good effort that was a rumble maybe this shed some light on why the Braum wasn't
5:06:12
picked uh they had had enough of engage Braum yeah so now T1 first feet already
5:06:19
in the pocket going to try their best to secure something else and hoping that as
5:06:25
I say that Barrel doesn't just give up for his blood but we've watched this player for a while so you got to be bit
5:06:30
uh bit careful and this time around no no weird deaths by T1 no disrespect to
5:06:37
the opponent that alone is not going to be enough cuz we get to talk a little bit about the team fights now that the early games played out so
5:06:44
evenly sh going for a trade here Doran
5:06:49
lining that Q3 and she says well you want to you want to drop the gloves let's
5:06:55
go but yeah it's just Top Lane so not much going to matter I'm very curious to
5:07:02
see what's going to happen with the zerth as the game comes along because it is Victor versus zerth they're just
5:07:09
farming now for 12 minutes yeah it's it's the the Zer is
5:07:16
the one thing where I'm I'm not I want to see I want to see the vision but
5:07:21
besides the fact that obviously like you outrange him you provide a lot of uh backup fire as the rest of your team
5:07:27
goes in I guess that makes sense it also means that if you go in and you hit even a
5:07:34
little bit of your damage then showmaker is always going to be able to make sure that there's no people getting out
5:07:39
unscathed and into both the Victor but especially into Rada I think that things
5:07:48
like the Zera are always going to feel amazing because it means that you have a way of playing the game that doesn't
5:07:54
revolve around you diving into the n and they still going to be somewhat forc to again with the rest of the Champions
5:07:59
that they have but I think that particular like both Wukong and raan are quite good at going in baiting out and
5:08:06
then weaving in and out of the fight again uh that's a lot of damage yeah Lucid though is here they're turning
5:08:12
this one around it was a fatal along First Blood given over to lucid and they
5:08:17
want a bit more Barrel get pretty low owner he says this is my kill but Barrel's going to get away meanwhile we
5:08:24
got the bail out here losd looks like he will get the kill and deny the bail can he actually survive too that would be
5:08:31
insane they all survive after that
5:08:36
unbelievable never will 60% that BL all the time vales as not only do they get
5:08:43
the first blood but they get two kills on the Wukong yeah that's Trinity for stun he
5:08:54
is yeah this is getting pretty crazy uh for this huk Kong and as you mentioned
5:09:00
the first blood as well you know you got Mountain Soul on the cards here you get a Fed
5:09:05
jungler you get a chance now they did a lot of damage to that top turret oh did
5:09:11
you if that Harpoon hits yeah the the blue train kit nicely
5:09:16
done there by Faker not trusting and look at the again the amount of vision that's available for T1 hope we get a
5:09:23
replay of that because that that is act this is it's such a good thing they are just
5:09:31
not it's the one pocket where they don't have any Vision at all and the moment gets on top of Victor it's just done
5:09:38
like he didn't even to use his flash right and then here able to get the
5:09:43
flash then the uh the rata W was already
5:09:49
ticking for bailout so he doesn't have to do anything just needs to get
5:09:54
out and DK fans the DK fans are always
5:10:00
always the most passionate um there's been a lot of ups and downs yeah yeah
5:10:06
hey BR was down so yeah yeah yeah uh they're for an upswing if they
5:10:13
get first herb here though uh the first B doesn't really matter it looks like that is going to be the case I mean
5:10:20
they're going to dive dor in here but he is Cante does it matter the damage yes
5:10:25
it is stacking but first turret blood goes to T1 so they get the feat of strength on their
5:10:31
side depends on what happens to Dragon here because I think T1 takes that the boots are strong but if DK then also
5:10:38
answer with give a turet of themselves and get dragon because Doran is there Doran is going to be fine right he's
5:10:43
going to come back up in about 10 seconds has his teleport available so I
5:10:48
I'd say that's still a T1 favorite trade just because of the fact that it opens up
5:10:54
boots and unlike last game I also don't feel like they had
5:11:01
to uh kind of weather the storm against the Poke well kind of play that half
5:11:07
poke half we a lot of spars but the Sol Lane is getting fed it was not just that
5:11:12
this time around they have a lot of Team fighting Power I don't know though DK
5:11:18
they're coming in trying to snipe out Guma here it's not really doing much that equalizer was pretty bad fromc it's
5:11:26
just missing everyone did not did not Inspire much joy and oh change coming in
5:11:32
but will be cleansed off ni little m's bit of damage coming in as he's pulled
5:11:39
towards the guys he's burning got to be careful with that one as now owner in a lot of trouble has to go back in looking
5:11:46
for the reset and he will be taken out but she will go down himself so one for
5:11:52
one but here T1 I mean you get the mountain Drake a bit of of range with the Zer
5:11:59
here they're trying to Siege onto this mid turret and get a bit more as actually maybe even an engage here but
5:12:05
instead it's jante and the engage doesn't happen says
5:12:10
better luck next time yeah that mckill actually I think ends up coming pretty clutch there from Barrel got that first
5:12:17
then that he could cleanse Shu and then K could have definitely used his
5:12:23
Rado earlier I think that could have actually saved owner because they just needed a bit more time to actually get the reset and it is with
5:12:31
zenzo if you can get into a longer fight with your heal on your uh your passive as well as thundered Sky you can really
5:12:38
survive a lot so instead is going to be I think a DK favorite tra if to take another look uh the olds pretty bad here
5:12:45
from DK neither of them really does anything oh he actually hit ker with one tick yeah it's exactly uh and then T1
5:12:55
you got the dragon like they use a bunch of their cool downs and I think they should take it and leave it at that but
5:13:01
that's not the case oh Faker in a bit of trouble he does have ker nearby though as the Wukong doing a decent amount of
5:13:07
damage with the fness he got early on but Faker is going to live and now the rest of T1 comes over the top Barrel
5:13:13
will be taken out in essentially a 4v1 the rest of DK just backed away from
5:13:19
that play so that the reinforcements were there and they wanted none of it and this time T1 That's a classic as
5:13:26
well Faker in a position where it looks like it might be too good to be true
5:13:31
ends up being just that sh definitely still respecting Doran even with dandre
5:13:38
Doran went Spirit vage first so between just that as well as the sustain he gets
5:13:43
particularly when he h got to be uh got to be respectful and Barrel going down 40%
5:13:50
happens to the best of us UNL take another look at started off
5:13:56
with showmaker getting taken wi low help me trade with
5:14:04
this said Baker get
5:14:11
ging there immediate backup from his team showmaker not able to quite get the
5:14:17
damage and by the time Lucid was on top of him he was the only one doing damage there wasn't really any further follow
5:14:22
up couple of orders from aiming for example could have changed it but I think DK made the rle to just let Barrel
5:14:28
go do note we haven't mentioned this really as much T1 might be down a little
5:14:33
bit in Gold but not only do they have the Feats but they are sitting on Mountain Soul point where which
5:14:40
invalidates I think basically everything that DK wants to do I think DK's comp is very reliant on getting that big up
5:14:45
front burst of damage and then play from there and you can argue like play a little bit around the zerif Poke neither
5:14:51
of those things will work uh once Mountain comes through so T1 as long as they play it slow set up for that
5:14:58
objective I think they're looking really good to bring us to a game number three th might be in some trouble here but
5:15:03
even if he ends up going down I don't think it means too much oh sh trying to beat him into this fight d and oh this
5:15:10
time it's a nice equalizer he is burning the whole way through but it's Cante Here Comes
5:15:15
lucid and he kind of messes up the angle Doris just going to maybe run this one
5:15:21
off aiming no not again he's going to flash forward and he's going to bait
5:15:26
Lucid into it Lucid is so dead as eventually he does be taken out as T1
5:15:33
they get a big win in that pick and now they'll look for OT and that's Ador
5:15:39
special right there I thought he was dead clearly DK thought he was dead as
5:15:45
well and the overchase ends up costing them the early as now T1 not only did
5:15:53
they get those K BR sh doesn't have out theodon feels like it might be a done
5:15:59
deal Doran still alive we'll see if showmaker and his buddies can turn the tide but with the Zone control I don't
5:16:06
think that's happening hey I he's going to just have to try to get in there and go for the
5:16:11
seal they are looking to take out Kuma but he's just not that weak and now he's got the buff the rest of T1 thinking
5:16:18
about going in they're just going to back away from this one actually a TP from Baker will be denied so kind of odd
5:16:26
positioning there but he's going to back away and T1 get away with the buff and
5:16:31
we'll look for another push really big win for T1 and yeah DK I was about to say you
5:16:36
got to high tailor to towards that Dragon you cannot give away the mountain Soul Shu doesn't have his TP available
5:16:45
but neither does anyone on T1 have TP the problem now is that even if you win the fight that in of itself not going to
5:16:50
be enough as we take another look at how Doran got to survive cuz it felt like a done deal first gets the reposition and
5:16:57
gets over the wall and then this is kind of insane and just a couple of hit Rockets would have been the end of it
5:17:03
Lucid just as you point out misses up the W he also could have Ed
5:17:09
and then insult to injury gum's old hit aiming uh doesn't immediately get out of
5:17:15
it then the flash W connect and now they might lose soul for that and that would
5:17:21
bring us to I think almost guaranteed game number three vales yeah I'll have to wait and see how
5:17:27
this one does play out it's still at least an even gold state so maybe there's a fight that DK can take Lucid
5:17:33
though spotted on the flank and get the dragon the problem is that you don't actually kill anyone but
5:17:40
there's no TPS I think T1 should just send it I mean you you've got the buff
5:17:46
right you've got the res locid spotted he's aled away he's not able to get in range they don't even commit to this one
5:17:52
DK as y just going to Mel's to slow off and DK back out of that so Mountain Soul
5:17:58
over to T1 no Baron and I mean at least for DK
5:18:03
maybe you can kind of just wait out the timing as faker's just kind of wandering into the jungle is like I will use this
5:18:10
I'm using it guys pleas please take me down I love how DK is just like no uh-uh
5:18:17
not doing it which please get well they still get stuff for taking him down as
5:18:22
long as they don't trade kills I think you still should yeah 100 gold yeah yeah
5:18:29
that's still 100 gold if you don't sure yeah no exactly
5:18:35
yeah instead they'll just wait until it's gone which it should be relatively soon uh
5:18:43
same for the end of the game right that's what you're I don't even believe that this game is is over no because yes
5:18:50
T1 got outon but a lot of times we'll see teams just like win early to mid and then get Aon and just kind of win the
5:18:57
game off of that yeah yeah but I don't care about the Aon I care about the mountain Soul yeah they have Mountain
5:19:02
soul and the zerth is like he's there with a rumble on his team well I did go
5:19:09
blood Letter so that should help yeah but like what's next it's still double
5:19:15
AP into cantti as Spirit vage yeah maybe you a lot of times you can see the
5:19:21
thought process in DK's team fighting it's like we're going to blow up a squishy generally Guma uh sometimes
5:19:28
Faker but well Faker also went for like the abild he's gone for he's beefy cuz
5:19:34
he has he hasn't upgraded them yet but he has the Merk TRS which will have a shield then he Arch angels and Cosmic
5:19:40
drive so he's not and he also has gone resolve tree I forgot the exact runes that he's gotten but got to imagine that
5:19:47
he is going to be off to take down bone plating not a lot in Ling phase that
5:19:53
makes sense so that's one I don't know about the other going to be tough suffice it to
5:19:59
say showmaker going for shadow flame I imagine just void stuff next everyone on DK should prioritize trying to get as
5:20:06
much shred as possible because those resistance are going to be beefed up and
5:20:12
as you're saying game isn't over over but I'm feeling good about a game number
5:20:17
three if you know I wouldn't mind it at all yeah no even this this was a this is more of a thinking game the previous one
5:20:26
was Mayhem this one well I I say thinking mans but then we had that secret of play from DK just now so maybe
5:20:32
not May thinking maname okay who is the thinking man T1
5:20:38
in this case oh that makes sense yeah yeah okay DK not doing a lot of thinking a lot of instinctual
5:20:45
reaction reacting that's the word uh Barrel spots them and then just runs
5:20:54
away you don't need the Z you can just play corki with foron uh T1 going for T1
5:21:01
Baron just going to start it up on vision and say okay come at us and what
5:21:06
are you going to do about it K is getting chunked by this cor key but now with the TP coming in they want to turn
5:21:12
around and run away aiming in a rough spot Lucid goes for the AL but they take T1 off the baron per is still pretty low
5:21:21
but Lucid did use this ultimate ability so did Barrel so still five alss here
5:21:27
for T1 and to be honest I mean they might just start it up again they have total control of this area of the map so
5:21:34
really the onus is on DK to try to check it but they can also keep Trading health bars quote unquote because they
5:21:40
have the shield so you can see as long as you use that going to be really hard to win another TP this time it's
5:21:47
Faker I mean the flanking Victor not as crazy but owner's getting in there he's
5:21:52
really making this happen as now the flanking Victor trying to burst down showmaker and that he will with the help
5:21:59
of gooa they get a couple of kills and Goomba will survive as well and so I guess that flanking Victor was pretty
5:22:05
good after all and lucid
5:22:10
can he even kill Doran he has old oh no Sor old just timed out yeah I I guess he he's got corki
5:22:18
okay that's a nice little pick doran's going to get picked for free yeah if is Cleaver good enough corki is his passive
5:22:24
able to get through him uh that was definitely one of the most proactive
5:22:31
Victor plays I've ever seen do appreciate that tping in flashing over
5:22:37
getting the uh the mega stor and they'll get Baron but who cares they further solidify the gold lead take a
5:22:43
bunch of crucial cool Downs no flash for showmaker sh or for
5:22:49
aiming as a take another look at the replay here and it's owner that actually
5:22:55
this time around able to get the setup that he needs right carry up for already flash then even after showmaker flashes
5:23:02
own still connect Theo gets the knock up and then Doran tanks while Faker blitzes
5:23:07
through it's kind of insane Goa had like two people on him and he was getting peel yes and he had the bail out but he was
5:23:14
still able to kind of have the wherewithal to get the snipe on the
5:23:19
showmaker to finish him off yeah like it was very clear that the comms were clear in fact and everybody was like okay kill
5:23:26
showmaker he's out of position he has no flash so nicely done by Goan Faker there
5:23:31
T1 clearly tighten it up after game number one the only way they lose is if they oh my
5:23:37
God nice equalizer but that's a shinal so not really amounting to Too Much see
5:23:43
now in a really rough spot just totally caught up Barrel as well just joints him he says I won't let you go down a load
5:23:50
Lucid just spinning in the backline as meanwhile Doran is just diving he is gante he's like okay turret changes
5:23:57
whatever and he's going to go down to it actually owner as well in a bit of trouble here ult coming down and
5:24:03
actually he's totally fine the rest of the team T1 does come in and clean his up there's the
5:24:10
ace and T1 feeling pretty good about their situation here looking for Elder as I
5:24:17
was about to say the only way you lose this game if your T1 is lose Elder and they they don't lose it they don't flip
5:24:22
it the amount of burst that comes through there on Barrel absolutely disgusting ends up being enough and then
5:24:29
carry out finds both a great ult to Zone away the damage dealers while also
5:24:34
getting the handshake to put sh in a position but asure saying Barrel so graciously decides well might as well
5:24:42
look for the turnaround the turnaround does not happen uh toaster ofen not hot
5:24:47
enough she unfortunately in this game not nearly as big as it was in the last one and then Doran goes down but who
5:24:53
cares it doesn't matter Elder is going to be picked up I guess they waited as long as possible for the respawn or I
5:25:00
I'm not sure if it was the respawn or if they just want have the buff for as long as possible to guarantee Baron and uh Elder up time but
5:25:10
I don't think we're uh we're going to be seeing anything else as Lucid this is a challenger special he still got it where
5:25:17
you going buddy a year into the lck yeah he tried to go for the HM steel but he's dead well I might not be dead but uh now
5:25:25
he's dead right yeah probably okay least W
5:25:31
but like Dodge well he's getting collapse on he's he's dead no they oh
5:25:36
yeah he's didn't it didn't tell us it's fine doesn't
5:25:43
matter well that should be Exodia here in just a moments for T1 they'll have
5:25:48
Elder and baron as Doran we now have have two separate timelines Bel this because uh
5:25:57
where this is either about to be the funniest story for DK fans about how I did the classic DK thing of stomping
5:26:02
game one doing a weird pick game two and then losing the series yeah or they finally turn that around and for T1 if
5:26:10
they do end up winning it's the classic uh lose game one win the next two yeah or like win game one and then P around
5:26:16
in game two and then win game three yeah like they do both teams do this all the time yeah I I feel like we come into
5:26:23
every new year and we're like new team new players new us no it's exactly the
5:26:28
same oh nothing ever changes there a TP comes in and all
5:26:34
that's left standing is the Nexus and I don't think it's going to be for very long V this yeah at this point Exodia
5:26:43
acquired you've got so much poke with varis and Victor and Curry's just going
5:26:48
to send an Al in knowing that uh they're going to have to stop them on these turrets but they're not going to stop
5:26:54
anything except themselves as Doran uh will go down so they got him
5:26:59
and that's about it that's a gigantic storm and uh e is actually going to be
5:27:06
sniped there as down with go the Nexus it is a Quadra for Guma and there you go
5:27:13
T1 will take down game two six game again vales we are going 12
5:27:20
for 12 not going home early on any of these days as I imagine both the other teams
5:27:28
in group Elder and group Aron are looking at this with fear and ttention
5:27:33
in their hearts because both game number one and game number two I think felt
5:27:39
particularly game number one was up e the blow but even game number two I felt like once DK got kind of stifled in
5:27:44
their early Shenanigans and we saw the the the Zera not really do a whole lot there was the
5:27:50
one moment where they got the kill on owner and fake but outside of that didn't really feel like DK was able to
5:27:56
make much of a mark in this one it's uh it's all going according to
5:28:04
what we may have expected looking at the matchup coming into this one let's take a look at the postgame Faker with the
5:28:09
most damage the zerth quote unquote counter pick save
5:28:15
for R5 for showmaker did not do a whole lot except Flash and die uh maybe next
5:28:23
time we have fold around with the zerth yeah Lucid also not able to have the
5:28:28
impact kind of snowballed from that early one Raptor and then wasted a lot of time never really was able to get
5:28:35
anything besides the one oh that wasn't enough turn to get and and Hey Doran baited them in again yeah very
5:28:42
nice well guys we are going to take a break and have the space we'll be right back for game three
5:29:08
he
5:30:06
you for
5:31:07
y Ru St crowns meet your
5:31:13
downfall R st crowns W meet your down
5:31:48
again
5:31:53
again mother's
5:32:03
again they think that they run this town they bur their bones with crowns they
5:32:12
they can hide in SM but I'm coming in with fire I never losing
5:32:20
fire I never the
5:32:27
r scream their CRI
5:32:35
saing the fin
5:33:03
itou looking AF looking so
5:33:10
afraid every day you know I have the heart to
5:33:19
break never going to dra
5:33:26
the F again you
5:33:33
with I never lose fire I never St the
5:33:39
r or ever feel the fear inside I hear the screaming
5:34:27
I
5:35:05
k a 12 out of a possible 12 here in day
5:35:12
number two of the lck as the world Champs tie it back on up here against D+
5:35:19
one:1 T1 battling back degon here in the space alongside wiid and ox and
5:35:25
gentlemen it was looking dire at the beginning with some big plays from Barrel but they battle back D T1 and
5:35:33
they convincingly closed this one out yeah I think a big story if it was kind of the objective control that T1 really
5:35:39
maintains so even though they ended up losing out in the first blood still had uh the Feats of Strength unlock and also
5:35:45
getting the mountain so really just solidify their lock in the game and also Doran saves the day for the T1 once
5:35:51
again and I mean for the first game maybe it was really harsh on him like you really cannot blame him on him and
5:35:58
this kind of game like he proves him and I think it was kind of a hero moment for
5:36:04
the T1 honestly I think it took a lot of the pressure off of him with game number one it's like look my my teammates are
5:36:09
the one that are making the plays here where everyone already got the ins out of the way so you know fresh slate let's
5:36:15
take a look at some of the highlights here as in the mid lane early on in this game it's a big big play by the D+
5:36:22
jungler and from Barrel as well I think this is the DK uh kind of fight that
5:36:28
they were looking for Wukong and rakan just jumps in and zeras is shooting all over again and I think that was again
5:36:35
synchronized really well synchronized play by a jungle and support especially baril once again living with one HP and
5:36:43
save the day again I mean Luci it just the decision making the flash over to W straight after uh just played about as
5:36:50
well as you could expect to uh and really find the EDG in that skish yeah that type of play can be deflating
5:36:55
especially how close those health bars were to being it's a tilter it is absolutely a tilter but you know what
5:37:01
else is a tilter when you chase after someone that you feel you had dead to rights and then you end up dying your
5:37:08
and at at the very onset of this play we're like oh here comes the door in play and I feel like he plays this perfectly like gets the flash over the
5:37:14
wall the long flash Dodges away from the big one here and then Jukes Lucid just a
5:37:20
little bit here thinking he's going to go the other way and it also gets a damage reduction here to block the burst
5:37:26
from aiming anything played differently and he would have gone down and although aiming gets out again this is actually
5:37:31
the game-winning Play Because Lucid dies and they go straight to attan after this for sure man and also your Eddie Cary
5:37:38
lost all the Summoner spells and that kind of accelerate the game for T1 I mean before that I think DK played
5:37:44
really well around the pressure and the the map rotation but after that T1 kind of snowballed the game really well oh
5:37:50
yeah the T1 fans here in law Park have been waiting for the DOR and play when they showed him on the screen at the
5:37:56
very beginning after the walkouts all the fans were cheering and after that play it really turned around the
5:38:02
momentum for T1 as we take a look at this draft you guys had some issues with how this one played out here for plus
5:38:07
yeah I mentioned that I like ukong and rakan and zerat it does make sense with Rumble as well because you just jump in
5:38:14
uh you doesn't you don't care about your teammate's position you just jump in and they can just shoot their ability from
5:38:19
miles away but uh I think corki is kind of uh out from their team comp because
5:38:25
you want a strong Lane but you have rakan as your support which is weakest laning phase and also in the team fight
5:38:32
your role is kind of off uh from the other Champions yeah it felt like one thing to me is that the composition of
5:38:38
D+ is is quite bursty but lacks a bit of DPS that immediate impact but you're playing this like a zzza who can block a
5:38:44
lot of damage as can Cante the Rada can really just cause an issue when you trying to connect on that so if they're
5:38:50
not immediately taking out targets like the Victor and the varis they're going to have difficulty and then it was a mountaina and T1 had all the Drake
5:38:56
stacked up and I think they just as soon as they lost that kill pressure the comp just looked so lifeless well did I I I
5:39:04
want to ask you here with D+ and the way that they've played and the success that they had who do you draft around here as
5:39:11
we can see some of the Fearless Champs that have been taken away so far uh I feel like uh they're still really good
5:39:17
with the jungle support playing together so uh I want more uh Rock and steady
5:39:24
support rather than rakan because rakan is kind of feeling weak right now you're just so weak in the lane and also after
5:39:31
the landing phase uh rakan got a lot of change changes uh you cannot really
5:39:36
insta engage on enemy Champions so I feel like barel need more some kind of flashy
5:39:42
Champions like Leona but Leona is gun so maybe Nautilus can help them to proceed
5:39:48
the game phase I think like having a strong engaged Duo like the Wukong raan makes sense but I think I would love to
5:39:54
see them pair aiming with a pick that that just uh sort of helps out with that
5:39:59
cuz we've seen him really pop off and things like the zeri like the Kaiser these big carry Champions where you're
5:40:04
cleaning up the fight and I think corki just it doesn't really fit how I think of aiming as a player and I think if you
5:40:10
play around him we saw it all last year what a team can do when they play around aiming T1 and D+ doing battle here and I
5:40:17
think it's a good time to remind everyone back at home if you want to show your fandom right now you have the
5:40:22
opportunity to subscribe to the lck channel and fly those flags they're
5:40:28
animated get the T1 red up get the black of D plus Kia who will take it let's
5:40:33
find out as we send it back on over to our casters and I ask you real quick crony uh how do you feel young rookie
5:40:40
Shu has been doing so far while he was awate in game one game
5:40:47
two not not not necessarily quite as great but hey that's okay as long as he
5:40:54
pulls it back for game number three I would like to see him have a great performance on the champion that isn't Cante and ambessa cuz I feel like those
5:41:01
will always just kind of take away from your shine if you do well on them because of what they do and they stand
5:41:08
for and how many fans feel about them as game number three and
5:41:13
casters yeah just just just a lot of and showmaker personally I I haven't seen
5:41:19
his a bestn yet but the Cante one is is a classic yeah it's hard to outo the
5:41:24
gante one how deep do the champion pools go well we do know you know on the side
5:41:30
of T1 you think about fak rink area for me specifically those are the two players that I think can really dig deep
5:41:36
and pull out some cool picks and still be quite good at them on the side of D+
5:41:41
I think showmaker absolutely could do it I'm a little bit worried for lcid you know how deep does it go he looked
5:41:47
fantastic on the Wukong but now that's gone shiu you know he one of the newer
5:41:53
guys up here he's played a decent amount of fearless though in Challenger league so he's got that behind him that's the
5:42:00
one thing sh as you're pointing out Challengers already had Fearless throughout the entirety of last year
5:42:07
probably going to stick with the maai and vians at least anything else remains
5:42:13
to be seen scarner also has to basically still be taken out of Sani yeah Sani I
5:42:20
think we saw did see Sani make it through to what second rotation uh last time around I wouldn't be too surprised
5:42:27
if that's the case ad G is already getting pinched here and aiming does play a certain yo uh which we did see T1
5:42:35
pick up Z at some point throughout summer but I do remember that it took them like weeks to kind of be okay with
5:42:41
it and it still didn't really feel like the type of style that they'd like to play showmaker as you point out with his
5:42:47
champion pool should also always be able to play an 0 mid this is the man that
5:42:52
played what like mid Renekton uh a pretty considerable amount back 2021 as Aurora also going to taken
5:42:59
away scarner still up Vai also still up so maybe they'll trade I don't think you
5:43:06
should give over to scarner but then they do get the vi forona who also is exceptional at the champion cuz now it's
5:43:13
only going to be one of the two that can be taken away here and I would have to say that scarner needs to be removed cuz
5:43:19
that champion is just kind of insane right now yeah feels like DK has set
5:43:25
themselves up pretty well because you have to ban the scarner you don't really
5:43:31
want to take V and give them scarner right so you kind of left between a rock
5:43:36
and a hard place you have to give them bu and that is exactly what happens here so bu first pick for Lucid that you're
5:43:43
already in a great spot regardless of what the the rest of the draft looks like and let's see what T1 have prepared
5:43:51
in response uh the nocturn available this
5:43:56
time we saw it B second rotation and also in the first
5:44:01
series of today in game three just to try to deny like a Orie knockturn comp
5:44:07
which we did see yesterday could be a consideration but with poppy locked
5:44:13
in looks like maybe not o that's That's a classic poppy could obviously still be flexed to
5:44:20
free rolls but most likely with the air as well we've seen that combo withon you're able to slam people into the
5:44:26
poppy wall poppy is also a very threatening early game Champion so you
5:44:32
got to respect I do think that Poppy jungle did take a bit of a hit because of how much harder it is to die one of
5:44:37
the biggest strengths that the champion has is that you can walk up to any Lane particularly early on or used to be able
5:44:44
to at least and just make sure that you stun lock them into the turret fire up
5:44:49
the burst that is a classic it's something that we I don't think we've seen Ari yet I mean we haven't we're on
5:44:57
day two but we are already 11 gam deep yeah so it is uh something that makes a
5:45:04
lot of sense I was kind of expecting to go for five LeBlanc though cuz showmaker still gets LeBlanc bands like it's
5:45:10
nothing that is a pick that I am very wary to trust aiming on because aiming
5:45:18
as ORS already highlighted as well can pull out some absolutely insane carry performances but on Champions with
5:45:25
no escapes has been known to get caught every now and then she's got the
5:45:31
Chompers not yeah um yeah even aiming didn't look very confident in aiming to
5:45:39
play through JS after that lock in um they're going to ban just a bunch more ad carries but like what you ban what
5:45:46
like Caitlyn Draven yeah and also if you're picking just Jinx like uh part of the reason why
5:45:55
you want to play Jinx is with something some kind of enchanter that can really play well alongside of it but now to you
5:46:00
wouldn't get an opportunity to potentially take away the Lulu I hope they do yeah I I think a Lulu band would
5:46:06
feel cuz already you know the one that's going to engage on thek is going to be Lucid with
5:46:11
thei so being able to deny him the cuz the Lulu is so nuts here it's really
5:46:17
good to counteract big plays from either the azir or the Jacks it allows you to
5:46:22
even use it aggressively on Lucid when he goes in with his ultimate or most obviously he can just use it to keep
5:46:28
aiming safe as the Zia going to get takeen away instead so maybe Zia Caitlyn Zia and
5:46:36
then Guma might lock Draven but he can swap so you don't necessarily have to be in that lane not 100% sure but we will see
5:46:44
I mean Goa is a great Z I just don't think especially with ran not being able to be played that it deserves a ban here
5:46:52
no also Z has just been n like playing Z into J get it into VI but into Jinx I
5:46:58
don't think you going to be too set as there is the Lulu B do want to know that one of the best answers into the Jacks which is gragas has already been played
5:47:05
so he no longer available during pilot that himself in game number one so sha
5:47:10
won't be able to go towards that as a possible counter here so what he's going to pick there's not actually that much
5:47:16
left yeah not a lot of meta stuff nar's Gone gragas Gone Cante gone Rumble gone
5:47:23
and besta Sani there's the S ban
5:47:29
finally yeah they're they're not 100% sure where this poppy is going to go and you want to deny the Sani Jax insanely
5:47:35
strong to 2v2 towards the top side of the map yeah Jin I can't believe we haven't
5:47:41
talked about it yet but both Jin or zigs would make sense I like the Gin more when you already have the azir looks
5:47:48
like that is going to be the lock in here it's a T1 classic we've seen them pull this out many a
5:47:54
Time see if it's going to work out here as well yeah I think it offers you a
5:48:00
little bit more flexibility as well because you can pair a decent amount of stuff with the Jin and you can see
5:48:07
exactly what this bottom Lane is going to look like for DK as Sion the choice for shiu and it's
5:48:14
Braum for Barrel I like Braum I don't like this team comp
5:48:21
though I got to say yeah I mean cuz you have you have a you have
5:48:27
part dive part peel back that sign provides a little bit of
5:48:33
space as Bard makes a ton of sense I feel Bard's
5:48:39
really good into the Jinx specifically because she doesn't have a easy way to get out of the ultimate outside of the
5:48:46
flash I think T1 is going to be feeling amazing like these are basically full Comfort across the
5:48:52
board the composition has a good spread of damage team fighting solid and for DK
5:48:59
it does yet again feel like is it showmaker or Lucid early 2v2 or bust and
5:49:06
I guess aiming can carry but aiming on Jinx I have to see it before I believe it Valas even with the Brom to back them
5:49:12
up even with the front line she will want a tank as well I think T1 is going
5:49:17
to be feeling pretty good with this one yeah I mean you're playing Jinx into
5:49:23
Jax as well I mean there's just not a lot of good options into Jax Bard you already mentioned like aiming has got to
5:49:29
be picture perfect you're also in danger if you don't have flash of getting like a zir aled and stuff there's there's so
5:49:36
many different tools that T1 have on their comp I think they've done a better job here in game three of this Fearless
5:49:44
drafting system so yeah I mean you you've got
5:49:49
decent combos you know you you can kind of protect the carry a little bit and you've got a little bit of proactivity
5:49:55
and you've got a little bit of this but uh they haven't made the best they haven't cooked up the best you know
5:50:02
combo dish I think so very curious to see how it's going to go I think the
5:50:08
poppy is well going to get huge value yeah poppy into Ari and VI yeah that's the dream
5:50:14
scenario VES well we'll see if it plays out after this draft as we hop on the rift for
5:50:20
game number three
5:50:37
all right off we go and well one thing you've got you've got this Braum and
5:50:43
he's very good at level one so they're just going to run into the enemy
5:50:48
jungle and this time probably not going to get first
5:50:53
blooded like we saw in game one L swap to come through does make
5:51:00
sense chinard able to apply a ton of pressure in the 2v2
5:51:06
and Jinx just wants to get to at the very least an item if you really do anything I obviously it'd also much
5:51:12
rather be Aion and here you see as well both top laners are also aware that this
5:51:18
is the standard W placement cuz if Shu gets Dove which again a lot harder than it used to be isan he going to be able
5:51:24
to get the wave we've seen actually T1 CL and uh I think it was hble life as
5:51:30
well pulling out a lot of cion Lane swap strats where you use the Canon and just eventually send him to a death just that
5:51:37
you can maximize the amount of farm
5:51:43
now T1 the one thing I do think they have to be careful about which they do have a tendency to do sometimes is not
5:51:49
to over index too much on early plays cuz that's exactly what DK is going to be looking for as it looks like we will
5:51:56
just have some vertical jungling going on which I would argue benefits DK again
5:52:02
just because of how hard it is to reliably shut down a Scion
5:52:07
let's see honer still going to try but again these noxin turrets a little bit different than they used to it's going
5:52:13
to be a huge stacked wave about to come up actually she also went for shield
5:52:19
level one so not going for the C just trying to get as much experience as
5:52:26
possible yeah I mean he's he's getting a lot of experience he's going to hit level two and let's see if they've got
5:52:34
it can poppy do it in 2020 5 that is a nice stun to stop the que on the wave a
5:52:40
bit of damage comes in owner though not quite able to tank it up but there it is The Flash and the fourth shot from gooa
5:52:47
will get the kill on the hu who as you mentioned before just going to farm up the
5:52:52
wave meanwhile Doran just getting zoned out of his way not going to be taken down but T1 do get first blood and that
5:52:58
first speed of strength Jin killing a tank I never thought I'd see the DL but
5:53:04
does happen sh ends up going going down Doran is oh going to make it back to the
5:53:10
wave yeah got to be feeling really good about that one because there isn't really a dive opportunity here dive
5:53:16
number two good look for another one and I mean he doesn't have Flash
5:53:23
this time right but bit of damage comes in they're not 100% committing just yet
5:53:28
but the q's going to hit two but now that's the que down owner going to eat a turret shot and Canan doesn't really
5:53:34
have a lot of damage to trade back they're just kind ofy they're just kind of playing with the scon underneath this
5:53:40
turret the que is pretty good but it's not good enough Anda picks up a second
5:53:47
kill two kills there for the Jin we saw showmaker in attempted roam but it's not
5:53:52
going to lead to anything and even more they rotated over the butt Lane meaning
5:53:58
that this entire wave in top is going to be lost as well and DK everything
5:54:04
looking a bit disastrous early on t one you need to be a lot more careful as
5:54:10
we can see with the setup here to ensure that you actually take him down starts off with the B stun which sets up for
5:54:15
owner no opportunity for Shi and then that final Auto the chin crit comes
5:54:22
through and then I think here sh is trying to position in a way to both Dodge the damage from the Q on the
5:54:27
ground but also not getting stunned by Bard but unfortunately that Q uses there
5:54:33
it's kind of tough the problem is you can't really go for a full charge Q on until they have aggro because po can
5:54:38
cancel it so easily uh but you want to try and get it done anyway nice flash there from owner GMA just takes the one
5:54:44
shot are going to be at risk now early game looking really good here for T1
5:54:51
although thanks to that rotation it looks like uh took Doran a while to
5:54:56
actually arrive and he is basically even in experience but the plates are in
5:55:02
favor of DK which is why the gold still looks relatively even but the feet go going to T1 still going to be feeling
5:55:08
good about that one yeah I mean they get that first one the first blood and we'll
5:55:13
see if DK maybe can with some of this chip damage on the turrets uh find a way to pick up a first turret feet or if
5:55:22
it's uh just going to be that extra gold on Guma that gets the difference for T1
5:55:28
in some of those early team fights we might see around the grubs and so forth as now we've got top
5:55:34
laners fighting against each other and uh see I I hope he's not feeling too
5:55:40
bad about getting bullied under the turret I the new guy you must have known
5:55:45
what would have happened as long as he locked in s that is kind of resigning to the Fate yeah imagine uh this was 2024
5:55:53
and he was playing against peanut peanut would be there again I think he would have already been
5:55:59
there like four times yeah like peanut always does that to the rookies he's like y got to got to show them the way
5:56:06
it it goes here in the lck the other cost of this is that owner is severely underleveled he's about half a level
5:56:12
down on Lucid so there could be an opportunity to make a play here for DK don't know about lucid just yet but
5:56:20
yeah I think they should just dip just deny the initial grub make sure that they don't get free so they don't get
5:56:27
defeat I'm just going to leave it at that which I think is definitely the right call even with fakeer being available there trying to play into an
5:56:33
Ari at level six it's not really a risk there that you have to take yeah so two on they get that they
5:56:41
get away Doran seems to be doing quite well in this Lane he's been able to trade down to good amount he's got
5:56:49
demolish and he's going to elect not to use it maybe just worried about the wave
5:56:55
being cleared very fast and didn't want to overstay as welcome against the Scion was about to hit level six you
5:57:02
never know what that guy can do speaking of which Lucid up on the top side of the
5:57:08
map here oh found his way in but the problem is the wave is pushing into yeah I think
5:57:14
the back here is a good good call waves pushing into Guma and Kia Guma still has
5:57:19
a sums as well if he doesn't have sums you can maybe go for like a flash Q into Al but not going to be the case here not
5:57:26
really a window now sitting on a very early Bounty could not be further apart from
5:57:33
how his game number one started yeah it's a it's a very different feel
5:57:39
but it is Guma on Jin you know I mentioned kind of Faker and carry as the guys with the the Deep Champion pools
5:57:46
especially because these are just best of Threes now you know we we don't have to dig too deep we don't have to go too
5:57:52
crazy but certainly this is something that Kuma has played many a time and is very comfortable on as we do have the
5:57:58
rout here onto Barrel he is totally caught it might be a third for Gooma instead they'll just give that one to
5:58:04
Faker you know Goa miss the third shot so Pi is like yeah now I deserve it I'll take it down but more importantly than
5:58:11
the pick on a barrel it just means a free dragon here for T1 and they're really stacking up some
5:58:17
of these early wins for their team right now also takes oh that's good actually
5:58:25
oner doesn't have Smite so if that Splash damage could have actually realistically taken it not going to be
5:58:30
the case this also means that again an opportunity to fight is being denied
5:58:35
here for DK think DK wants to try and Skirmish around the particularly Braum Ari and by and they're not already going
5:58:42
to get an opportunity to K realistically in a mid to late game scenario is also just going to get beat up by either of
5:58:48
the side lanes that he's playing into I really wonder I think the problem
5:58:54
with the or is that you feel a lot more susceptible to those Dives but the dive works out anyway and I think or does
5:58:59
provide a lot more reliable values looking for a steal but she going to get spotted here and we'll have to get give
5:59:07
up baker has flash available and luid decides the better of it you I think you
5:59:14
can see the difference between how T1 was playing in game number uh one and game number two and three
5:59:21
it's so much more restraint uh really doesn't feel like it's the same team
5:59:28
playing yeah I mean it can happen you know first game of the season can kind of just go
5:59:34
Ary as car a Down down there at the bottom of the level XP not sure exactly
5:59:41
why we're highlighting that but he does have his alt available so there is that
5:59:47
Barrel just slightly ahead of him in terms of XP so setting up really good
5:59:52
vision coverage here with that invade now they have lucid full top side warded not allowing him as we go back take
5:59:59
another look here so barl is trying to set up for a play towards this Dragon but severely underestimates how many
6:00:05
members of T1 already and particularly these type of really aggressive plays around objectives with the Gen ultimate
6:00:11
we've seen T1 do a million times something that is basically their bread and butter as a result going to be both
6:00:18
that uh First Blood and the first objective First Blood of course secured a lot earlier but the first dragon also
6:00:25
going their way and also denying it to DK and DK they still have the Jinx which
6:00:31
is basically an insurance policy but it does feel like if mid jungle don't get
6:00:37
rolling all your eggs are in the Jinx basket and there's a lot of ways for T1 to shut that down between the Bal
6:00:43
between Faker going for a big swoop owner getting on the back line Doran flanks on the jack so this Skirmish
6:00:49
going to be a big one for DK and I think T1 might also opt to just let it go I
6:00:55
mean Baker still in Top Lane he could TP if they really wanted to take it like
6:01:00
immediately but it does look like they're just going to give this one away DK will pick up five
6:01:06
grubs so at least at least they've got that but they're not the team that has a
6:01:12
Jax in a side lane you know they're they're not the team that has a very powerful Sid laning champ you know AR's
6:01:19
more of like a combo duo with the vi so you got all these grubs but hey not
6:01:26
despite the two kills aiming still up in Gold just sticked over Val the gold King
6:01:33
yeah it was crowned last year I don't know if it's enough but it's
6:01:39
something Baker and Gooma both in an incredible spot imagine Guma should be
6:01:44
getting his collector pretty soon shiu meanwhile has
6:01:50
obviously fallen behind due to the early game shenanigans that T1 was able to
6:01:56
pull off Lan's now done for showmaker as well and we saw
6:02:02
even there in the previous play when they were contesting for the uh grubs she actually walked towards basically
6:02:08
the entrance of the Dragon pit and was just like standing there was like I need to wasn't a contest so no need for him
6:02:15
to rotate over yeah and the vision being secured carry
6:02:22
out with the Deep Ward and let me tell you that extra Health it's annoying
6:02:28
actually much more than you would initially think yeah but he missed the brush well yeah I mean that Ward doesn't
6:02:33
do a lot it was just taken as an opportunity uhoh okay well we're going extremely
6:02:40
deep for this one it still works though it's still RI the question is can they trade back on this is The Flash Al from
6:02:47
owner it's not going to do a whole lot but keeping loose it around Barrel in a rough spot but he's fromom and now per
6:02:54
is going to go down and all of a sudden DK begin to win this fight Doran gets
6:03:00
aled by Shu who comes down a left field essentially and now they're going to get
6:03:06
the first turret how the hell did that work they went to nardia and back and
6:03:14
this play still worked out just kill Baker and force T1 to over
6:03:21
fight I guess I I got to see this replay because owner like flashed the wall he
6:03:27
really wanted to keep them around he flashed the wall he Ed them to try to keep them in place but already Lucid had
6:03:33
flashed away and it was only braw and they're like don't want to kill prom and then they just expend everything to go
6:03:40
way too deep and DK immediately take advantage of it okay so let's let's take another look here
6:03:46
so it's a full Shuffle and then also Flash and yes they kill Faker The Flash
6:03:53
is Big cuz it means Lucid doesn't get slammed into the turret then he also is able to get away but then I want you to
6:03:58
pay attention to this Lucid doesn't actually get threatened by the bar and then Barrel gets the cancel on the Jin
6:04:03
out so Jin is out of the fight carry has way too deep owner wasn't able to join your biggest UT damage Choice which is
6:04:09
Faker died at the beginning of the play and all of a sudden DK P the round they
6:04:16
really do barrel is ecstatic after that one it could not have gone better oh I I
6:04:21
I guess you could have AC them but yeah it was essentially just T1 they do this
6:04:26
thing where it's like okay well you know we're going to trade in some way we really need to trade this one back speak
6:04:32
of trading that's going to be a steal so not a great trade for owner as he will
6:04:38
lose his red buff losing yeah he got away from that uh poal and then K used his alt on him and
6:04:45
then went over the wall and just died so Bard just had zero impact it's like well
6:04:50
that's not what we wanted to use the bar for not not to try to punish the vine that went a bit too deep it's it's to
6:04:56
try to kill the Jinx most likely and to provide a good Lane with the Jin so very
6:05:03
kind of all over the place team fight for T1 and DK were immediately there to pick up the
6:05:09
scraps so now this game has gotten a lot more interesting because you know it kind of felt like T1 they were slowly
6:05:16
but surely winning the early game it looked a little bit like game two you know they're getting all the objectives
6:05:22
uh nice timing there actually but see flash in the wall this guy is insane and you know
6:05:29
with with showmaker coming up nice charm bit of damage in the malignus ticking but okay engage Braum Barrel getting in
6:05:38
the rest of the team joining in DK going crazy what are they doing I don't know
6:05:44
not a lot giving a free turret to Doran question mark um yeah she is indeed uh
6:05:51
kind of crazy that was a that was a sequence of plays but it was all for the greater good if they get a kill there as
6:05:57
well plus the turret I think they're going to be feeling a lot better cuz now they did invest a good amount showmakers
6:06:03
uh TP as well as use Flash but you get the one for one trade
6:06:09
so still not the end of the world and that could have gone a lot better then again I I kind of saw at the beginning
6:06:15
of that play and it really does feel like DK at worst at least are aligned that
6:06:21
going extremely ham is the plan and when you think about we talked about this Jinx in that Classic front to back
6:06:27
composition can also look at it as a reset comp right where as soon as aiming gets an assist the duo BL show and Shu
6:06:36
creates so much space that as long as he gets anything going with the movement speed maybe it can be a bigger impact in
6:06:42
fights than we initially fought because T1 is just going to be the one playing on the back foot and in these few fights has been
6:06:50
the case now Feats are dead even We Are One objective away for either team it's
6:06:56
going to be the dragon in about a minute and I think that that might be where the game ends up not necessarily decided
6:07:02
with how it's been going thus far but uh uh CH Ste on the Chompers there's the
6:07:08
charm Lucid just totally wide on that one and he might get punished for it everybody's flashing away now aiming
6:07:15
nearly getting sniped there with third bullet but he will just barely get away
6:07:21
so now he doesn't have cleanse or Flash against Bard azir and all the threats on the side of
6:07:28
T that that might have ending the side of the game because it looks like they were trying to get the force of at least
6:07:34
the sums out of Guma and instead aiming now doesn't have sums for the upcoming fight again the game in about a minute
6:07:40
either team is going to get Feats it's not really about the Feats but either DK starts stacking dragons or T1 gets Soul
6:07:46
point this early on in the game and aiming not having his sums available especially cuz it looks like he's most
6:07:51
likely going to hit his two item power spike is a really big deal and Guma didn't have to expand anything right the
6:07:57
only thing T1 used there was was old cool Downs which they will all have available back when the fight starts
6:08:03
that's a charm that's a rip car and yeah owner right there to try to punish it Barrel in a bit of trouble but he is
6:08:11
Brom and now Lo it oh if the Q hits I mean you got Rockets flying you press an
6:08:17
R button but Guma still has his flash yeah that's both aiming and showmaker
6:08:24
old now used oh good charm but yeah T1 is taking
6:08:31
control of this pit and this does feel like DK they can choose not to fight here it's not so it's just sole point
6:08:37
but you're still going to be feeling horrible but look at the vision that's being set up here by T1 feel like you can just never approach her if you're DK
6:08:44
entire jungle is lit up still might be able to gain entrance
6:08:51
through the river but they're going to have to get a crazy catch to make this work the zoom in there on both the zap and the charm not going to
6:08:58
connect what about lucid that's a poppy if you pick the right target maybe yeah
6:09:04
and you got to hope that is not ready is is are we just going to have Shield run in is that is that what this is going to
6:09:11
devolve into I could see it Go engage you SS are available owner doesn't have
6:09:16
his ultimate crucially so keeping Lucid out of the pit might be hard dor on the flank does get
6:09:21
spotted all right let's see how it goes Lucid looking for the flash can he get
6:09:27
it yes he will Lucid picks it up denies the dragon now they're turning on a door
6:09:33
in and The Counter Strike can only do so much he gets extremely low and the rocket gets the reset in go aiming he is
6:09:40
chasing them down he's got a front line very nice old here from Baker but it's not enough it will just block the door
6:09:46
aaria it's not long for the world either it is a massacre T1 are just running
6:09:53
away they lose the dragon they lose the Feats of Strength and DK they find the
6:09:58
all the angles everything goes wrong there vales if you get the dragon you give up The
6:10:04
Kills I think you say worth getting soulle Point mountain that's going to feel amazing Against The Upfront burst
6:10:11
of this comp are they going to get oton as well oh my uh they have two TPS
6:10:17
faker's up in five but I don't think he's going to be in time they're going to get that as well yeah and just like that you you were
6:10:24
talking about the the dragon being the game decider it kind of is it kind of is oh
6:10:31
want want to look at this so it's the burst Lucid gets it and then air an initial re-engage with the ble but
6:10:37
that's bramman canion no one can join and then Lucid turns on to Doran and as
6:10:43
soon as aiming gets that old the splash damage he gets excited there's no way that the fight is winable even with fer
6:10:49
nice attempt there on the shuffle Pumas uh unfortunately this is level two so he can't kill the Sion so he's just
6:10:57
standing there sadly let's go let's go go let's go
6:11:06
KH let's go is the message he said that like five times and now they've got the
6:11:11
buff it's got to be a quick turnarounds here with the buff you're going to be looking to dive and you know as you
6:11:17
framed it before ooh that's a denial on the back of owner I think he was aiming for Faker but minute and a
6:11:25
half said before you know just get some resets get a dive
6:11:30
going there's really not much that T1 can do to stop
6:11:37
this uh you know maybe use the ble to buy some time I'm not sure because DK
6:11:42
are just begging T1 to step up to give any angle at all and Barrel's just going
6:11:48
to hold up the door Lucid will get away and not expend his arakan buff I ideally
6:11:55
you just want to get an R off and then if you die it's you know GIS might go for it here I don't know if he gets his
6:12:02
R off though as yeah he's roed and and well yeah okay there's the revive in go
6:12:09
very nice engage actually but the followup is non-existent bit of damage on auma though they got Gooma and that
6:12:14
is the most important part as everybody else just going to maybe go down owner
6:12:20
nearly burning not going to happen so they got Guma now the issue with this is
6:12:26
you know it was good but there's no objective really after getting Guma so
6:12:31
yeah they don't really get anything out of it but there wasn't going to be an objective within the time so yeah let's
6:12:36
try and get some value uh definitely not the best look I feel like teams right
6:12:42
now are really going Mega am and you want to trade like at least two kills
6:12:48
ideally to really feel like this is worth it uh cuz the sums are already down you're not getting a turret you're
6:12:54
not getting any other objective but then again you're going to lose the buff anyway but I'd argue there are scenarios
6:13:00
where it might be better to lose the buff cuz you're still giving over gold like I know it's not nearly as much much
6:13:06
but in this case cuz you got the Guma I'm pretty sure was sitting on a shutdown as well in this case it's
6:13:12
definitely still a worthwhile trade as yeah showmaker has been having a series
6:13:18
eles potential player of the match angle if uh DK eventually win this spawn yeah
6:13:25
it's not over until the Nexus Falls T1 haven't lost an in yet they are still sitting at two dragons so they're
6:13:32
they're going to have a lot of time I think Goa needs to get to a third it though Faker is sitting at a really
6:13:38
strong one two but I don't know if that alone is going to be enough to hold off on The Siege
6:13:46
here if DK do actually start stacking these mountains think can get kind of ugly though I think she was going to be
6:13:54
uh going to be a problem he already has 4K Health out there he he has one
6:14:02
item yeah and they have a Jin they have a Jin they do I know I know that there's also
6:14:09
air there's also Jax but if air and Jax are hitting Canon I don't I I don't think that's where you
6:14:15
want to be in in life yeah at least it does feel like Faker builds and will do
6:14:21
damage oh he's going void as well it looks like next so leandre's void should be he's going to be the guy that's
6:14:26
chewing through it uh looking for Goa here he is going to be caught for now flashes the Poo just gets away from it
6:14:33
entirely loci it you can always rely on this guy and down will go the t180 carry Lucid I just said
6:14:42
we can rely on you please don't just immediately die okay he's just dead and uh showmaker probably did as well there
6:14:49
you go T1 a couple of big picks and baron is about to spawn and so is that
6:14:54
mountain Drake up and available yeah that's soulle point to T1 remember how I said he was
6:15:03
reliable oh d okay never change uh T1 smell a moment of weakness and go in
6:15:11
just to pick on Gooma was great uh but DK can't help but over Chase in this
6:15:17
case Lucid going way to him and this initial play is so nicely done right get
6:15:22
the Y take down Guma flash away showmaker at the ready and this gets you
6:15:28
a second Drake at the nice Soul point and you don't need to do more you don't need to go for owner but then Lucid just
6:15:35
use into the waiting arms of Doran uh really nicely done there as well by the
6:15:40
way from car to ensure that barrel and showmaker can't provide any assistance
6:15:46
and that is now Mountain Soul Point meaning that this game that we we
6:15:51
thought was now finally really swinging between the dragon and then the adakan as
6:15:56
well handum still going BAS
6:16:05
I mean it's really anybody's game from here I I do think that the baron is going to be an
6:16:12
interesting point of contention you know how strong can Doran get as well to really Force his way in those side Lanes
6:16:20
like I'm not sure he can do much against the canion he's never really going to get a kill and ch's never going to
6:16:26
attack him when it comes to hyper carries aiming is doing actually pretty well I don't think that T1 have done a
6:16:32
great job of locking down aiming there was one ble to hit him and now um he's
6:16:38
got to deal with a very fed Sion and he's going to have to blast from yeah
6:16:44
Flash and cleanse from the sign he like just how did he wasn't even
6:16:51
in bot Lane he was running through the T1 jungle looking for the flank the entire that's the only reason drifting
6:16:58
that's the only reason he was in that position at all that's just who does that this guy is a Madman okay TB is
6:17:05
forced this is the moment T1 looking for a collapse oh B going to miss and I think
6:17:13
for DK all you got to do is is find Guma the issue though is if you get Guma like
6:17:18
yeah you got to sums and everything but as you mentioned before it's really Faker and Doran who are kind of the hyper carries in this Cal so you can't
6:17:26
expend everything to get Guma see all the Poke actually being pretty meaningful as that Lu is going in I I I
6:17:35
don't know what she was bringing out in this map but I have not seen this Lucid since spring vales Lucid was talking to
6:17:40
diao before this game he's like how do I how do I do what you did how can I be
6:17:45
that aggressive with the sums still going to be down or the sums are still going to
6:17:51
be down but T1 have bought themselves so much time by picking up that Dragon again the big mistake from Lucid meaning
6:17:57
that there is not going to be an opportunity for DK to set up themselves for soul point this game might go to
6:18:03
distance Baron is still up and I got to be careful saying that because I've said
6:18:09
that before and then there's like a five for zero and the game is over but the game is going to stand with for T1 it's
6:18:16
very straightforward we're getting to the point in the game where the the damage from lucid and showmaker
6:18:22
shouldn't be enough unless someone is really out of position so it's going to come down to K we kill Amy that man is
6:18:27
about to hit his iie about to hit four items has been unchecked this entire game and I think the issue is as you're
6:18:33
saying I'm sure T1 wor like they are not getting any space to get on aiming
6:18:39
because lucid and showmaker and even the Scion are diving so deep onto the enemy backline
6:18:46
yeah and if you trade and aiming as a sumps and your carry ends up going down that fight is going to end up going
6:18:53
the way that you want it to what a game Val this what a series
6:19:00
yeah I'm just really glad that we're getting some very high level action here in game three
6:19:05
at least between two very strong teams I was a little bit worried after game one to be honest that was uh that was weird
6:19:14
T1 lost very unceremoniously DK have been challenged
6:19:20
though since then and we weren't too satisfied with their draft either we we
6:19:25
began to see some angles of how they were able to make it work you know I was saying before that
6:19:31
Gooma doesn't matter too much but if aiming there and he gets a said onuma at least then maybe he can duel with Faker
6:19:38
they're just going to go for their own T1 Baron this is a DK Baron but now
6:19:44
there is Vision no flank this time you imagine the DK is going to be looking for the
6:19:50
turn see how it goes Doran going very far forward into the Braum as oh they
6:19:56
get the lock down there on ad Doran and the front line owners is burst 100 to zero that's Go's doing some nice work
6:20:02
but there is the Al from fer gets it but look at aiming he's totally untouched
6:20:07
the entire time aiming gets the resets goba is alone and he is dead and there
6:20:14
you go TK take a huge fight they're going to they might look for the end it's only Doran alive there is a wave I
6:20:21
don't think that they can but we'll see yeah it looks like they are still contemplating as well CH ended up going
6:20:29
down in that extended fight as well they at the very least we be able to get the inap we'll see if they actually Cho
6:20:34
choing to push on can also and I think should back off get that Dragon looks like that's going to be the case here
6:20:40
instead get the inhib but what a Fight Win there from
6:20:47
DK as we take a look at this one sh able to dodge away the Bold again not really
6:20:53
hitting and then Dorne gets tagged the bra mode is there and it looks like a disaster when he uses his o or his
6:21:00
stopwatch but it doesn't matter there's still enough damage Lucid flashes over the
6:21:05
and aiming crucially does as well aiming stays alive throughout all of it and if the Jinx doesn't die you can't win the
6:21:12
fight they need to get the Jinx and if aiming has Flash and you don't have
6:21:18
control of these objectives like T1 do not there's not a lot of good ways to get his flash really K has got to like
6:21:25
snipe him with this B Al otherwise but it's got to be Faker but if he's got
6:21:31
flash he just flash it but this is still not enough cuz they only get drag like they win the fight yes but it's fre a
6:21:36
gold at 31 minutes not going to be the end of the world the mid inip also not the best inip that you can get
6:21:42
definitely the one lowest in value yeah I feel like they should just
6:21:49
regroup and and look at Baron again I mean yeah the only they would the only real issue is that aiming doesn't have a
6:21:56
flash now so you know obviously fer can still try to shuffle and find an angle
6:22:01
Faker doesn't have his flash for the best angle but yeah that's that's the precarious thing because if K actually
6:22:07
does get n on to aiming and he gets clipped the setup afterwards is
6:22:14
basically impossible to play around Lucid now gets his GA further solidifying that he is just looking to
6:22:21
go in and isolate a single Target cuz all that DK needs is they just need to
6:22:26
get aiming excited even if it's a situation where at eventually they're
6:22:32
able to take him down if he can get enough holds of this is a four and zero Jinx four items now Lord Dums iie all
6:22:39
there Lucid just waiting biting his
6:22:45
time T1 dare I say T1 Baron yeah they're
6:22:51
going to start it I mean they've got a lot of damage with the azir especially they've got Jin very safe positioning
6:22:57
here dpsing literally with his alt Barrel is though here in the front line
6:23:03
and there goes the J and this fight is early from owner it's desperation for T1
6:23:09
down goes the Jacks will T1 get away oh the CH H Faker the max range did they go
6:23:14
too deep though is the question there's the ga though for the vi I think it's enough here for DK they get a couple of
6:23:20
kills they get an excited Jinx and they want this game they want this series
6:23:26
right here right now no one saw it but Atlas but we are on the verge of a DK win oh Barrel the
6:23:34
engage Brom The Flash to Q Goa doesn't even flash or cleanse but
6:23:41
I don't think it matters the Mam's aside it looks like DK they should be able to take it down Goa can't clear the waves
6:23:48
especially not on Jin Cara they take down the vi and that is all they will
6:23:54
get as D plus Kia takes the 2-1 victory over T1
6:24:00
tonight and they get another win here for group Elder feeling pretty good after this gigantic
6:24:12
win you can only imagine Lucid is going to feel a little sheepish after uh he
6:24:17
went way to H and put them in a position that was a bit harder to play out as I'm
6:24:22
I'm kind of at a loss for for pom in this one uh but DK remember it took them
6:24:29
years to finally beat a team higher ranked than them when they were playing against T1 and now in the first match
6:24:37
able to get the win in his debut see you doesn't know what to do he's like I don't know I just
6:24:44
I just play League of Legends he he played fantastically I mean she was great showmaker was great I
6:24:51
wouldn't even mind an Aiming vat I I don't I I probably wouldn't go for him personally
6:24:57
but it's it was a team effort you know game two a little bit wonky you know T1
6:25:03
got a little a little bit too far ahead and uh yeah Shaker's got all of
6:25:09
the uh he's got all of the celebrations
6:25:15
here aiming as well they got to teach sh some celebrations for the future though and
6:25:23
with that team Elder going to take a lead as well as T1 not able to get the win and
6:25:33
this is where the DK win started with a play that by no account I think should
6:25:40
have worked but they made it work anyway bar on the Brum I think also doing an exceptional job in
6:25:46
T1 not looking like the well-oiled machine even in game number two I think we saw a lot more glimpses of that but
6:25:53
in this one even with all the comfort in the world and a couple of great early Dives set up by owner and the bot Lane
6:26:00
the smites weren't quite there and the team fighting from DK just fell so much more crisp as we see the snap engages in
6:26:08
decision making and I couldn't really give him the vote but what a debut from
6:26:13
Shu as well man the man made look can look engaging and outside of of bous
6:26:19
streams that there haven't been a lot of players that been able to do that it's very true I I think he had an excellent
6:26:25
SC game and uh his ambessa game also fantastic so really really got to give
6:26:30
him a big shout out this is a huge stage against team one so many nerves that
6:26:36
goes into this for him but he was still able to play an excellent series he even got Dove a couple of times made to look
6:26:42
a little embarrassed he didn't care he knew what his job
6:26:49
was they're looking for
6:26:56
JA they said don't go over and then immediately Lucid took the portal I'm pretty sure that's what they
6:27:02
said but uh either
6:27:08
way Luc was able to get the 40er and
6:27:15
uh I don't want to focus up he
6:27:20
says I'm going to go in please follow says Barrel please play Slowly the rest of
6:27:28
the team I don't think this DK is going to do a lot of slow playing no sh doesn't
6:27:35
want to focus up he just wants to play these kinds of games that are wild and
6:27:41
crazy L the charm
6:27:47
nice I think Lucid said sorry for something I wouldn't I wonder I wonder
6:27:52
what it could be um yeah well there you showmaker doing the
6:27:59
most okay that makes me I I did end up going for showmaker yeah cuz I think it's Jason I think that's Fair yeah I
6:28:05
there's a lot of good votes this time around what a series and I'm said it's not the best of five can you imagine
6:28:12
we'll have them Fearless we'll have the Fearless best of fives they'll happen here at the 2025 lck cup eventually uh
6:28:20
not during the group stage though but yeah it's it's really cool we've seen a lot of weird stuff already we saw the zerth probably not going to see that
6:28:27
again no that's okay but but we saw it that was cool we saw brand we saw brand
6:28:33
that happened we got to play the match ready who is it going to be this time around it will be aimy who does pick it
6:28:39
up as uh you know I would say his game three he would be be he would be my P
6:28:46
actually no I cuz that's him or Lucid but Lucid inted the one time so like can you really vote for him I think aiming
6:28:52
sinks play was absolutely Flawless yeah it's nothing easy in to play I agree and it's this is for a guy that we've given
6:28:59
a little Fleck for not being able to play these moments he played it really well well you got the interview on stage
6:29:04
ready to go in just a little bit and we are going to be hearing from the man himself uh am curious to see what he has
6:29:10
to say about uh you know even the Ezreal game that he got to play very early on
6:29:17
um yeah I mean there were a lot of choices I I don't think that aiming would have been my P but yeah it's okay
6:29:24
it's fine I'm I'm expecting a a split vote as well which I think is fair there were a lot of moments Luc said bar the
6:29:31
one play had a good one even she would the best at game absolutely well guys we do have the interview on stage let's
6:29:36
throw it to Dear for the translation now thank you very much guys this is for
6:29:44
the P interview translation of 2025 lck cups match number four joined by Amy on
6:29:50
the side of now group Elder has secured their
6:29:59
third how do you feel after defeating T1 starting the LC cup with a victory is
6:30:07
actually such a great thing and I think us having a great contribution to team
6:30:12
group alra is also making me very happy and the reunion with barl and Sh call
6:30:21
many people are excited for D+ Kia so just from your first Cup match you guys display some high
6:30:29
performance yeah I think it went pretty well I think uh on stage we have high
6:30:34
levels of confidence right now and since call up there's been a lot of
6:30:41
expectations for him was he
6:30:51
nervous I
6:30:57
think was actually more nervous today I think she was actually doing
6:31:02
really well and I believe that he will grow to be a even better player so I
6:31:08
will support
6:31:13
you and the blind Pi in game one and thei in game three it feel like you guys
6:31:20
are ready for Fearless draft so what's your impression on Fearless draft and how now that you guys played on stage I
6:31:28
think we have so much to think of when it comes to Fearless tra and I think we
6:31:33
just have to be ready to pick some picks that we are not exactly confident
6:31:40
in or comfortable with with with full of
6:31:46
confidence I think right now with the choices that ad carries get we have
6:31:51
limited mobility and limited choices so it actually makes me think a
6:31:59
lot and what would you like to Showcase in the rest of LC cup
6:32:04
and last season I got the gold King award and it made me really happy so I
6:32:09
think if I were to get another opportunity I want to aim for gold King award
6:32:16
again did shout
6:32:22
out figh you know thinking
6:32:29
about group Elder and group Baron I realized today
6:32:35
in the later half of the game group Elder Elder was actually better than baren so let's go group Elder and that's
6:32:43
the end of the interview with aiming and back to the space thank
6:32:49
you thank you very much dear and that's right based on the score it is let's go
6:32:55
group Elder as they go up 3 to one thanks to D+ Kia's win over T1 here 2
6:33:01
to1 in game number three welcome back to the space gone alongside W did and Ox to close things out here and as we always
6:33:08
do after a series player of the match going to aiming it was a close vote
6:33:14
because it was split all the way across here so I want to get your thoughts on this W did yeah I personally bought it
6:33:19
for buriel because I think uh barel kind of filled up the missing po part of the
6:33:25
DK once again yeah it shows that DK finally found the var's replacement and it's old the varal you know uh we could
6:33:32
see some proactive plays from him and also he's helping uh rukie jungler he's
6:33:37
not rukie anymore but he's still young so it's really good to see him back again yeah I just feel like it's great
6:33:43
to see a the team have such like a driving force you know and really feel like they're not afraid to make plays uh
6:33:48
it feels like it's been a long time since we've had that even when D Plus have been playing well previously I feel
6:33:53
like there's just such a difference when you have a player like baral his experience in the team so really good to see and you know the vote was very split
6:34:00
there was a vote for literally everyone and I think that's Justified I think everyone had their moments in the series with they Sean yeah this was a series
6:34:06
where everyone was pretty I guess it was a close series throughout and we were kind of wondering who was going to going
6:34:12
to step up and make the big play and you could see showmaker getting some shout outs as well from the Korean broadcast
6:34:19
Cloud Templar with an ADC like this I can play tank all day less less poetic this time but straight to the point by
6:34:25
Cloud Templar at the start in the Finish there was the gold Kink that's right aiming the udy bank gold King from last
6:34:31
season already shouted it out in his first in interview uh so aiming getting it started off well here with the player
6:34:38
of the match now let's take a look at some of the highlights here because this one was the closest game of the series
6:34:44
and this fight here at Drake was when it finally started to swing one way and I think it's really hard cuz as soon as
6:34:49
someone goes down on the side of T1 you have so much momentum given over from the vi and the Jinx and it makes fights
6:34:55
really difficult to navigate and you have a Jin who just struggles to cut through so here Guma was hitting the saion not really doing much and as soon
6:35:02
as that first reset comes in the momentum is just so heavily in favor you see Faker tries to make something off it
6:35:08
but his his Shuffle doesn't connect onto the Jinx and it's just clean up time with show getting all those kills I mean
6:35:14
basically DK's team comp is so much better they can tank they can also
6:35:19
engage and also they deal the damage but when you think about the T1 comp you have to some kind of like flank with ja
6:35:26
and looking for super plays with azir but you don't have a front line damage so I feel like their draft was kind of
6:35:32
like off uh compared to DK yeah a little bit harder to execute the vi was kept away from Lucid throughout the series
6:35:39
when he got it he made some plays here then up a big big fight by Baron baited out by D+ and it just once again feels
6:35:45
quite awkward you know they're trying to buy space and then Doren has to use his Z oner goes down and return fer has to
6:35:52
try and find a big Shuffle that's really the only angle they have but we see a great Flash from aiming and again goom
6:35:58
is just trying to deal damage but it takes so long to cut through the scon takes so long to kill form takes so long
6:36:04
for Jin to kill and it's just clean up time once again yeah I mean back in the day we couldn't really uh blame the
6:36:10
coaches uh from the bad band picks but I feel like nowadays you can actually
6:36:16
blame the coaches from the band picks because it's a fear lless I don't think players can take uh the time to think
6:36:22
about the draft a lot so it feels like it's uh all about the coaching staffs and also uh more like how you think
6:36:29
about the team comp but yeah this time around I feel like they just out I mean they were just like really really bad on
6:36:36
the draft uh in the last game yeah I feel like a lot of time in the lck we've had like our core strong picks and the drafts haven't been that varied it's
6:36:42
like okay what picks are good for you what are good for them generally stick to those but with Fearless especially when it's coming to these game threes
6:36:48
we're seeing teams pushed a bit more and some teams when you just look at the comp as a whole you like I don't see the
6:36:53
cohesion I don't see the logic and then some comps it's like that D+ comp just plays itself yeah one fun fact all the
6:37:00
kings from sktt1 wins against t won so maybe uh next time around they can win
6:37:07
but this time around yeah right coach Beni getting the victory there with the plus Kia the new coach on over there
6:37:14
let's take a look at the standings as we finally at the end of the day have a leader in the group battles it is group
6:37:20
Elder with a two day against group Baron as T1 and bnk FX fall against KT and D
6:37:29
plus respectively this put a lot of pressure on H life Esports you know they they have to represent present their group as the one who are the the top
6:37:36
team from group Baron and they'll be going up against gen G and can I really need that win to secure it yeah remember
6:37:41
all the teams in the losing side at best get to play in play-ins and at worst are
6:37:47
knocked out of the lck cup so come on Bros we need we need a couple wins Bros let's let's get ourselves on out of
6:37:53
there as uh we take a look at the matches for tomorrow where it's the big
6:37:58
one the rematch of the lck finals summer split 2024 Hana life Esports and ji do
6:38:07
battle and then the Bros take the rift one more time against Nong shim as we start the second matches final thoughts
6:38:13
here on today where we got to see a lot of debuts by players new faces new places who stood out to you the most
6:38:20
here Ox I think SE had a really good series um I think ultimately like it's not a surprise that DK often start off
6:38:26
well and we've seen all the other players play well but he he kind of just fit in and it didn't seem like there was a notable like oh we have an issue with
6:38:33
playing but we're accommodating it the whole team felt good so it's a good start for him I mean for me it's burial
6:38:39
once again because uh DK was missing one part that they need some proactive and
6:38:45
uh they really need the some kind of engage support has no fear and it's
6:38:50
burial once again and I feel like the DK the team color is always being like so
6:38:55
fun to watch and once again showmaker makes so much difference between uh the
6:39:02
games and barrial showmaker playing together is like always fun to watch now ax in the earlier series KTB and K FX
6:39:09
who stood out for you both good and bad and just moments to build upon here um I
6:39:15
mean honestly I feel like because bdd Duo like bdd had a good series overall
6:39:20
obviously Jing with that uh play of the match but I think with the form bdd was in uh last year at the end of last year
6:39:27
and also cuz generally I really expect great things so you know they won the series it's a good start but losing the
6:39:32
game against BK K Rex I think if this team is going to challenge the top rosters it's going to be that mid jungle Duo so we saw some good L signs for them
6:39:39
but I want to see Excellence SC forwards yeah I'm wondering if someone is going to found the find a solution on VI
6:39:46
because uh a lot of team just banned VI but the T1 tried to open it but it seems
6:39:52
like it's just a broken Champion all right well a lot of debuts have been handed out here in the first two days of
6:39:57
the lck but we've got two teams still left to show what they've got for the first time in the 2025 season Hana life
6:40:04
Esports and gen will have that match for you tomorrow so make sure you don't miss it on behalf of everyone here in the lck
6:40:11
