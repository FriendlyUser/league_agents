Patch Highlights

Arcane Fractured Jinx, Arcane Professor Heimerdinger, Arcane Savior Viktor, Arcane Vander Warwick, and Arcane Last Stand Ekko will be available December 11, 2024 at 20:00 UTC.
AFK Detection Improvements
Starting in patch 14.24, we'll be improving our AFK detection which tracks if players are active. Now, players will be considered AFK if they are idling in the fountain for an extended period of time at any moment during the course of the game. This means early surrender will also be available to players who find themselves in a match with a teammate idling in the fountain.
Sanctum and the Mythic Shop
With patch 14.24 The Sanctum is live and with it our first Exalted skin, Arcane Fractured Jinx. In case you missed it we put out an article about the Sanctum, Exalted Skins, and how to get them a bit ago.
The Mythic Shop this patch is getting a major facelift and content rework to account for a lot of the changes we're making both in new things to get (Exalted Skins and Nexus Finishers), removing a few redundancies, or things you never spent ME on in the first place. We're also using it to reintroduce a handful of things you've been asking for us to bring back for awhile (Legacy Skins, Event Chromas, and Emotes)! So those long lost items you've been wanting to collect that haven't seen the light of the client in years? You'll have a way to obtain them again.
Just to lay it out there The Sanctum will serve as the new primary way to acquire Mythic Essence, you can spend that Mythic Essence in the shop for premium content (new and old Prestige skins, legacy content, etc.). You'll notice a couple of things missing from the Mythic Shop offerings such as exchanging Mythic Essence for Blue Essence, Orange Essence, or Skin Shards. These were either rarely purchased or didn't fit around the philosophy of focusing Mythic Essence towards exclusive content. 
Viktor Update

Join the glorious evolution.
Viktor's evolution hits the Rift this patch with an update to better line up his design between League and Arcane. This update enhanced visuals, some new splash arts, and a few gameplay adjustments.
Nexus Finishers

We have a new type of content coming to the Mythic Shop this patch, introducing Nexus Finishers! Nexus Finishers are a new way to style on your opponents (and your allies) with custom VFX, SFX animations and more. At the very end of the match, a randomly selected player from the winning team's equipped Finisher will play, visible to everyone in the match. While this first one is themed after Jinx and Arcane, future ones will not always be directly related to a skin. You can equip Nexus Finishers for use with ANY champion or skin you have selected. The first Nexus Finisher will be available in the Mythic Shop at 250 ME for the duration of this event.
Champions

Ambessa
W shield duration and value decreased. E damage decreased.

Ambessa is still looking a bit strong after her adjustments last patch, specifically in the hands of players in higher skill brackets. One of the issues she's facing in particular is that she doesn't have enough losing lane match ups, so we're looking to introduce more this patch, specifically ones that are DPS-focused stat checkers, as they should have the edge on Ambessa.
W - Repudiation
Shield Duration: 2 ⇒
1.5 seconds

Shield Value: 85-350 (based on level) (+175% bonus AD) ⇒
50-320 (based on level) (+150% bonus AD)

E - Lacerate
Damage: 40/65/90/115/140 (+40/50/60/70/80% bonus AD) ⇒
40/65/90/115/140 (+40/45/50/55/60% bonus AD)


Corki
E damage decreased.

Corki was reworked as a straightforward lane bully, and though he's succeeding on that front he's doing much too well in the early game. We want Corki players to do more than simply press buttons while marching forward to win their lanes, so we're dropping a bit of his early game damage so that the answer to "when to go in" isn't "always."
E - Gatling Gun
Damage: 100/150/200/250/300 (+250% bonus AD) ⇒
80/130/180/230/280 (+240% bonus AD)


Elise
Base health decreased.

Elise has been doing very well as of late, especially in higher skill brackets where her early dominance more reliably leads to game-ending leads. We think it's important to preserve her high burst assassination power, so we're reducing her early game by giving other players room to fight back and possibly fend her off or outright kill her.
Base Stats
Base Health: 650 ⇒
620


Graves
Q secondary damage decreased.

Graves was meaningfully nerfed last patch when we addressed The Collector and the ranged version of Youmuu's Ghostblade. Despite that, he's still climbing the jungle charts, especially in higher skill brackets. In this patch we're bringing down his burst damage in order to extend his trading patterns and to give his opponents more room for counterplay.
Q - End of the Line
Initial Damage: 45 / 65 / 85 / 105 / 125 (+ 80% bonus AD) ⇒
Unchanged

Secondary Damage: 85/120/155/190/225 (+40/70/100/130/160% bonus AD) ⇒
85/120/155/190/225 (+40/65/90/115/140% bonus AD)


LeBlanc
Q damage decreased.

LeBlanc has a high ban rate right now, but her win rate isn't far off from being reasonable, so we're lightly nerfing her to reduce how frustrating she can be to play against. We're specifically targeting her early game since she's particularly strong in higher skill brackets there and she already doesn't scale very well.
Q - Sigil of Malice
Damage: 70/95/120/145/170 (+ 40% AP) ⇒
65/90/115/140/165 (+40% AP)


Master Yi
Q critical strike scaling increased.

We're buffing critical strike on Master Yi this patch with the primary goal of re-introducing crit as an alternate build. We intend, and expect, his primary build to still be on-hit, which isn't being touched with this buff, so this is for everyone who enjoys item builds from 2009. We're also delivering a small change that makes it more apparent what your total damage to an enemy is.
Q - Alpha Strike
Critical Strike Scaling: 35%, 49% with Infinity Edge ⇒
56.25%, 86.25% with Infinity Edge

Floating damage display now sums total damage on a single target alongside the individual hits.

Dr. Mundo
E bonus AD decreased.

The good doctor is overperforming in lower skill brackets so we're toning down his power a bit, reducing his less visible damage while retaining his durability and satisfying cleavers Mundo players love.
E - Blunt Force Trauma
Bonus Attack Damage: 2/2.25/2.5/2.75/3% maximum health ⇒
2/2.2/2.4/2.6/2.8% maximum health


Poppy
Base armor decreased, armor growth increased. Q damage adjusted.

We're making some adjustments to Poppy due to how powerful she is as a support despite being more balanced elsewhere. To bring her roles closer together, we're nerfing her early game but letting her out-scale this nerf with levels and gold, which top and jungle players acquire more readily.
Base Stats
Base Armor: 38 ⇒
35

Armor Growth: 4.7 ⇒
5

Q - Hammer Shock
Damage: 40/60/80/100/120 (+90% bonus AD) (+9% of target's maximum health) ⇒
30/55/80/105/130 (+100% bonus AD) (+9% of target's maximum health)


Rell
Base health increased. Passive resistances stolen and minimum steal increased. W shield increased.

Rell's changes last patch landed her weaker than we wanted so we're correcting that with some meaningful buffs in this patch. We'd like to make sure she feels like she can front-line as a low-income tank, so we're reinforcing that gameplay with a stronger passive.
Base Stats
Base Health: 610 ⇒
640

Passive - Break The Mold
Resistances Stolen: 2% ⇒
3%

Minimum Steal: 1-2 ⇒
1.5 - 3 (linear scaling)

W - Ferromancy: Crash Down
Shield: 15/40/65/90/115 (+12% of maximum health) ⇒
25/50/75/100/125 (+13% of maximum health)


Riven
E shield decreased.

Riven is performing a bit too well, particularly in high skill brackets. Her level nine, Eclipse power spike gained a meaningful amount of damage with the 14.20 buff that we'd like to retain, but now it will come as a tradeoff to her early vulnerability through E.
E - Valor
Shield: 80/105/130/155/180 (+110% bonus AD) ⇒
70/95/120/145/170 (+ 110% bonus AD)


Rumble
Q damage increased. W shield increased.

Rumble ended up in a not-so-hot spot after several nerfs to reduce his power levels in Pro. Since he's weaker in the early game, we're compensating him with better late-game damage on his main damaging ability with improved survivability on his W.
Q - Flamespitter
Total Damage: 60/90/120/150/180 (+100% AP) (+6/7/8/9/10% of target's maximum health) ⇒
60/90/120/150/180 (+110% AP) (+6/7/8/9/10% of target's maximum health)

W - Scrap Shield
Shield: 25/55/85/115/145 (+25% AP) (+4% of maximum health) ⇒
25/55/85/115/145 (+ 30% AP) (+ 4% of maximum health)


Swain
Base armor and armor growth decreased.

Swain is flying a bit too high right now, most notably in mid and bot lane. As a result, we're making him a little squishier to physical damage so some mid laners and ADCs in the bot lane have a better chance to succeed against him.
Base Stats
Base Armor: 26 ⇒
25

Armor Growth: 5.2 ⇒
4.7


Talon
Base MR decreased. Passive monster damage modifier decreased.

Talon's been a truly excellent jungler and mid laner in higher-skilled play so we need to take a bit of pep out of his step. We're pulling back some of his extremely fast mid-game jungle clear and abnormally high magic resist which should be impactful nerfs to both his jungle and mid gameplay.
Base Stats
Base Magic Resistance: 39 ⇒
36

Passive - Blade's End
Monster Damage Modifier: 120% ⇒
110%


Twitch
Q attack speed and attack speed duration increased.

Twitch is one of the harder ADCs to play due to his unique play style as a quasi-assassin. But even with that in mind, we don't think he should lose quite as many games as he currently does. To help our favorite rat, we're giving a small power injection for all the smelly-rat enjoyers out there. His attack speed duration will now match his ult duration, plus a little extra oomph to bring up his power levels.
Q - Ambush
Attack Speed Duration: 5 ⇒
6 seconds

Attack Speed: 40/45/50/55/60% ⇒
45/50/55/60/65%


Viktor
All abilities adjusted.

We've got quite the update (evolution) ready for Viktor this patch to better align his in-game and in-show portrayal in Arcane. We've got quite a few changes lined up, so let's jump straight into our goals.
For his passive, we'd like for Viktor to be able to evolve a bit more consistently each game, so we're shifting some of his Hex Fragments from champion kills to cannon minions which should help on this front. Next up, we have some buffs to his Q and E to improve Viktor's early game a bit that should help encourage him to be a bit more willing to take trades in lane. His W received a lot of under the hood work, but overall should benefit from some quality of life changes. Lastly, and perhaps the biggest change, Viktor's R now receives an upgrade once fully evolved that lets his Arcane Storm grow in size with each takedown, really capturing the world ending potential he showcased in Arcane. 
Passive - Glorious Evolution
Hex Fragments from Cannon Minions: 5 ⇒
10

Hex Fragments from Takedowns: 25 ⇒
20

Q - Siphon Power
Shield: 25-105 (based on level) (+18% AP) ⇒
40-115 (based on level) (+18% AP)

W - Gravity Field
Slow: 30/33/37/40/45 ⇒
33/36/39/42/45

Time Spent in Gravity Field before Stun: 1.1-2.5 (varied, random) ⇒
1.25 seconds

Bugfix: Gravity Field will no longer fail to stun in the appropriate amount of time
Slow Application: Can no longer be slowed after being stunned by W ⇒
Slow now applies as long as you are within the Gravity Field

Slow Debuff Duration: 1 ⇒
0.25 seconds

QoL Improvement: Improved reliability and consistency in addition to a few bugfixes
E - Hextech Ray
Mana Cost: 70/80/90/100/110 ⇒
60/70/80/90/100

R - Arcane Storm
Glorious Evolution: Ultimate can now evolve after evolving all other abilities and collecting 100 more hex fragments
Obliterate: Evolving Arcane Storm now makes the storm grow 40% in size and gain +3 seconds of duration if it damages an enemy that dies. Maximum of 6 size increases and maximum of +6 second overall duration increase.

Warwick
In this patch we're providing a feels improvement as a follow-up to the changes we made last month. We're starting by slightly increasing Q's tap range to make up for the difference that slightly increased his range and hitbox size as a result of the size growth. Next up, W's attack speed buff now has a much longer duration in addition to a few QoL improvements which should make our favorite dad smoother to play. We're dropping his base AD a touch just to make room for these other buffs.
Base Stats
Base Attack Damage: 65 ⇒
63

Q - Jaws of the Beast
Cast Range: 350 ⇒
365

W - Blood Hunt
Attack Speed Buff Duration: 0.75 ⇒
2 seconds

Attack speed buff is now granted on the attack or spell that puts the target below the health threshold
Warwick's attack speed is now granted on the first attack on a new target that is below the health threshold

Yuumi
Q mana cost decreased, damage increased.

Yuumi's performing worse than she ought to and is in the unfortunate position of her most common skill order (maxing Prowling Projectile) being weaker than alternatives. We're hoping to rectify this disparity with some rank-up buffs.
Q - Prowling Projectile
Mana Cost: 50/60/70/80/90/100 ⇒
50/55/60/65/70/75 mana

Minimum Damage: 60/90/120/150/180/210 (+20% AP) ⇒

Maximum Damage: 80/135/190/245/300/355 (+30% AP) ⇒
80/140/200/260/320/380 (+30% AP)
